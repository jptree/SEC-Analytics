1.                                           Organization and Basis of Presentation  

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Seneca
Gaming Corporation, or SGC, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, or collectively,
the Company. In consolidation, all intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do
not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted
accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of the
Company s management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals,
considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating
results for the three months ended December 31, 2005 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended September 30,
2006. For further information, reference is made to the consolidated financial
statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005.  

SGC, which was formed on August 1, 2002, is wholly owned by the
Seneca Nation of Indians, or the Nation. The Nation is a federally recognized
Indian tribe with total territorial land comprising approximately 54,000 acres
in the Western New York region. SGC was organized by the Nation to operate and
manage its Class III Gaming activities pursuant to the Indian Gaming
Regulatory Act of 1988, or IGRA. Under IGRA, federally recognized Indian tribes
are permitted to conduct full-scale casino gaming operations on tribal land,
subject to, among other things, the negotiation of a compact with the affected
state. Pursuant to IGRA, the Nation entered into the Nation-State Gaming
Compact with the State of New York in August, 2002, or the Compact, which has
been approved by the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of the
Interior. The Compact provides the Nation the exclusive right to conduct Class III
gaming activities at three sites in the western region of the State of New
York.  

The
Nation s Constitution established the Tribal Council, or the Council, to act as
the Nation s legislative authority. The Council acts on the Nation s behalf
with respect to SGC, and the Council established the Seneca Gaming Authority,
or SGA, to regulate the gaming activities of SGC under the Compact.  

The
Council, at the request of the SGC Board of Directors, chartered three
subsidiary corporations of SGC to operate the three sites authorized by the
Compact. In addition, the SGC Board of Directors hired the executive management
of SGC, including the President and Chief Executive Officer, to oversee,
develop, and manage the three sites. The subsidiary corporations are as
follows:  

Seneca Niagara Falls Gaming Corporation, or SNFGC  

Seneca Territory Gaming Corporation, or STGC  

Seneca Erie Gaming Corporation, or SEGC  

4  

SNFGC
was formed on August 1, 2002 to operate the Nation s gaming activities in
Niagara Falls, New York. Operations at SNFGC s casino, or Seneca Niagara
Casino, commenced December 31, 2002. 
On December 30, 2005, SNFGC officially opened the first 10 of 26
floors of rooms of its luxury hotel, which includes 35,000 square feet of
additional gaming space, 3 new restaurants, 3 new retail stores an d a 25,200 square-foot multi-purpose room and
an additional 8,000 square feet of conference and banquet space.  The luxury hotel is adjacent and
connected to the Seneca Niagara Casino.  The
entire complex, including the luxury hotel and the Seneca Niagara Casino, is
referred to as the Seneca Niagara Casino and Hotel. 

STGC
was formed on September 20, 2003 to operate the Nation s gaming activities
in Salamanca, New York on its territorial land. Operations at STGC s casino, or
Seneca Allegany Casino, commenced May 1, 2004.  

SEGC
was formed on August 9, 2003 to operate the Nation s gaming activities in
Erie County, New York. On October 3, 2005, the Nation acquired
approximately nine acres of land in the historic waterfront district of
downtown Buffalo.  SEGC commenced
construction of SEGC s Erie County gaming facility on those nine acres on December 8,
2005.  The exclusive right, under the
Compact, to establish and operate a third Class III gaming facility in
Erie County may terminate if the Nation or SEGC fails to commence Class III
gaming operations by December 9, 2007.  

2.                                           Long-Term Debt  

Long-term debt, as described below, consists of the 2004 and 2005 7 % senior
notes.  

7 %
Senior Notes   

On May 5, 2004, SGC issued $300.0 million in 7 % senior notes
due 2012, or the 2004 senior notes. The 2004 senior notes are guaranteed by SNFGC,
STGC and SEGC or collectively, the Guarantors. 
The net proceeds from the 2004 senior notes were, or will be, used principally
to fund in whole or in part (a) the repayment in May 2004 of vendor
equipment financing, (b) SNFGC s construction and equipping of the luxury
hotel, (c) the acquisition of the remaining 24 acres in Niagara Falls, as
provided for in the Compact, (d) the payment of $22.0 million in August 2004
to satisfy the obligation to the Empire State Development Corporation in
connection with the transfer of certain property to the Nation for use as the
Seneca Niagara Casino, and (e) a $25.0 million distribution to the Nation,
paid in 2004.  

On May 23, 2005, SGC issued an additional $200.0 million in 7 %
senior notes due 2012, Series B, or the 2005 senior notes. The 2005 senior
notes are treated as a single class with the 2004 senior notes and are
identical to the 2004 senior notes, except for certain tax attributes and prior
to November 1, 2005 the amount of interest accrued thereon.  Gross proceeds on the 2005 senior notes were approximately
$193.0 million.  Such proceeds were, or
will be, used to (a) pay in full and terminate on May 23, 2005, the senior
secured term loan, or the Term Loan, made by Freemantle Limited, or Freemantle,
to SNFGC in November 2002, for a negotiated amount of approximately $126.7
million, representing $80.0 million in outstanding principal and approximately
$46.7 million for interest on such principal, at a prescribed interest rate,
that would have otherwise been payable if the Term Loan had not been paid on May 23,
2005, but was instead paid 8  months prior to its November 22, 2007 stated
maturity, (b) to fund certain costs associated with the expansion of our
operations, (c) to pay the fees and expenses associated with the offering
of the 2005 senior notes and (d) for general corporate purposes.  

5  

Interest on the 2004 and 2005 senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 1
and November 1. The 2004 and 2005 senior notes are unsecured and rank
equally. As of December 31, 2005, aggregate accrued interest on the 2004
and 2005 senior notes was $6.0 million.  

The Indenture governing the 2004 and 2005 senior notes contains certain
financial and non-financial covenants. The financial covenants include
limitations on restricted payments and the incurrence of indebtedness, while
the non-financial covenants include reporting obligations and compliance with
laws and regulations. As of December 31, 2005, SGC was in compliance with
all covenants in the Indenture.  

Term
Loan   

SNFGC entered into a five year Term Loan with Freemantle on November 22,
2002. The Term Loan provided $80.0 million in financing for the initial
construction of the Seneca Niagara Casino and other related costs.  

As
discussed above, on May 23, 2005, the Term Loan was paid in full. The
negotiated payment in full of the Term Loan resulted in a charge to earnings in
May 2005 on the early extinguishment of the Term Loan of approximately $49.2
million, including the write-off of $2.5 million of deferred financing costs.  

Derivative
Instruments   

SGC is
considered an  end user  of derivative instruments and has engaged in
derivative transactions for risk management purposes only. Effective on May 25,
2004, SGC entered into two interest rate cap agreements for an aggregate
notional amount of $80.0 million, equal to the then outstanding balance of
the Term Loan. The instruments were purchased for approximately
$1.1 million each, $2.2 million in total. Periodic changes in the
fair market value of the instruments were recorded as adjustments to interest
expense. Both instruments were sold in the third quarter of 2005 subsequent to
the payment in full and termination of the Term Loan.  Gross proceeds from the sale of these
instruments were $0.7 million.  

3.                                               Related-Party Transactions    

Land
Leases from the Nation   

The Nation entered into an
operating lease agreement (Head Lease) with SNFGC on October 25, 2002, for
use of the land and the building which is currently a portion of the Seneca
Niagara Casino and Hotel. The Seneca Niagara Casino and Hotel lease term is for
21 years and currently requires monthly rent payments of $1.25 million.  Rent payments of $1.0 million per month commenced
July 1, 2003. Rent payments were increased from $1.0 million to $1.25
million per month, effective June 1, 2005. 
Effective October 1, 2005, the lease payments may increase by 3%
annually and each October 1 thereafter over the remaining lease life.  

6  

Annual
increases must be authorized by the board of directors of SGC and, subject to
compliance with the terms of the Indenture governing the senior notes, may
exceed 3%.  Rent is payable only to the
extent that sufficient funds are available, measured on an annual basis, from
the net proceeds derived from the operation of the casino facility and other
commercial activities related to the operation of the casino.  If on an annual basis sufficient funds are
not available, any shortfall in the rent amount does not accumulate.  Due to the related party nature of this
lease, which can be effectively modified by the Nation, the Company records monthly
lease expense equal to the payment amount for the respective month.  During the fiscal quarter ended December 31,
2005 and 2004, SNFGC made lease payments to the Nation of $3.8 million and $3.0
million, respectively.  The lease
contains no renewal options or escalation clauses.  

STGC leases the land upon which the Seneca Allegany Casino operates
from the Nation pursuant to an oral agreement. The monthly lease payment was
$1.0 million effective October 1, 2004 and $1.25 million effective March 1,
2005.  Effective October 1, 2005,
the lease payments may increase by 3% annually and each October 1 thereafter
over the remaining lease life.  Annual
increases must be authorized by the board of directors of SGC and, subject to
compliance with the terms of the Indenture governing the senior notes, may
exceed 3%.  During the fiscal quarters
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, STGC made lease payments to the Nation of
$3.8 million and $3.0 million, respectively. 
There is no present oral agreement as to renewal options or escalation.  

Other Related Party Transactions   

Both SNFGC and
STGC have entered into construction management agreements with Seneca
Construction Management Corporation (SCMC) for the construction of the luxury
hotel project at Seneca Niagara Casino and the resort hotel project at Seneca
Allegany Casino.  SCMC is wholly owned by
the Nation.  For the quarter ended December 31,
2005, SNFGC and STGC have made total payments to SCMC of $37.8 million.  

As of January 1, 2005, the Company transferred all Class II
operations to the Nation, including its poker operations.  The Company leases space within both Seneca
Niagara Casino and Hotel and Seneca Allegany Casino for operation of the
poker rooms by the Nation.  For the
quarter ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded $0.2 million of
rental income and fees and at December 31, 2005, the Company has recorded
$0.5 million as a receivable from the Nation relating to poker room rentals and
fees.  

During the fiscal quarters
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company declared and paid dividends
to the Nation of $4.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively.  

During the quarter ended December 31,
2005, the Company distributed real property of $4.7 million for use in its
casino operations to the Nation.  The
distribution amount of $4.7 million for 2005 is based on the acquisition costs.  

The Company is charged by
the Nation for SGA costs, which are incurred by the Nation. SGA costs charged
to the Company were approximately $2.4 million in the quarter ended December 31,
2005, as compared to $1.9 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2004.  The Company also incurs costs which are passed
through the Nation for New York State gaming regulatory services and New York
State Police and Cattaraugus County Sheriff Department services. The Company
has recorded expenses of approximately $1.8 million in the quarter ended
December 31, 2005, and $2.1 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2004. At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, approximately $10.0 million and $6.4 million,
respectively, of the SGA, other regulatory, and police costs were recorded as
other current liabilities.  

7  

SGC incurred legal fees of $22,000
primarily for regulatory and compact matters during the quarter ended December 31,
2004 from a law firm that specializes in gaming regulatory issues in which the
former President/CEO of SGC was a partner. The former President/CEO did not
receive any remuneration from the law firm during 2004.  The Company ceased using the services of this
law firm effective November 8, 2004.  

During the quarters ended December 31,
2005 and 2004, the Company purchased $38,000 and $106,000, respectively, of
tobacco products from an entity in which the owner is a member of the Council.  

During the quarter ended December 31,
2004, the Company purchased $56,000 of bottled water from an entity which is
owned by a member of the Council. As of November 2, 2004, this individual was
no longer a member of the Council.  

STGC leases office space in a building owned by the brother of a member
of the Company s board of directors. 
During the fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, such
lease payments totaled $0 and $98,000, respectively.  At December 31, 2005, $99,000 in lease
expense was payable to this individual. 
Such amount was paid in January 2006.  

4.                                           Commitments and Contingencies  

The
Seneca Nation Compact   

Under the Compact, the Nation has agreed to contribute to the State of
New York a portion of the proceeds from the operation and conduct of each
category of gaming device for which exclusivity exists, based on the win of
such machines (cash dropped into machines, after payouts but before expenses)
and totaled on a cumulative quarterly basis to be adjusted annually at the end
of the relevant calendar year. The exclusivity fee to the State of New York for
years 1-4 is 18.0% paid on an annual basis. Thereafter, the exclusivity fee is
22.0% for years 5-7 on a semi-annual basis and 25.0% for years 8-14 on a
quarterly basis.  

Pursuant to the Compact, amounts due to New York State are payable by
the Nation. In February, 2005, Seneca Niagara Casino and Seneca Allegany casino
commenced monthly payments to the Nation of each entity s prior month s
exclusivity fees. For the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
total exclusivity fees were $16.6 million and $15.6 million, respectively. Of
the $16.6 million exclusivity fee for the three months ended December 31,
2005, $11.0 million was attributable to SNFGC and $5.6 million was attributable
to STGC.  

Additional
Casino Location and Planned Expansion   

As described in Note 1, the
Compact provides the Nation the exclusive right to conduct Class III gaming
activities at three sites in the western region of the State of New York.  The construction of our third casino site in
Erie County as well as expansion by SNFGC and STGC will require significant
capital outlays. The amount and timing of these capital expenditures are
dependent on various factors including financing availability, certain Nation
and governmental approvals, construction timelines, and the performance of its
two operating casinos.

5.                                             Class II Gaming Operations Transfer    

Effective January 1, 2005 and at the direction of the Council, the
Class II gaming operations at Seneca Niagara Casino and Seneca Allegany
Casino were transferred to the Nation.  For
the three months ended December 31, 2004, the Company had total revenues
from these Class II gaming operations of approximately $3.4 million. Also,
equipment with a net book value of $2.5 million was transferred to the Nation
on January 1, 2005.  This was
recorded as a distribution to the Nation in January 2005.  

6.                                               Subsequent Events    

In January 2006,
an action was filed in the United States District Court, Western District of
New York by various plaintiffs against the United States Department of the
Interior, the National Indian Gaming Commission and three individuals in their
official capacities as Secretary of the Interior, Acting Assistant Secretary of
the Interior for Indian Affairs and Chairman of the National Indian Gaming
Commission.  The action seeks declaratory
and injunctive relief under the Administrative Procedure Act, the Declaratory
Judgements Act, the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Indian Regulatory Gaming Act (IGRA) and
is principally directed at the decisions and actions of the defendants that
permit the construction and operation of our Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino.  The plaintiffs claim that the defendants have
failed to comply with NEPA, NHPA and IGRA and have requested that the Court
take numerous actions including declaring that the lands acquired by the Nation
pursuant to the Seneca Nation Land Claims Settlement Act (SNLCSA) are not
gaming eligible Indian lands within the meaning of IGRA and declaring that the
Compact violates IGRA.  If the plaintiffs
are successful, the Nation would be unable to conduct any gaming upon lands
acquired pursuant to SNLCSA.  

On or about February 1, 2006, an action was filed in the
New York Supreme Court, County of Erie by various plaintiffs against
George E. Pataki, in his official capacity as Governor of the State of New
York; State Gaming Officials of the New York State Wagering Board; City of
Buffalo; Common Council of the City of Buffalo; Anthony Masiello in his
previous capacity as Mayor of Buffalo; Byron Brown in his capacity as Mayor of
Buffalo; City of Buffalo Department of Public Works; Buffalo Sewer Authority;
and Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority. The action seeks directive and
injunctive relief under the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA); the
First Parks, Recreation, Historic Preservation Law (PRHPL); First City
Environmental Review Ordinance (CERO); and Freedom of Information Law (FOIL)
and is principally directed at the decisions and actions of the defendants in
connection with our Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino. The plaintiffs claim that the
defendants have failed to comply with SEQRA, PRHPL, CERO, and FOIL and have
requested that the Court take numerous actions including directing compliance
with SEQRA, PRHPL, CERO and FOIL and restraining further action relating to the
development of our Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino. If the plaintiffs are
successful, the Nation may be delayed in the completion of the Seneca Buffalo
Creek Casino at this site or may be unable to complete the Seneca Buffalo Creek
Casino at this site. Certain of these plaintiffs are also plaintiffs in the
federal lawsuit filed in January 2006 and referenced above.

Overview   

Seneca Gaming
Corporation is wholly owned by the Seneca Nation of Indians of New York and
chartered to manage and direct all of the Nation s Class III gaming
operations. The Nation entered into a Compact with New York State on August 18,
2002 that provides the Nation with the right to establish and operate three Class III
gaming facilities in Western New York. We opened our first Class III
gaming facility on Nation Territory in the City of Niagara Falls, New York on December 31,
2002, featuring Class III slot machines, table games and keno. This facility
is operated by our wholly owned subsidiary SNFGC. On May 1 2004, we opened
our second Class III gaming facility, Seneca Allegany Casino, on the
Nation s Territory in the City of Salamanca, New York. This facility features Class III
slot machines and table games. This facility is operated by our wholly owned
subsidiary STGC.  

Under
the Compact, the Nation also has an exclusive right to establish and operate a
third Class III gaming facility in Erie County, New York. On October 3,
2005, the Nation acquired approximately nine acres of land in the historic
waterfront district of downtown Buffalo. 
The Company commenced construction of its Erie County gaming facility on
those nine acres on December 8, 2005. 
The exclusive right, under the Compact, to establish and operate a third
Class III gaming facility in Erie County may terminate if the Nation or
SEGC fails to commence Class III gaming operations in Erie County by December
9, 2007.  See  Part II. Item 1. - Legal
Proceedings  for information regarding litigation related to our Seneca Buffalo
Creek Casino.

Executive Summary   

Our
Current Operations.     We currently operate two Class III
gaming facilities, Seneca Niagara Casino, in the City of Niagara Falls, New
York, and Seneca Allegany Casino, in the City of Salamanca, New York. Our
casino operations include gaming, dining, entertainment and retail. For the
three months ended December 31, 2005, approximately 95% of our net revenue
was derived from our gaming activities. 

Key
Performance Indicators.     Our operating results are
dependent on the volume of profitable patrons visiting our casinos, our ability
to attract them for repeat visits, our provision of superior service to our
patrons and the expansion of and reinvestment in our facilities. 

Seneca Niagara Casino.     Seneca
Niagara Casino currently relies primarily on drive-in and bus patrons from the
Buffalo, Niagara Falls, and Rochester areas in New York and secondarily from
the Erie, Pennsylvania area, Ohio and other parts of New York. Since opening on
December 31, 2002, Seneca Niagara Casino has experienced steady growth in
its patron base. With the partial opening of our 604-room hotel and related
amenities in December 2005 and the expected completion of the hotel and
amenities by March 31, 2006, we believe that we will be able to increase
profitable patron volume and gaming activity, extend our geographic penetration
and appeal to a more diverse demographic base. 
The luxury hotel expansion includes: 

604 rooms,
including 118 suites of various sizes, with 10 floors officially opened on December 30,
2005, and the remaining floors scheduled to open by March 31, 2006; 

35,000 square
feet of additional gaming space featuring approximately 950 slot machines and
33 table games (12 of which were relocated from the existing gaming areas),
which additional gaming space opened on December 15, 2005; 

a full-service
luxury spa and salon, scheduled to open on March 31, 2006; 

a 25,200
square-foot multi-purpose room and an additional 8,000 square feet of
conference and banquet space, all of which opened on December 31, 2005; 

two specialty
restaurants, a 24-hour casual dining restaurant and a deli, with the specialty
restaurants having opened on December 27, 2005 and January 19, 2006,
the casual dining restaurant having opened on December 23, 2005,  and the deli having opened on December 15,
2005; and 

approximately
2,300 square feet of retail space for three stores, with two stores having
opened on December 15, 2005 and one having opened on December 30, 2005. 

11  

Seneca
Allegany Casino.    Since
opening on May 1, 2004, Seneca Allegany Casino has experienced steady
growth in its patron base, net revenue, and profitability. Seneca Allegany
Casino has attracted patrons from the southern portion of Western New York,
Erie and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. From opening through December 31,
2005, approximately 66%, of the casino s patrons have come from outside of the
State of New York. 

In July 2005,
we opened our 1,850-space parking garage and we are constructing a 220-room
hotel and casino at Seneca Allegany Casino. We believe this expansion is
necessary to provide a first-class gaming experience for our patrons and to
maintain the competitive position of the facility in light of expected future casino
gaming competition in Pennsylvania. We expect that the total cost of this
expansion project, including the cost of our recently opened parking garage,
will cost between $187.0 and $198.0 million, and we plan to continue to fund
this expansion with cash flows from operations at Seneca Allegany Casino and
borrowings from SGC. We are targeting opening the entire public area space and the
first few floors of this hotel by October 22, 2006.  This target date may be extended based on
various factors, including cost, which we are currently evaluating.  We continue to plan to open the remaining
hotel floors by December 31, 2006.  

Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino   

In addition to
Seneca Niagara Casino and Seneca Allegany Casino, the Nation has the exclusive
right to construct our third Class III gaming facility in Erie County, New
York. This new Class III gaming facility, which we refer to as Seneca
Buffalo Creek Casino, is expected to cater primarily to the local market in
Buffalo and its suburbs. On October 3, 2005 the Nation acquired
approximately nine acres of land in the historic waterfront district of
downtown Buffalo.  We commenced
construction of our Erie County gaming facility on those nine acres,
constituting the Nation s Buffalo Creek Territory, on December 8,
2005.  Buffalo Creek Casino is expected
to initially feature:  

1,900 to 2,200 slot
machines; 

30 to 50 table games; 

a specialty restaurant; 

a 24-hour casual dining
restaurant; 

a nightclub; 

retail stores; and 

a 2,500-space parking
garage. 

The Nation s
exclusive right under the Compact with New York State to establish and operate
a Class III gaming facility in Erie County, New York, could have terminated
if the Nation had failed to commence construction of a Class III gaming
facility in Erie County by December 9, 2005 (and we note that we commenced
construction on December 8, 2005) and  

12  

may terminate if the Nation fails to commence
Class III gaming operations in Erie County by December 9, 2007. We
expect to open the Buffalo Creek Casino by the December 9, 2007
deadline.  The timing of the opening of
Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino will depend on various factors, including existing legal
challenges by various plaintiffs.  See Part II.
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.   In the event
that we are able to open a casino in Erie County, this casino will be owned and
operated by SEGC. We intend to operate Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino in a manner
that will complement both Seneca Niagara Casino and Seneca Allegany Casino.  

Current,
Continued and Future Reliance on Cash Flow  .      We intend to fund the
maintenance of our facilities and our planned future expansion projects from our
cash flow and cash on hand. We currently rely and will continue to rely on our
ability to generate cash flow from operations to repay our debt financing. 

Seasonality.    Our results of operations have not been
seasonal in nature. 

Overall
Outlook.     As discussed in more detail above, since
inception, we have invested heavily in our operations and plan to continue to
do so during the remainder of fiscal 2006.  We believe that investments in additional
gaming space and non-gaming amenities at our facilities and our exclusive
ability to offer Class III gaming in Western New York, will enable us to
capitalize on what we believe is an underserved market in Western New York,
Pennsylvania and parts of Ohio. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   

There have been no
changes in critical accounting policies and estimates since the filing of our  2005 Form 10-K for the year ended September 30,
2005. 

Operating Results - Three Months Ended December 31,
2005 Compared to the Three Months Ended December 31, 2004   

Operating Results   

13  

The most important
factors and trends contributing to our operating performance during the three
months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 were:  

Our
ability to successfully market Seneca Niagara Casino and Seneca Allegany Casino
to our primary and secondary target markets located within 100 miles and 175
miles, respectively, of such casinos. 

Our
ability to enroll approximately 1.0 million patrons in our cross-property
Seneca Link Player s Card program, which has increased our ability to use
effective direct mail and targeted marketing programs to establish patron
loyalty to the Seneca brand at a profitable level. 

Our
mix of slot machines, which we believe is superior to our competition and
includes the latest product introductions by leading United States and
international slot manufacturers. 

Our
use of current information technology, including  ticket-in/ticket-out  slot
machines, automated jackpot payment machines, coinless slots, electronic slot
bonusing and database programs to increase operating efficiencies. 

Our
ability to operate at a high margin, which we achieve through the careful
monitoring and control of labor costs and the effective use of our marketing
and advertising expenditures. 

Our
continued expansion at and reinvestment in both of our properties, most notably
our progress with the luxury hotel expansion project at Seneca Niagara Casino
and the resort hotel expansion project at Seneca Allegany Casino. 

Detailed
Revenue Information   

14  

Our gaming revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2005
increased relative to the comparable period last year due to the opening of the
additional gaming space at Seneca Niagara Casino on December 15, 2005,
which added approximately 950 slot machines and 21 table games to our
operations, the addition of 69 slot machines at Seneca Allegany Casino and
continued growth in our patron base. As of December 31, 2005, our casinos
had an aggregate of 124 table games and 6,227 slot machines  available to
our patrons, representing a net increase of 2 table games and a net increase of
1,100 slot machines from December 31, 2004. During these periods, the
number of patrons enrolled in our Seneca Link Player s Card program has
steadily increased. As of December 31, 2005, we had over 1.0 million
patrons enrolled, an increase of over 300,000 
patrons over the number of enrolled members at December 31, 2004.  

Our net gaming
revenue, net of promotional credits of $6.5 million and $2.4 million in the
quarters ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, increased $1.6 million,
or 2%, for the three months ended December 31, 2005 relative to the
comparable period ended December 31, 2004. Net gaming revenue for the
quarter ended December 31, 2004 included $3.4 million in Class II
gaming revenue. These Class II gaming operations were transferred to the Nation
on January 1, 2005.  During the three
months ended December 31, 2005, Seneca Niagara Casino net gaming revenue decreased
$1.6 million, or 2%. This decrease reflects $1.4 million of Class II
poker revenue in the prior year, that did not occur in the current year.  Seneca Allegany Casino s net gaming revenue
for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 was $34.0 million, an increase of
$3.3 million or 11% from the quarter ended December 31, 2004.  This increase was mainly due to a $4.9
million increase in net slot revenue, partially offset by a reduction of $1.9
million in Class II gaming revenue in 2004 which did not occur in 2005,
and a $0.3 million increase in table games revenue.  

Our food and
beverage revenue and retail revenue have increased in direct relation to our
increase in gaming revenue. There is a direct relation between our food and
beverage revenue and retail revenue to our gaming revenue because a significant
portion of this revenue is from players  point redemptions. For the three months
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, 61% and 53%, respectively, of our food
and beverage revenue and 88% and 87% of our retail revenue, respectively,
represented players  point redemptions. For the three months ended December 31,
2005, food and beverage revenue increased $0.1 million, or 1% to $9.8 million.
For the three months ended December 31, 2005 Seneca Allegany Casino
generated an additional $0.4 million in food and beverage revenue compared to
the prior period, primarily due to increased utilization of players  points during
2005. Seneca Niagara Casino s food and beverage revenue for the quarter ended December 31,
2005 decreased $0.3 million in relation to the comparable prior year period, mainly
due to the October 2005 closure of one of its restaurants, which was
replaced by an upscale nightclub in mid-December 2005.  

For the three
months ended December 31, 2005, our retail, entertainment and other
revenue increased by $0.5 million in relation to the comparable 2004
period. This increase was primarily attributable to higher revenue at our
Seneca Allegany Casino of $0.5 million, due to increased utilization of players 
points during 2005.  

15  

Detailed Operating Expenses Information   

Gaming expenses
principally consist of costs incurred from operating our table games and slot
machines, of which the primary components are related payroll and employee
benefit costs, and the slot exclusivity fee due to New York State pursuant to
the Compact. The slot exclusivity fee increased by $1.0 million from $15.6 million
for the three months ended December 31, 2004 to $16.6 million for the
three months ended December 31, 2005. 
This increase was offset by a $1.2 million decrease in promotional
expenses, along with a $0.4 million decrease in payroll and benefits costs.  

Currently, the
exclusivity fee is 18% of the slot machine net drop (money dropped into the
machines after payout but before our expenses). This fee will increase to 22%
on January 1, 2007 and to 25% on January 1, 2010.  

Food and beverage expenses
are costs we incur for the operation of our restaurants, snack bars and
beverage outlets. The primary components of these expenses are the cost of food
and beverages and related payroll and employee benefit expenses.  

Retail,
entertainment and other expenses represent our costs to operate our retail
shops and entertainment offerings. The components of these expenses include
related payroll and employee benefit costs, the purchase of products offered
for sale in our retail outlets, and contract costs for entertainers. For the
three months ended December 31, 2005 in relation to the same period in
2004, these costs increased approximately $0.1 million, or 5%, due mainly to
higher retail revenues in the current year.  

Advertising,
general and administrative expenses are incurred to support our operations.
These expenses consist primarily of related payroll and employee benefits
costs, regulatory, advertising, rent, marketing, insurance, legal and energy
costs. For the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, such costs
were $31.4 million and $29.2 million, a $2.2 million increase, or 8%.  This was mainly attributable to a $1.7
million increase in the head lease expense with the Nation for both casinos in
relation to the same period in 2004, along with a $0.3 million increase in insurance
costs in the three months ended December 31, 2005 over the same period in
2004.  

16  

Non-Operating Expenses   

The following
table summarizes information related to interest on our long-term debt:  

Our interest cost
for the three months ended December 31, 2005 decreased $4.2 million over
the three months ended December 31, 2004. This decrease was primarily attributable
to the  payment in
full and termination of SNFGC s Term Loan
in May 2005, partially offset by additional interest relating to the $200
million in 2005 senior notes issued in May 2005. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Cash Flows   

Cash
Flows Operating Activities.     The decrease in cash
flows from operations during the three months ended December 31, 2005
compared to the same period in 2004 resulted principally from the change in
payment frequency regarding state exclusivity fees. In January 2005, the
Company paid exclusivity fees related to the entire 2004 calendar year.  Subsequent to that payment, the Company began
paying exclusivity fees on a monthly basis for the prior month s fees due.  Exclusivity fees for the quarter ended December 31,
2004 (paid in 2005) were $15.6 million. 

Cash
Flows Investing Activities.     Our capital
expenditures of $58.7 million during the three months ended December 31,
2005 were mainly comprised of $50.8 million of costs associated with the
construction and equipping of the Seneca Niagara Casino luxury hotel and 

17  

$1.7 million related
to the construction of the Seneca Allegany Casino garage and hotel.  The remaining capital expenditures were
principally for the acquisition of equipment for the existing casino
operations, the cogeneration plant and the nightclub at Seneca Niagara Casino.
Purchases of investments represent short-term investments of excess cash in
instruments having a maturity of more than 90 days.  

We intend to
acquire the remaining approximately 24 acres of the approximately 50 acres in
the City of Niagara Falls, New York, designated by New York State under the
Compact for ownership by the Nation. Under the Compact, the Nation is required
to fund the acquisition of this property, including all related costs and
expenses. As initial security for the Nation s obligations to pay site
acquisition costs and in furtherance of the ongoing condemnation proceeding,
the Nation was required to deliver, and has delivered, to the Empire State
Development Corporation, or ESDC, a letter of credit in the amount of $33.5
million representing 150% of the then estimate of the total remaining site
acquisition costs not yet paid by the Nation. 
If the estimate of such site acquisition costs increases or if certain
other events occur, the Nation may have to provide an additional letter of
credit or replace the existing one with one for a larger monetary amount or, if
acceptable to the ESDC, provide a supplemental cash escrow amount.  This outstanding letter of credit is 100%
collateralized by a cash deposit in an interest-bearing restricted account with
a bank.  

Cash Flows Financing Activities.        During
the quarter ended December 31, 2004, the Company paid $12.0 million into a
sinking fund related to the the Term Loan. 
In May 2005, the Term Loan was terminated and the sinking fund
balance (including accumulated earnings) was transferred to cash and short-term
investments. 

Principal
Debt Arrangements.     As of December 31, 2005,
our long-term debt consists of $300.0 million in 2004 senior notes and $200.0
million in 2005 senior notes. We pay a fixed interest rate of 7 % annually on
both the 2004 and 2005 senior notes. 

During the next
24 months, we plan to make substantial capital improvements to our gaming
facilities. In December 2005, at Seneca Niagara Casino we had a partial
opening of a new 604-room luxury hotel, including 35,000 square feet of
additional gaming space with approximately 950 slot machines and several new restaurants
and retail stores. We expect the total cost to construct and equip the luxury
hotel to be approximately $235.0 to $240.0 million.  We also expect the luxury hotel to be
completed by March 31, 2006.  

We have
constructed a 1,850 space-parking garage and are constructing a 220-room hotel and
casino at our Seneca Allegany Casino. We estimate the total cost to complete
this project to be between $187.0 million and $198.0 million. The
garage opened on July 1, 2005.  We are
targeting opening all public areas and the first few floors of this hotel by October 22,
2006.  This target date may be extended based
on various factors, including cost, which we are currently evaluating.   We
continue to plan to complete the project by December 31, 2006.  

On May 23, 2005, SGC issued an additional $200.0 million in 7 %
senior notes due 2012, Series B, or the 2005 senior notes. The 2005 senior
notes are treated as a single class with the 2004 senior notes and are
identical to the 2004 senior notes, except for certain tax attributes and prior
to November 1, 2005 the amount of interest accrued thereon.  Gross proceeds on the  

18  

2005
senior notes were approximately $193.0 million. Such proceeds were, or will be,
used to (a) pay in full and terminate on May 23, 2005, the senior
secured term loan, or the Term Loan, made by Freemantle Limited, or Freemantle,
to SNFGC in November 2002, for a negotiated amount of approximately $126.7
million, representing $80.0 million in outstanding principal and approximately
$46.7 million for interest on such principal, at a prescribed interest rate,
that would have otherwise been payable if the Term Loan had not been paid on May 23,
2005, but was instead paid 8  months prior to its November 22, 2007 stated
maturity (resulting in a reduction of future interest payments that would have
otherwise been payable under the Term Loan if it had not been paid in full, by
approximately $18.0 million), (b) to fund certain costs associated with
the expansion of our operations, (c) to pay the fees and expenses
associated with the offering of the 2005 senior notes and (d) for general
corporate purposes.  Interest on the 2004
and 2005 senior notes is payable semi-annually on November 1 and May 1.
The 2004 and 2005 senior notes are unsecured and rank equally. As of December 31,
2005, aggregate accrued interest on the 2004 and 2005 senior notes was $6.0 million.  

We expect cash
generated from our operations, available cash and cash equivalents and
short-term investments as of December 31, 2005 to be sufficient to fund
our expansion plans described above, service our debt, and meet our working
capital requirements for the near future. 
However, our ability to fund our operations, make planned capital
expenditures and service our debt depends on our future operating performance
and cash flow, which are in turn subject to prevailing economic conditions and
to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.
Additionally, unlike traditional corporations, we are prohibited by law from
generating cash through an offering of equity securities. Also, our ability to
incur additional indebtedness is limited under the terms of the indenture
governing the 2004 and 2005 senior notes.  

We are highly
leveraged and have significant interest payment requirements on our 2004 and
2005 senior notes. As such, limitations on our capital resources could force us
to delay or abandon capital projects as well as the construction and
development of new properties.  

Item 3.                                                               Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Reference is made
to our 2005 Form 10-K for a complete discussion of the Company s market
risk. This market risk information has not materially changed in the interim
period.  

Regulation   

Our operations are
regulated by Nation laws, the Compact and federal statutes, most notably the
Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, or IGRA. Several bills have been proposed during
the current and recent sessions of U.S. Congress that could affect Indian
gaming. Notably, though its proposed legislation has yet to be presented to
Congress, the Policies and Procedures Subproject of the Bureau of Indian
Affairs has proposed sweeping changes to the federal laws concerning Indians.
Certain of such bills, if enacted, could impair the ability of the Nation and
SGC to expand its gaming operations and adversely impact the future growth of
the Nation s revenue base. In addition, from time to time, various government
officials have proposed taxing Indian casino gaming or otherwise limiting or
restricting the conduct of gaming operations by  

19  

Indian tribes. No
assurance can be given that such legislation, if and when enacted by Congress,
would not have a material adverse effect on the operations of SGC.  Senator John McCain, Chairman of the Senate
Indian Committee, has held a couple of hearings regarding possible amendments
to IGRA. As it relates particularly to off-reservation gaming, there have been
several Congressional hearings held by both the Seneca Indian Affairs Committee
and the House Resources Committee.  House
Resources Committee Chairman Richard Pombo has circulated a draft bill, which
has not been introduced, to amend the IGRA to restrict off-reservation gaming
activities by tribes. On November 18, 2005, Senator McCain introduced S.
2078, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act Amendments of 2005.  S. 2078 makes a number of amendments to IGRA,
including: (1) expanding the authority of the National Indian Gaming
Commission ( NIGC ) over  gaming-related contracts , (2) authorizing the
NIGC to regulate Class III gaming, (3) limiting the lands eligible
for gaming, and (4) making a number of technical amendments to IGRA.  The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs has
held one hearing on S. 2078, and it is expected that it will hold a series of
hearings in connection with S. 2078.  If
Congress were to enact comprehensive amendments to IGRA, such legislation could
have a material adverse effect on the operations of SGC. In addition, under
federal law, gaming on the Nation s lands may be dependent upon the
permissibility under New York law of certain forms of gaming or similar
activities. If New York State were to make various forms of gaming illegal or
against public policy (or the courts were to rule similarly), or otherwise
to take a legal position adverse to the Compact or any of its provisions, such
actions could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our casinos to
conduct their gaming operations as currently conducted. Moreover, a 1996 U.S.
Supreme Court decision may permit a state to avoid or refuse to negotiate amendments
to existing compacts such as the Compact.  

New Accounting Pronouncements   

There are no
accounting standards that have not yet been adopted which are expected to have
a material impact on our financial reporting.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures   

We maintain
disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act)
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President
and Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President of Finance and
Administration, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, have inherent limitations due to cost issues, the
possibility of human error, judgments and assumptions regarding the likelihood
of future events, and the circumvention and overriding of the controls and
procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure of controls and procedures
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
objectives.  

20  

The Company s
management, under the supervision and with participation of our President and Chief
Executive Officer and Senior Vice President of Finance and Administration (as
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively),
has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief
Executive Officer and Senior Vice President of Finance and Administration have concluded
that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31,
2005 provided reasonable assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures
are effective to accomplish their objectives.  

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There has not been
any change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in
connection with the evaluation required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or
15d-15 or otherwise that occurred during the quarter ended December 31,
2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
