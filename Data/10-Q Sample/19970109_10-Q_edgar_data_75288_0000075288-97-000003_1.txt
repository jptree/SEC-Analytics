OXFORD INDUSTRIES, INC.
              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
         QUARTERS ENDED NOVEMBER 29, 1996 AND DECEMBER 1, 1995

1.      The  foregoing unaudited consolidated financial statements
  reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management,
  necessary  to  a fair statement of the results for  the  interim
  periods.  All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.
  The  results for interim periods are not necessarily  indicative
  of results to be expected for the year.

2.     The financial information presented herein should be read in
  conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  included
  in  the  Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the  fiscal
  year ended May 31, 1996.

3.      The Company is involved in certain legal matters primarily
  arising  in  the normal course of business.  In the  opinion  of
  management,  the Company's liability under any of these  matters
  would  not materially affect its financial condition or  results
  of operations.

Item 2 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
                         Results of Operations

NET SALES
     Net sales for the second quarter of the 1997 fiscal year, which
ended November 29, 1996, increased 8.6% from net sales for the same
period of the prior year.  Net sales for the first six months of the
current year decreased by 0.2% from net sales for the same period of
the prior year.

     Second quarter net sales increases in the Company's Men's Slacks
Group, Tailored Clothing Group and Womenswear Group were slightly
offset by decreases in the Men's Shirt Group and last year's
divestiture (B.J. Designs) and closure (RENNY(r)).  Within the Company's
Men's Shirt Group, increased sales for Tommy Hilfiger(r) Golf, Tommy
Hilfiger Dress shirts and Polo(r) for Boys were offset by declines in
the private label lines while Ely & Walker net sales were flat with
last year.  The decline in the Men's Shirt Group private label net
sales is attributable to the Company's exit from the wet process
"wrinkle-free" product.

     The Company experienced an overall net sales unit volume increase
of 7.6% while experiencing an overall 1.0% increase in the averages
sales price per unit during the second quarter of the current year.
Second quarter net sales included greater increased sales in the
Company's licensed designer divisions  (with higher average sales per
unit) than in the private label divisions.  For the first six months
of the current year the Company experienced a 5.6% decrease in overall
net sales unit volume while managing a 5.7% increase in the average
sales price per unit.

COST OF GOODS SOLD
     Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales, was 81.8% in the
second quarter of the current year as compared to 83.0% in the second
quarter of the prior year.  For the first half of the current fiscal
year, cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 81.8% and
83.0% for the first half of the prior fiscal year.  The decrease in
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was due in part to the
increased sales of higher margin lines.  Another factor contributing
to the decreased percentage was the continuation of the shift from
domestic production to offshore production yielding relative decreased
costs per unit.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
     Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 2.8% to
$24,890,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 1997 from $25,596,000 in
the same period of fiscal 1996.  Selling, general and administrative
expenses decreased by 2.6% to $49,576,000 for the first six months of
the current year from $50,914,000 for the first six months of the
prior year.  As a percentage of net sales, selling general and
administrative expenses decreased to 12.2% for the second quarter of
the current year from 13.7% for the second quarter of the prior year,
and decreased to 13.2% for the first half of the current year from
13.5% for the first half of the prior year.  The decrease in selling,
general and administrative expenses are predominantly the result of
last year's divisional divestiture (B.J. Designs) and closure (RENNY).

INTEREST EXPENSE
     Net interest expense declined by $805,000 to $1,071,000 or 0.5%
of net sales in the second quarter of the current year from $1,876,000
or 1.0% of net sales in the second quarter of the prior year.  Net
interest expense declined by $1,550,000 to $2,167,000 or 0.6% of net
sales in the first half of the current year from $3,717,000 or 1.0% of
net sales in the first half of the prior year.  The reduction in
interest expense was due primarily to the reduced inventory from the
prior year.

INCOME TAXES
     The Company's effective tax rate was 40.0% in the second quarter
of both the current and previous year and for the first half of both
the current and previous year and does not differ significantly from
the Company's statutory rate.

FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS
     At the current writing, the Christmas retail results appear to
have been mixed with most retailers expecting only modest single-digit
percentage sales gains.  The Company expects the continuation of
highly competitive market conditions at wholesale and at retail.  The
Company expects to produce a solid single-digit sales gain in the
second half.  If the Company's sales expectations are achieved, the
Company expects a solidly profitable second half.

                    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

OPERATING ACTIVITIES
     Operating activities generated $6,978,000 during the first six
months of the current year and $20,529,000 in the first six months of
the prior year.  The primary factors contributing to this reduced
generation of funds was a smaller decrease in trade payables offset by
increased receivables and a smaller decrease in inventory than from
the prior year.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES
     Investing activities used $982,000 in the first half of the
current year and $11,750,000 in the first half of the prior year.  The
primary factor contributing to this change was the acquisition of Ely
& Walker in the first quarter of the prior year.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES
     Financing activities used $3,301,000 in the first half of the
current year and $6,750,000 in the first half of the prior year.  The
primary factors contributing to this change were the change in short-
term borrowings and long-term debt.
     The Company purchased and retired 100,000 shares of its common
stock during the six months ended November 29, 1996.  During the
period after the end of the second quarter through January 6,1997, no
shares have been purchased and retired.  Due to the exercise of
employee stock options a net of 12,240 shares of the Company's common
stock were issued during the first six months and 15,000 shares were
issued since November 29,1996 through January 6, 1997.

     On January 6, 1997, the Company's Board of Directors declared a
cash dividend of $.20 per share payable March 1, 1997 to shareholders
of record on February 14, 1997.

WORKING CAPITAL
     Working capital decreased from $143,107,000 at the end of the
second quarter of the prior year to $137,337,000 at the end of the
1996 fiscal year and increased to $144,639,000 at the end of the
second quarter of the current fiscal year.  The ratio of current
assets to current liabilities was 2.4 at the end of the second quarter
of the prior year, 2.4 at the end of the prior fiscal year, and 2.4 at
the end of the second quarter of the current year.

FUTURE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     The Company believes it has the ability to generate cash and/or
has available borrowing capacity to meet its foreseeable needs.  The
sources of funds primarily include funds provided by operations and
both short and long-term borrowings.  The uses of funds primarily
include working capital requirements, capital expenditures,
acquisitions, dividends and repayment of long-term debt.  The Company
regularly utilizes committed bank lines of credit and other
uncommitted bank resources to meet working capital requirements.  On
November 29, 1996, the Company had available for its use lines of
credit with several lenders aggregating $52,000,000.  The Company has
agreed to pay commitment fees for these available lines of credit.  At
November 29, 1996, $50,000,000 was in use under these lines.  Of the
$50,000,000, $40,000,000 is long-term.  In addition, the Company has
$186,000,000 in uncommitted lines of credit, of which $98,000,000 is
reserved exclusively for letters of credit.  The Company pays no
commitment fees for these available lines of credit.  At November 29,
1996, $18,000,000 was in use under these lines of credit.  Maximum
borrowings from all these sources during the first six months of the
current year were $96,000,000 of which $56,000,000 was short-term.
The Company anticipates continued use and availability of both
committed and uncommitted  resources as working capital needs may
require.

     The Company considers possible acquisitions of apparel-related
businesses that are compatible with its long-term strategies.  There
are no present plans to sell securities or enter into off-balance
sheet financing arrangements.
