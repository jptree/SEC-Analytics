Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements 

Note 1: General Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The results of operations reflect
interim adjustments, all of which are of a normal recurring nature and which, in the opinion of
management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim period presented.
The interim results for the three month periods ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 are not necessarily
indicative of the results expected for the full year. The balance sheet information for October
31, 2005, is derived from the Company s audited financial statements for the year ended October 31,
2005. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as well as other information included in
the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2005.

Principles of Consolidation  
The consolidated financial statements of Metrocorp, Inc. (the  Company  or  Metrocorp ) include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Metrobank, N.A. (the  Bank  or
 Metrobank ), and Community Insurance, Inc., but do not include Metrocorp Capital Trust I, which
under current accounting rules, no longer meets the criteria for consolidation. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Nature of Operations  
The Company is a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the
 BHCA ) headquartered in East Moline, Illinois. Incorporated in 1973 as a Delaware Corporation the
Company was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Illinois on March 15, 2004. The Company
derives the majority of its income from, and its principal asset is, all of the common stock of the
Bank. The Bank currently operates a main office, 18 branch offices, an operations center and an
office for Community Insurance which are located in the Quad Cities market, the western Illinois
market and the eastern Iowa market. The Bank has established a network of 48 ATMs in western
Illinois and eastern Iowa.

Metrobank is a full service community bank that specializes in business and individual banking. In
addition to traditional banking services such as savings and checking accounts, it offers trust
services, discount brokerage services, electronic services, internet banking and insurance
products. The Bank also offers a variety of debit and credit card programs, including affinity
credit card programs with local schools and a secured credit card program. Finally, the Bank
offers investment services through its affiliation with Primevest Financial Services, a registered
broker/dealer. Through Primevest, Metrobank customers have access to self-directed IRAs, SEP IRAs,
simple IRAs, 401(k) retirement plans, stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other products.

Earnings per Common Share  
Basic per share amounts are computed by dividing net income (the numerator) by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding (the denominator). Diluted per share amounts assume the
conversion, exercise or issuance of all potential common stock unless the effect is to reduce the
loss or increase the income per share. Allocated shares held by the employee stock ownership plan
are considered to be outstanding shares. The Company does not have
any common stock equivalents.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements  
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of

- 6 -

Table of Contents   

the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to the
adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, investments, intangible assets, income taxes and
contingencies. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. The one accounting estimate that materially affects the financial
statements is the allowance for loan losses.

Securities available-for-sale  
Securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value and consist of those securities which the
Company may decide to sell if needed for liquidity, asset/liability management, or other reasons.
Unrealized gains and losses are reported as increases or decreases in accumulated other
comprehensive income.

Presentation of cash flows  
For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on-hand and amounts
due from banks. Cash flows from loans, deposits, and short-term borrowings are treated as net
increases or decreases.

Note 2: Commitments and Contingencies  
The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of
business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include
commitments to make loans and standby letters of credit. The Company s exposure to credit loss in
the event of nonperformance by other parties to these financial instruments is represented by the
contractual amount of the instruments. The Company uses the same credit policy to make such
commitments as it uses for on-balance sheet items.

The approximate contract amounts of these instruments are summarized as follows as of:

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation
of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or
other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many the commitments are
expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a
case-by-case basis. Collateral varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and
equipment, and income producing commercial properties.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the
performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily used to support private
borrowing arrangements and extend for no more than one year. The credit risk involved in issuing
letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to
customers. Collateral held varies as specified above and is required in instances which the Bank
deems necessary.

The Company has executed contracts for the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market in the
amount of $185,000 and $1,065,000 as of January 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005, respectively. The

Table of Contents   

Company has also executed contracts for the sale of student loans in the secondary market in the
amount of $25,537,000 and $13,375,000 as of January 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005, respectively. These
amounts represent all student loans held for sale.

Concentrations of credit risk  
All of the Bank s loans, commitments to extend credit, and standby letters of credit have been
granted to customers in the Bank s market area. The distribution of commitments to extend credit
approximates the distribution of loans outstanding, and standby letters of credit were granted
primarily to commercial borrowers. Investment securities issued by state and political
subdivisions also involve governmental entities within the Bank s market area.

Aside from cash on-hand, in-vault, and balances at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, the
majority of the Bank s cash is maintained at LaSalle National Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank.

Contingencies  
In the normal course of business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings. In the
opinion of management, any liability resulting from such proceedings would not have a material
effect on the Company s financial statements.

Note 3: Recent Developments  
The Company has contacted potential buyers in connection with a potential change of control and
currently intends to negotiate a definitive agreement with one bidder. This process is described
in more detail at Item 2 Corporate Developments in Fiscal 2006 in this report.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of
operations is intended to provide a better understanding of the significant changes and trends
relating to Metrocorp s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and interest rate
sensitivity. The following discussion should be read in connection with the unaudited consolidated
financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included in Item 1 of this report. The
discussion covers the results of operations for the quarters ended January 31, 2005, and 2006, and
the financial condition for the periods ended January 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005.

Average balances, including balances used in calculating certain financial ratios, are comprised of
average daily balances for Metrocorp. Within Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, interest income and net interest income are generally
presented on a fully tax-equivalent (FTE) basis, when stating average yields, net interest margins
or spreads. Tax-exempt income has been adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis using an incremental tax
rate of 34%.

Metrocorp, Inc. is a bank holding company providing bank and bank related services through its
wholly owned subsidiary, Metrobank, N.A. and its subsidiary, Community Insurance, Inc., and
Metrocorp Capital Trust I. The Company is engaged in the business of commercial and retail banking
and trust and insurance services. The Company focuses on establishing long-term relationships with
customers, and is committed to serving the financial needs of the communities in its market area.
Metrobank maintains nineteen locations located in western Illinois and eastern Iowa with the
insurance agency located in the Miles, Iowa branch. The majority of the Company s income is
derived from commercial and retail lending, investments, and deposit activities. Metrocorp Capital
Trust I was capitalized in November 2001 for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities.

Corporate Developments in Fiscal 2006 

On August 25, 2005, the Company and its shareholders received a hostile tender offer from National
Bancshares, a privately-held community banking organization based in the Quad Cities, to purchase
all of the shares of common stock of Metrocorp for $52.00 per share in cash. The tender offer was
subject to approval of all appropriate regulatory agencies, obtaining at least 50.1% of Metrocorp s
outstanding shares, and had an expiration date of September 23, 2005. The Company hired St.
Charles Capital, LLC of Denver, Colorado to provide advisory services related to this unsolicited
tender offer. St. Charles is an experienced investment banking firm that has expertise in matters
of mergers and acquisitions in the banking industry and in the valuation of banks, with particular
expertise in independent community banks. St. Charles prepared a thorough analysis and evaluation
of the offer. With the assistance of the Company s legal and financial advisors, the Board of
Directors, after carefully considering the offer, unanimously recommended that shareholders reject
the offer and not tender any of their shares. On September 23, 2005, the offer expired as stated.

As a result of this process the Company began receiving other non-binding offers from various bank
holding companies. Realizing it was not practical or cost-efficient to deal with each of these
offers individually, the Board began a process to evaluate the strategic alternatives available to
the Company for maximizing value to its shareholders. Seven investment banking firms were
interviewed by the Board of Directors and in October 2005 Hovde Financial, LLC of Chicago, Illinois
was hired to act as the Company s financial advisor. Since that time the Company has been
diligently working with Hovde to execute a systematic process of contacting potential buyers of the
Company and obtaining external valuations of the Company in connection with a possible change of
control. This process by nature is detailed, information intensive, and thorough. A great deal of
time, energy and expense has been expended by the Board, management, and employees with this
process. Of the interested parties, there were three companies selected by the Board to perform
due diligence on the Company during February

2006. The Company has considered the final bids presented by the three interested parties and
currently intends to negotiate a definitive agreement with one potential buyer.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The Company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are
based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of
these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates,
including those related to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the impairment of
goodwill. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions
that are believed to be reasonable, under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis
for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. Management has identified its most critical accounting policies to be
those related to the allowance for loan losses and asset impairment judgments including the
recoverability of goodwill. The Company s policy related to the estimate on the allowance for loan
losses can be found in Notes 1 and 6 of the Company s audited consolidated financial statements at
Item 8 of the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2005 as filed February 28, 2006,
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs
over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a purchase acquisition. Goodwill is not
amortized but is subject to an impairment test at least annually, or more often if conditions
indicate a possible impairment.

Financial Condition 

The following discussion of the Company s consolidated financial condition should be read in
conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item
1 of this report.

The Company s total assets at January 31, 2006 were $562.8 million, a decrease of $16.2 million, or
2.8% from $579.0 million at October 31, 2005. The decrease in assets was due primarily to
decreases in securities available for sale, federal funds sold and net loans, described below, but
were partially offset by a $2.7 million increase in cash and due from banks and a $11.5 million
increase in loans held for sale.

The Company s portfolio of securities available for sale decreased $13.3 million, or 4.5%, to
$280.8 million at January 31, 2006 from $294.1 million at October 31, 2005. Part of this decrease
was the $300,000 increase in the unrealized loss at January 31, 2006 ($3.1 million) from the
unrealized loss at October 31, 2005 ($2.8 million) in accordance with SFAS 115. The Company s
portfolio consists primarily of U. S. Treasury and government obligations, state and political
subdivisions, and investment grade corporate bonds. Overall the portfolio has a weighted average
life of 3.0 years. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company purchased securities
available for sale in the amount of $8.9 million which was offset by $20.9 million in proceeds from
maturities and calls of securities available for sale. Overall there was a $13.1 million, or 4.4%,
decrease in the amortized cost of securities available for sale. The decrease was primarily as a
result of an increase in loans held for sale and a decrease in total deposits which are discussed
below.

The Company s portfolio of loans decreased $7.2 million, or 3.4%, to $202.0 million at January 31,
2006 from $209.2 million at October 31, 2005. Loans decreased in part as a result of a reduction
of $2.6 million, or 22.0%, in portfolio student loan outstandings, from $11.8 million at October
31, 2005 to $9.2 million at January 31, 2006. These particular student loans are to students who
have already graduated or left school and are past their deferment period. As a result, the Company
receives monthly payments and loan consolidation payoffs on these loans with no new originations.
The Company also experienced

- 10 -

Table of Contents   

declines in commercial and consumer real estate loans. Commercial loans (including real estate,
equipment and operating lines) declined $6.1 million, or 10.0%, to $55.1 million at January 31,
2006 from $61.2 million at October 31, 2005. The Company experienced increased paydowns on
commercial equipment and operating lines over what was replaced with new borrowers, as competition
has intensified and the operating line demands usually decline at this time of year. In addition
the Company experienced approximately $3.3 million in commercial loan payoffs to a competitor
institution that hired two of the Company s loan officers as a result of the possible change in
control of the Company. Consumer real estate loans declined $1.5 million, or 3.6%, from $42.0
million at October 31, 2005 to $40.5 million at January 31, 2006. The Company has seen a continued
slowdown in the local real estate markets which the Company believes to be as a result of rising
rates as well as what normally occurs during the winter season. Some of these declines were
partially offset by a $3.1 million, or 4.2%, increase in the Company s overall agricultural loan
portfolio to $76.2 million at January 31, 2006 from $73.1 million at October 31, 2005.

The Company s loans held for sale increased $11.5 million, or 81.0%, from $14.2 million at October
31, 2005 to $25.7 million at January 31, 2006. This increase was entirely in the students loans
originated for sale during this first fiscal quarter. The Company originates student loans for
several colleges and universities and once that particular academic school year loan is fully
disbursed, it is sold (usually around 60 days) on the secondary market at a premium of 1.55% to its
servicer, Nelnet, Inc.

Federal funds sold declined entirely to $0 from $8.7 million at October 31, 2005. Federal funds
sold and its counterpart, federal funds purchased, are used as the balancing account of the
Company s daily cash position and are generally short term (daily) in nature.

Total deposits decreased $24.6 million, or 4.8%, to $486.8 million at January 31, 2006 from $511.4
million at October 31, 2005. The majority of this decrease, $23.5 million, was in the Company s
interest-bearing demand and money market accounts($11.4 million) and time deposits of $100,000 and
over ($12.1 million) of nine of the Company s large municipal customers. Of this $23.5 million
decrease, $14.3 million was from eight of the Company s core municipal account relationships and
the other $9.2 million was from a municipal customer where the Company only maintains large
negotiated bid time deposits. These decreases are cyclical in nature based on when these municipal
customers receive their funding from the state and local taxing authorities. While these municipal
deposits are subject to large swings in balances, these type of accounts are usually done on a
multi-year bid basis (usually a minimum of at least three years, with automatically renewable
options) and the Company has demonstrated the ability to maintain these relationships over extended
periods of time. In addition, the Company had a change in the composition of its time deposits of
over and under $100,000. Time deposits of under $100,000, consisting mostly of retail consumer
certificates of deposit, increased $5.7 million, or 4.3%, to $137.1 million at January 31, 2006
from $131.4 million at October 31, 2005. The Company s time deposits of $100,000 or over decreased
$9.2 million, or 13.3%, to $60.1 million at January 31, 2006 from $69.3 million at October 31,
2005. The Company offered a retail consumer six month special certificate of deposit in
celebration of its new Rock Island Branch which opened in October 2005 as discussed in the
Company s Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2005. These certificates of deposit were
offered for only one week at a premium rate (5.00% APY) and total $13.2 million. The certificates
were funded from a combination of new deposits as well as funds that were on deposit at the Company
in different products. These time deposits will mature in May 2006 when the Company will decide
what rate may be offered for renewal based on funding needs at that time. Time deposits of
$100,000 or over are usually short term and subject to greater interest rate risk given the greater
frequency in repricing. The Company uses this product to assist our municipal clients with funds
that can be invested for time periods of generally one year or less. The Company does not solicit
funds from outside its own market area. Most customers from whom the Company does solicit funds
also have their core deposit accounts with Metrobank. The overall decrease in deposits was
primarily offset by the decrease in loans along with the decrease in the investment securities
portfolio during the three months ended January 31, 2006.

- 11 -

Table of Contents   

Short-term borrowings increased $7.8 million, or 166.0%, from $4.7 million at October 31, 2005 to
$12.5 million at January 31, 2006. The $8.0 million increase in overnight funds purchased, along
with the $8.7 million decrease in federal funds sold, were primarily used to fund the growth in the
student loans held for sale. Federal funds purchased and its counterpart, federal funds sold, are
used as the balancing account of the Company s daily cash position and are generally short term
(daily) in nature.

Stockholders  equity increased $533,100, or 1.4%, to $37.6 million at January 31, 2006 from $37.0
million at October 31, 2005. The increase in stockholders  equity was primarily due to net income
of $830,700 during the three months ended January 31, 2006. This net income was partly reduced by
an increase of $187,800 in the unrealized loss on securities available for sale in accordance with
SFAS 115 and dividends of $109,700 paid to shareholders.

Results of Operations 

The following discussion of the Company s results of operations should be read in conjunction with
the unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included at Part I Item 1 in
this report.

The Company s results of operations are primarily dependent on net interest income, non-interest
income, non-interest expense and income tax expense. Net interest income is the difference, or
spread, between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on
interest-bearing liabilities. The interest rate spread is affected by regulatory, economic, and
competitive factors that influence interest rates, loan demand, and deposit flows. The Company,
like other financial institutions, is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that its
interest-earning assets mature or reprice at different times, or on a different basis, than its
interest-bearing liabilities.

The Company s non-interest income is derived primarily from fees charged on transaction accounts,
which help offset the costs associated with establishing and maintaining these deposit accounts.
In addition, non-interest income is derived from ATM transaction fees, merchant, debit/credit card
fees along with gains on the sale of mortgage loans, student loans, and securities available for
sale. Additionally, non-interest income has been derived from the activities of Metrobank s trust
department, which provides a variety of professional trust services.

The Company s non-interest expense is derived primarily from salaries and employees benefits which
normally account from between 55% and 65 % of this total. In addition, other major categories are
occupancy and equipment expense along with merchant, debit/credit card expenses.

Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005 

General 

The Company recorded net income of $831,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2006, compared
to net income of $1,169,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2005. The decrease of $338,000,
or 28.9%, in net income primarily reflects a $588,000, or 15.0%, decrease in net interest income
which was somewhat offset by a negative $100,000 provision for loan losses, as discussed below
under  Provision for Loan Losses. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income for the three months ended January 31, 2006 decreased $588,000, or 15.0%,
to $3,344,000 compared to $3,932,000 for the period ended January 31, 2005. The decrease in net
interest income reflects an $873,000 increase in interest expense which was offset by a $285,000
increase in

interest income. Overall the net yield on average earning assets decreased .41% to 2.83% for the
period ended January 31, 2006 from 3.24% for the same period in 2005. The decrease in net yield on
average earning assets was due primarily to the rise in short term interest rates (225 basis points
rise in the federal funds rate) as the Company s rate on average funds increased .65% to 2.33% in
2006 from 1.68% in 2005. In addition there was a change in the composition of the balance sheet
during the year. The Company had an increase in the average securities available for sale
portfolio (overall lower yields, 4.40% for 2006) coupled with a reduction in loans outstanding,
which would normally be at higher yields (6.28% for 2006) when comparing an investment security to
a loan. Interest rates, particularly at the shorter end of the yield curve, started increasing
during the last half of 2004, continued throughout 2005 and into 2006 to date. The yield curve has
flattened significantly during the same period of time. These yields
are calculated on a fully tax equivalent basis.

Interest Income 

Interest income for the three months ended January 31, 2006 increased $285,000, or 4.6%, to
$6,445,000 from $6,160,000 for the same period in 2005. The increase was due primarily to an
increase of $196,000 in interest income from loans, which was the result of the average yield
increasing to 6.28% in the first fiscal quarter of 2006 compared to 5.67% in the first fiscal
quarter of 2005. This was offset by a decrease of $10,198,000 in average loans outstanding to
$222,188,000 in the first fiscal quarter of 2006 from $232,386,000 in the first fiscal quarter of
2005 and includes the averages of loans held for sale. Interest income on investments was up
$63,000, or 2.3%, in the first fiscal quarter of 2006 from $2,786,000 in the first fiscal quarter
of 2005 as average investments were up $2,302,000, or .8%, to $290,245,000 in the first fiscal
quarter of 2006 from $287,943,000 in the first fiscal quarter of 2005. The average yield on
investments increased .07% from 4.33% in the first fiscal quarter of 2005 to 4.40% in the first
fiscal quarter of 2006. These yields are calculated on a fully tax
equivalent basis.

The following table sets forth the weighted average tax equivalent effective interest rate on
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at the end of each of the periods
presented. Fees on loans are included in the calculation but are not material in nature.

Rate/Volume Analysis 

The following schedule presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest
expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. It
distinguishes between the changes in average outstanding balances and changes due to the levels and
volatility of interest rates. For

- 13 -

Table of Contents   

each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided
on changes attributable to changes in volume (i.e., changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and
changes in rate (i.e., changes in rate multiplied by old volume). For purposes of this table,
changes attributable to both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been allocated
proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate. Fees on loans are included
but not material in nature.

Average Balances, Interest Rates and Yields 

The following table presents for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of interest income
from average interest-earning assets and the resultant yields, as well as the interest expense on
average interest-bearing liabilities, expressed in both dollars and rates. No tax equivalent
adjustments have been made. Non-accruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a
zero yield. Fees on loans are included but are not material in nature.

Interest Expense 

Interest expense increased $873,000, or 39.2%, to $3,101,000 for the three months ended January 31,
2006 from $2,228,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2005. Interest expense on deposits
increased by $790,000, due primarily to an increase in the average rates paid on interest-bearing
deposits during the period to 2.41% for the first fiscal quarter of 2006 from 1.75% during the
first fiscal quarter of 2005. The average balance of non-interest bearing deposits increased by
$2,961,000 during the same period, which resulted in an overall increase of $1,557,000 in the
average balance of deposits. Interest expense on other borrowed funds increased $83,000 in the
first fiscal quarter of 2006 to $359,000 from $276,000 during the first fiscal quarter of 2005, due
to an increase in the average cost to 6.07% from 4.29%, which was partially offset by a decrease of
$2,069,000 in the average balance outstanding during the period.

Provision for Loan Losses 

Based on the Company s December 31, 2005 analysis of its loan loss reserve there was a negative
provision of $100,000 during the three months ended January 31, 2006 compared to no adjustments for
the three months ended January 31, 2005. One of the major factors was a decline of $7.2 million in
the balance on loans outstanding at January 31, 2006 compared to October 31, 2005. Management
believes that, based on a detailed review of the loan portfolio, historic loan losses, current
economic conditions,

- 15 -

Table of Contents   

lack of growth in the loan portfolio, and other factors, the current level of provision for loan
losses, and the resulting level of the allowance for loan losses, reflects an adequate allowance
against probable losses from the loan portfolio at such date.

Economic conditions in the agricultural sector of the Company s market areas are currently strong
and stable. In 2005, below average yields were offset somewhat by crop insurance proceeds and
increased government farm support programs. The agricultural economy is accustomed to production
and price fluctuations and is generally able to adjust to such fluctuations without significant
problems. Higher petroleum prices had some dampening effect on 2005 profits and could cause more
of a negative impact on profits in 2006 and beyond due to price increases in chemicals used in
agricultural production. Increased interest rates will also be a negative factor for the
agricultural sector. Should there be an extended period of low commodity prices or yields, or a
significant change in the government farm support programs, the Company s agricultural loan
portfolio could weaken and create a need for the Company to increase its allowance for loan losses
through increased charges to provision for loan losses.

Furthermore, although the Company maintains its allowance for loan losses at a level that it
considers to be adequate, investors and others are cautioned that there can be no assurance that
future losses will not exceed estimated amounts, or that additional provisions for loan losses will
not be required in future periods. In addition, the Company s determination of the allowance for
loan losses is subject to review by its regulatory agencies, which can require the establishment of
additional general or specific allowances.

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income decreased $52,000, or 4.4%, to $1,121,000 for the three months ended January 31,
2006 from $1,173,000 for the same period in 2005. The decrease was primarily in the areas of gains
on the sale of loans ($10,000), securities gains ($32,000), and ATM foreign transaction fees
($23,000). These reductions were partially offset by an overall increase in service charges on
deposit accounts of $15,000, on the strength of an increase of $31,000 in overdraft fees. As
competition has dictated, free checking is now the norm for retail checking accounts and as a
result the Company showed a reduction of $16,000 in the monthly service charges on checking
accounts. The Company has experienced a significant migration of current customers changing their
account over from a minimum balance regular checking account to the free checking as well as
smaller balance interest-bearing checking accounts to avoid any service charges. To a lesser
extent there has been a reduction in commercial checking service charges as the earnings credit
that a commercial checking customer receives to offset transaction charges has risen over the
course of the last year. It is indexed to the 91 day Treasury bill auction on a monthly basis.
Gains on the sale of loans decreased in both the real estate secondary market lending area as well
as in student loan gains. The decrease in real estate gains is as a result of the rise in interest
rates slowing down not only the mortgage-refinancing market but new originations as well.

Noninterest Expense 

Noninterest expense had a small increase of $3,000, or 0.1%, to $3,630,000 for the three months
ended January 31, 2006 from $3,627,000 for the same period in 2005. The increase in noninterest
expense primarily reflects a $30,000 increase in occupancy and equipment expenses along with a
$61,000 increase in merchant, debit/credit card fees. The increase in occupancy expenses was as a
result of a $10,000 increase in the heating cost from period-to-period and a $21,000 increase in
building and grounds maintenance and repair as the Company contracted for some landscaping and
general sprucing up at several of its locations. In the merchant, debit/credit card fees, there is
an increase of $29,000 for direct advertising of the Company s new  Choices  credit card which was
launched in fiscal year 2005. The remaining increase of $32,000 is in conjunction with the
increased volume of transactions in both the debit and credit card processing. As an offset to
these increases the Company s salaries and employee benefits decreased $105,000, or 4.8%, from
$2,194,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2005 to

- 16 -

Table of Contents   

$2,089,000 for the same period in 2006. The Company had a reduction in overall workforce, which
resulted in direct salary expense being reduced by $45,000. In addition there was a net reduction
of $40,000 as a result of the ESOP Plan being terminated in November of 2004 (a $54,000 reduction)
offset by the Company-sponsored 401(k) match program which started in January 2006 (a $14,000
increase).

Income Tax Expense 

For the three months ended January 31, 2006 the Company recorded income tax expense of $104,000
which was $205,000, or 66.3%, less than the $309,000 recorded for the three months ended January
31, 2005. The decrease in income taxes is reflective of the change in operating results between
the comparable periods and the incidence of allowable deductions,
particularly from tax-exempt loans and state and municipal securities.

Asset Quality 

It is management s belief, based on information available at the fiscal period ending January 31,
2006, that the Company s current asset quality is satisfactory. At January 31, 2006,
non-performing assets, consisting of non-accruing loans, accruing loans past due 90 days or more,
restructured loans, foreclosed real estate, and other repossessed property, totaled $1,506,000, or
..27% of total assets, compared to $2,497,000, or .43% of total assets for the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2005.

The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses because of the potential that some loans may not
be repaid in full. At January 31, 2006, the Company had an allowance for loan losses of $2,422,000
as compared to $2,519,000 at October 31, 2005. Management s periodic review of the adequacy of the
allowance for loan losses is based on various subjective and objective factors including the
Company s past loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that
may affect the borrower s ability to repay, the estimated value on any underlying collateral, and
current economic conditions. While management may allocate portions of the allowance for
specifically identified problem loan situations, the majority of the allowance is based on
judgmental factors related to the overall portfolio and is available for any loan charge-offs that
may occur.

In determining the allowance for loan losses, the Company specifically identifies loans that it
believes to have potential problems in collecting the entire balance owed. Based on criteria
established by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 114, some of these loans are
considered to be  impaired  while others are not considered to be impaired, but possess weaknesses
that the Company believes merit additional analysis in establishing the allowance for loan losses.
All other loans are evaluated by applying estimated loss ratios to various pools of loans. The
Company then analyzes other factors (such as economic conditions) in determining the aggregate
amount of the allowance needed.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company s primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, principal and interest payments on
loans and mortgage-backed securities, and maturing investment securities. While scheduled loan
repayments and maturing investments are relatively predictable, deposit flows and early loan
repayments are influenced by the level of interest rates, general economic conditions, and
competition.

The Company relies on competitive pricing policies, advertising and customer service to attract and
retain its deposits and only solicits these deposits from its primary market areas. Based on its
experience, the Company believes that its savings, money market demand deposits, interest-bearing
and regular checking accounts are relatively stable sources of funds. The Company s ability to
attract and retain time deposits has been, and will continue to be, significantly affected by
market conditions. However, the Company does not foresee significant funding issues resulting from
a disintermediation of its portfolio of time deposits.

Table of Contents   

The Company is required by regulation to maintain sufficient liquidity to assure its safe and sound
operation. In the opinion of management the Company is in compliance with this requirement.

Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of the Company s management strategy.
The Company adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon management s assessment of (i)
expected loan demand, (ii) expected deposit flows, (iii) yields available on interest-bearing
deposits, and (iv) the objectives of its assets/liability management program. Excess liquidity is
generally invested in overnight funds sold to one of its correspondent banks. If the Company
requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally or from overnight funds purchased, it
has additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB (Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago) and has
collateral eligible for its use with overnight repurchase agreements. The Company is not aware of
any significant adverse trends in the Company s liquidity or its ability to borrow additional funds
if needed.

The primary investing activities of the Company are the origination of loans and the purchase of
securities. During the three months ended January 31, 2006 the Company had a net decrease in loans
outstandings of $7.2 million. Some of the factors causing this decline are as follows: (i) with
the rising interest rate environment the Company experienced declines in consumer real estate loans
along with the normal slowdown during the winter season; (ii) significant declines in commercial
real estate loans, equipment and operating as the Company lost approximately $3.3 million in loans
to a competitor institution as the result of the departure of two commercial loan officers; and
(iii) declines in student loan outstandings as in 2002 the Company discontinued retaining new
student loan originations and began selling them in the secondary market sixty days after they are
fully disbursed. During the three months ended January 31, 2006 the Company purchased securities
available for sale in the amount of $8.9 million which was more than offset by $20.9 million in
maturities and calls during this same period. Loans held for sale increased $11.5 million to $25.7
million at January 31, 2006 from $14.2 million at October 31, 2005 which are anticipated to be sold
primarily in the months of April and May 2006. These are predominantly students loans and follow
the academic school calendar as far as volume.

At January 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005 the Company had outstanding loan commitments of $341,000
and $1,269,000, respectively. Certificates of deposits scheduled to mature in one year or less at
January 31, 2006 totaled $155.9 million. Management believes that loan repayment and other sources
of funds will be adequate to meet the Company s foreseeable short and long-term liquidity needs.

The following table summarizes the Company s significant contractual obligations at January 31,
2006 (in thousands):

On November 1, 2001, the Company s unconsolidated trust subsidiary, Metrocorp Capital Trust I, sold
$10 million in floating rate cumulative preferred securities. Proceeds from the sale were used to
purchase subordinated debentures of Metrocorp, which mature in the year 2031; however, the Company
has the option to redeem them at any time after November 2006 with prior regulatory approval. The
Company used the proceeds in the purchase of two banks (merged into Metrobank) and Community
Insurance.

The Company and Metrobank are in compliance with their capital requirements and are considered
 well capitalized  under current regulatory guidelines. The Company does not anticipate any
significant

- 18 -

Table of Contents   

changes to its capital structure. The following table summarizes the regulatory capital ratios for
the periods indicated:

In November 2004, the Company announced that the Board of Directors had passed a resolution
terminating the Company s Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) which covered substantially all
employees of the bank. The effect of this termination was that the shares of Metrocorp stock were
distributed to the employees in May 2005. The ESOP provided that any participant or beneficiary
who received a distribution of Metrocorp stock from the ESOP had the right to require the Company
to purchase such shares at their fair market value any time within 60 days of the distribution
date. If this initial put was not exercised, an additional 60-day exercise period becomes
available in May 2006 and begins after a new valuation of the stock has been determined and
communicated to the participant or beneficiary. The effect of this termination was that during the
period of May to July 2005 there were 178,209 shares  put  back to the Company at a price of $38.20
per share (which was the price established by an independent outside appraisal) for a total
repurchase of $6,807,584. The value of the remaining shares (144,421) that still have their second
 put  option have been classified as mezzanine capital and as such have already been subtracted
from the Company s capital as if they had been redeemed.

The payment of dividends and repurchase of shares has the effect of reducing stockholders  equity.
Prior to authorizing such transactions, the Board of Directors considers the effect the dividend or
repurchase of shares would have on liquidity and capital ratios. Metrobank and the Company may
declare dividends if certain tolerance limits are observed and which include, in the case of
Metrobank, consideration of certain statutory and regulatory restrictions.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 

The unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included at Part I Item 1 in
this report have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles,
which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical
dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to
inflation. The primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the Company s
operations. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the
Company are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant
impact on a financial institution s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation.
Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction, or to the same extent, as the prices
of goods and services.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

The Company s income is dependent to a large degree on its net interest income. Net interest
income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the degree that interest-bearing liabilities mature
or reprice at a different time than interest-earning assets and to the degree that market interest
rates change over that time. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than
interest-earning assets in a given period, a significant increase in market interest rates could
adversely affect net interest income. Conversely, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice
more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could result in a decrease
in net interest income. This risk is known as interest rate risk and it is the Company s primary
market risk.

The Company currently focuses lending efforts toward originating and purchasing competitively
priced adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loan products with short to intermediate terms to maturity,
generally 5 years or less. This theoretically allows the Company to maintain a portfolio of loans
that will have relatively little sensitivity to changes in the level of interest rates while
providing a reasonable spread to the cost of liabilities used to fund the loans.

One objective of the Company s investment portfolio is to provide the liquidity necessary to meet
the funding needs of the loan portfolio. The investment portfolio is also used in the ongoing
management of changes to the Company s asset/liability mix, while contributing to profitability
through earnings flow. The investment policy generally calls for funds to be invested among
various categories of security types and maturities based upon the Company s needs for liquidity,
achieving a proper balance between minimizing risk while maximizing yield, providing collateral for
borrowings, and fulfilling the Company s asset/liability management goals.

The Company s cost of funds responds to changes in interest rates due to the relatively short-term
nature of its deposit portfolio, and due to the relatively short-term nature of a portion of its
borrowed funds. Consequently, the results of operations are generally influenced by the level of
short-term interest rates. The Company offers a range of maturities on its deposit products at
competitive rates and monitors the maturities on an ongoing basis. The Company uses borrowed funds
for both the purchase of investment securities and for day-to-day cash management.

The Company emphasizes and promotes its savings, money market, demand and interest-bearing demand
accounts and, subject to market conditions, certificates of deposit with maturities of three months
through five years, principally in its primary market area. The savings and interest-bearing
demand accounts tend to be less susceptible to rapid changes in interest rates.

In managing its asset/liability mix, the Company, at times, depending on the relationship between
long-term and short-term interest rates, market conditions, and consumer preference, may place
somewhat greater emphasis on maximizing its net interest margin than on strictly matching the
interest rate sensitivity of its assets and liabilities. Management believes the increased net
income that may result from an acceptable mismatch in the actual maturity or repricing of its asset
and liability portfolios can, at times, provide sufficient returns to justify the increased
exposure to sudden and unexpected increases in interest rates that may result from such a mismatch.
The Company has established limits, which may change from time to time, on the level of acceptable
interest rate risk. There can be no assurance, however, that in the event of an adverse change in
interest rates, the Company s efforts to limit interest rate risk will be successful.

The Company manages its interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate balance between interest
sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities to reduce interest rate risk exposure while
also providing liquidity to satisfy the cash flow requirements of operations and to meet customers 
fluctuating demands for funds, in terms of loan requests and deposit withdrawals. The Company s
asset/liability risk policy

- 20 -

Table of Contents   

sets the necessary guidelines for managing the volume and mix of assets
and other funding sources. In addition, the Company has established a system for monitoring its
net interest rate sensitivity position.

Interest rate risk is managed by the Company s Rate Committee (Committee), which performs
asset/liability management at Metrobank s level in accordance with policies approved by the
Company s Board of Directors. The Committee is comprised of the Bank s President, Controller,
Senior Lender, Cashier, Trust Officer, Retail Manager and Marketing Officer. The Committee
formulates strategies based on what they believe to be appropriate levels of interest rate risk.
In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, the Committee considers the impact on
earnings, capital levels and general economic conditions.

The Company uses a net interest income simulation model to estimate near-term risk due to changes
in interest rates. The model, which is updated quarterly, incorporates substantially all assets and
liabilities together with forecasted changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the
current interest rate environment. Balance sheet changes are based on expected prepayments of
loans and securities. The Committee uses the model to simulate the effect of immediate and
sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve of 100 and 200 basis points. The results from the
simulation are normally reviewed by the Committee quarterly and are used to guide the Committee s
asset/liability strategy. Asset/liability risk guidelines approved by the Company s Board of
Directors generally limit the estimated decline in net interest income over the succeeding 12
months. In the event the forecasted decline exceeds 25% of the forecasted net interest income
given a 200 basis points change in interest rates, the Board will increase its scrutiny and may
change its strategy, if necessary. As of December 31, 2005, the
latest date for which information is available, the estimated effect of an immediate
200 basis point increase in rates was a decrease in forecasted net interest income for 12 months of
10.31%. The estimated effect of an immediate 200 basis point decrease in rates was an increase in
forecasted net interest income for 12 months of 4.71%.

The Committee has attempted to manage the Company s interest rate risk given that there has been an
increasing rate environment for more than one year. Since June 2004, the Federal Open Market
Committee began increasing short-term interest rates in twenty-five (25) basis point increments, to
a more normal level, from historically low levels. Through February 1, 2006, there have been
fourteen (14) such increases. As this happened, longer term rates moderated creating a flattening
in the yield curve. This action is indicative of limited concern about long-term inflation at this
time. While management does not anticipate a significant shift in market interest rates in the near
future, it does believe that there is less risk from declining interest rates than from rising
interest rates, and interest rate risk management has reflected this belief.

Interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are those which have yields or rates which
are subject to change within a future time period due to maturity of the instrument or changes in
the rate environment.  GAP  refers to the difference between interest-earning assets and
interest-bearing liabilities repricing within given time frames. As a result, major fluctuations
in net interest income and net earnings could occur due to imbalances between the amounts of
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as different repricing
characteristics. GAP management seeks to protect earnings by maintaining an appropriate balance
between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities in order to minimize fluctuations
in the net interest margin and net earnings in periods of volatile interest rates.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Metrocorp s principal executive officer, Gary D. Andersen, and principal financial officer, John R.
McEvoy, Jr., evaluated the effectiveness of Metrocorp s disclosure controls and procedures as of
January 31, 2006 ( Evaluation Date ). Based on that evaluation, they concluded that as of the
Evaluation Date, Metrocorp s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to allow timely
communication to

- 21 -

Table of Contents   

them of information relating to Metrocorp and Metrobank required to be disclosed
in its filings with the Commission under the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures are
Company controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.

There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

Metrocorp and Metrobank are periodically party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings
arising in the normal course of business, such as claims to enforce liens, claims involving the
making and servicing of real property loans, and other issues incident to the banking business.
Management does not believe that there is any pending or threatened proceeding which, if determined
adversely, would have a material effect on Metrocorp s or Metrobank s business, results of
operations or financial condition.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

There have been no material changes from the risk factors as previously disclosed in the Company s

SECTION 1. Indemnification. The Corporation shall indemnify all persons made parties to any
action, suit or proceeding, civil or criminal, by reason of the fact that they are or were either
Directors, officers or employees of the Corporation or of any corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise which they served in such capacities at the request of the
Corporation. Such persons shall be indemnified against judgments, fines, and other liabilities
(including amounts paid in settlement) sustained as a result of, and reasonable expenses (including
attorneys  fees) incurred in connection with, the defense or the compromise or settlement of any
such action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with the appeal thereof, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article.

SECTION 2. Limitations. An indemnification under this Article shall be limited under the
following circumstances:

- 6 -

(i) In the event of a final adjudication of such action, suit or proceeding, such person shall
not be indemnified with respect to any matter as to which they have been adjudged liable for gross
negligence or knowing and intentional misconduct in the performance of their duties to the
Corporation.

(ii) In the event that such action, suit or proceeding is compromised or settled before final
adjudication thereof, such persons shall not be indemnified unless there shall be a Qualified
Determination that they acted without gross negligence and that their actions did not constitute
knowing and intentional misconduct in the performance of their duties to the Corporation.

(iii) Such persons shall not be indemnified for any amounts incurred in any administrative
proceeding or action instituted by an appropriate Corporation regulatory agency which resulted in a
final order assessing civil money penalties or requiring affirmative action by such person or
persons in the form of payments to the Corporation, or whenever such indemnification is otherwise
prohibited by the general corporate laws of the State of Illinois, appropriate Corporation
regulatory agency regulations, or other applicable law.

SECTION 3. Exception. A judgment or conviction in a criminal action, suit or proceeding or
termination of such proceeding by a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not be deemed
an adjudication that the Director, officer, or employee is liable for gross negligence or knowing
and intentional misconduct in the performance of their duties to the Corporation if there is a
Qualified Determination that the action complained of on the part of the Director, officer, or
employee was taken in good faith in what they considered to be in the best interests of the
Corporation and on the reasonable assumption of its legality.

SECTION 4. Expense Advances. Expenses incurred by persons who may have a right of
indemnification under this Article in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may
be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding,
if authorized in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors by a majority vote, upon receipt of
a written undertaking on behalf of such persons to repay such amounts, unless it is ultimately
determined that they are entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation pursuant to a Qualified
Determination.

SECTION 5. Qualified Determination Defined. As used in this Article, the words  Qualified
Determination  means that the matter in question shall be determined either:

(i) by a court order, or

(ii) by a majority vote of the Directors who are not parties to such action, suit or
proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or

(iii) if there are no such Directors or if such disinterested Directors so direct, by
independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or

(iv) by vote of the majority of the stockholders.

SECTION 6. Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any
persons who are or were Directors, officers, or employees of the Corporation or are or were serving
at the request of the Corporation as a Director, officer, or employee of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against such
persons and incurred by them in any such capacity or arising out of their status as such, whether
or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify them against such liability under the
provisions of this Article or applicable state or federal laws.

- 7 -

SECTION 7. Unimpaired Rights. The foregoing rights of indemnification shall not be exclusive
of any other rights which any Director, officer, or employee may have as a matter of law. The
foregoing rights of indemnification shall, in the case of the death of a Director, officer, or
employee inure to the benefit of the decedent s estate.

ARTICLE VII

either the Secretary or an additional Vice President, and shall bear the corporate seal. Transfers
of stock shall be made only on the books of the Corporation either by the holder in person or by
duly authorized attorney; and the possession of a certificate of stock shall not be regarded as
vesting any ownership of the same in any other than the person in whose name it is issued (as
between the Corporation and such other holder) until the transfer is duly made on the books of the
Corporation, as aforesaid. The Secretary, or in the Secretary s absence any officer designated by
the President, shall see that proper certificates showing the transfers of the Capital Stock of the
Corporation, as they are made on the books of the Corporation, are executed and filed as required

SECTION 3. Lost Certificates. If any person requests that a certificate of stock of the
Corporation be issued in place of one lost or destroyed, the person shall make an affidavit of the
fact, and in it state the circumstances of the loss or destruction of said certificate, and the
person shall transmit to the Corporation an affidavit, and shall give to the Corporation and to the
