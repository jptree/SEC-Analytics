1. Basis of Presentation and Description of Business

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying  unaudited interim financial  statements of Harvey Electronics,
Inc. (the "Company") have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally  accepted  in the  United  States of  America  for  interim  financial
reporting  and with the  instructions  to Form  10-Q.  Accordingly,  they do not
include all of the  information  and  footnotes  required by generally  accepted
accounting  principles  for  complete  financial  statements.  In the opinion of
Management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered
necessary for a fair presentation have been included.

Operating  results for the thirteen  week period ended  January 28, 2006 are not
necessarily  indicative  of the results that may be expected  for the  fifty-two
weeks ending October 28, 2006. Net sales and operating results for the Company's
first quarter of its fiscal year are positively affected by the holiday shopping
season. For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes
thereto  included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
October 29, 2005.

The preparation of the unaudited interim financial statements in conformity with
accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in the  United  States  of  America
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported
amounts of assets and  liabilities  and  disclosures  at the date of the interim
financial  statements and the reported  amounts of revenues and expenses  during
the reporting  period.  Management  bases its estimates on certain  assumptions,
which they believe are  reasonable  in the  circumstances,  and does not believe
that any  change in those  assumptions  would have a  significant  effect on the
financial  position or results of  operations.  Actual results could differ from
those estimates and assumptions.

Additionally,  certain  items in the Unaudited  Statement of Operations  for the
thirteen weeks ended January 29, 2005 have been  reclassified  to conform to the
2006 presentation.

Description of Business

The  Company is a  specialty  retailer  and  custom  installer  of high  quality
audio/video  consumer  electronics and home theater products in the Metropolitan
New York area.  Operations of the Company consist solely of this single segment.
The Company's fiscal year ends the Saturday closest to October 31.

Net  sales  include  the sale of  goods to  customers  and  custom  installation
revenue.  Retail  sales are  recorded  at the time of the sale to the  customer.
Custom installation revenue, which is comprised of both the sale of products and
the labor in connection with the  installation of the products,  are recorded in
accordance  with  the  provisions  of EITF  00-21,  "Revenue  Arrangements  with
Multiple  Deliverables".  The  revenue  related to the sale of the  products  is
recognized  when the product is delivered to the customers.  The revenue related
to the labor in connection with the  installation  of the products,  is recorded
when the service has been substantially  completed.  If the custom  installation
project requires a pre-wire phase,  this phase will be considered a separate and
distinct  stage of  work.  The  customer  agrees  to take  title of wire and any
in-wall speakers when delivered to the site as they have fair value.

Harvey Electronics, Inc.
                          Notes to Financial Statements
                                January 28, 2006
                                   (Unaudited)

The  customer  agrees  that these  amounts  paid in advance  for wire or in-wall
speakers delivered to the site are non-refundable and as a result, these amounts
are  recognized  as  revenue  when  delivered.  Labor on the  pre-wire  phase is
recognized as revenue when the pre-wire installation is substantially completed.
Revenues  relating to these  elements are recorded based on their fair values in
the market.

In addition,  the Company sells  extended  warranty  contracts for a third party
provider.  The profit on extended warranty sales is considered commission at the
time of sale. The net amount earned on these sales is recorded in net sales,  in
accordance with EITF 99-19,  "Reporting  Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net
as an Agent."

Major components of selling general and administrative  expenses include payroll
related expenses, net advertising expense,  occupancy costs,  professional fees,
truck  expenses,   warehouse  costs,   distribution  costs,  insurance  expense,
depreciation expense and credit card fees. Cost of goods sold includes inventory
shrink,  purchase  discounts from its vendors and freight  costs.  The Company's
computation  of cost of goods  sold and gross  profit may not be  comparable  to
other  reporting  electronics  retailers as other entities may include the costs
relating to warehousing and distribution networks.

2. Revolving Line of Credit Facility

In November 2003,  the Company  entered into a new five-year $7.5 million credit
facility with Webster Business Credit Corporation  ("Webster"),  a subsidiary of
Connecticut  based Webster Bank. This new credit  facility  replaced the line of
credit facility with Wells Fargo Retail Finance ("Wells  Fargo").  Under the new
credit  facility,  the Company can borrow up to $7.5 million  based upon lending
formulas  calculated on eligible  credit card  receivables  and inventory,  less
certain reserves,  as defined.  The Webster credit facility expires November 21,
2008.

The interest rate on all  borrowings  under the credit  facility is either 0.25%
over Webster  Bank's prime rate (7.25% at January 28, 2006) or LIBOR plus 2.75%,
at the Company's  option.  The Company paid Webster a $25,000  commitment fee in
two equal  installments of $12,500,  on November 21, 2003 and November 21, 2004,
respectively.  Under the credit  facility,  the Company  pays  Webster a reduced
maintenance fee of $1,000 per month and a monthly unused line fee, as defined in
the credit  facility.  Simultaneously,  with the closing of the  Webster  credit
facility,  the  Company  paid  all  outstanding  amounts  due  to  Wells  Fargo,
aggregating  $2,504,000,  and Wells  Fargo's  senior  security  interest  in the
Company's assets was terminated.

In connection  with the credit  facility,  the Company  granted Webster a senior
security interest in all of the Company's  assets.  The credit facility provides
Webster with rights of  acceleration  upon the  occurrence of certain  customary
events of default. The Company is restricted from paying dividends on its Common
Stock,  retiring or  repurchasing  its Common Stock and entering into additional
indebtedness (as defined).

                                   (Unaudited)

2. Revolving Line of Credit Facility (Continued)

Pursuant to the new credit  facility,  the Company cannot exceed certain advance
rates on eligible  inventory  and must  maintain  certain  monthly and quarterly
levels  of  earnings  before  interest,  taxes,  depreciation  and  amortization
("EBITDA").  Additionally,  the Company's  annual  capital  expenditures  cannot
exceed a  predetermined  amount.  In September  2005, the Company entered into a
First Amendment and Waiver Agreement ("First Amendment") with Webster. The First
Amendment waived any covenant  defaults existing at the end of the third quarter
of fiscal 2005 and modified the EBITDA and capital  expenditures  covenants  for
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. On January 20, 2006, the Company entered into
a Second  Amendment  ("Second  Amendment")  with Webster.  The Second  Amendment
modified the EBITDA and capital expenditures  covenants for the first quarter of
fiscal 2006. In February 2006, the Company  entered into a Third  Amendment with
Webster, which further modified the EBITDA covenant,  effective at the beginning
of the  Company's  second  quarter.  As of January 28, 2006,  the Company was in
compliance with all covenants.

As the  credit  facility  expires  in three  years and does not  include  both a
subjective  acceleration  clause and a lock box arrangement,  in accordance with
EITF 95-22, the Company classified the balance outstanding,  at January 28, 2006
($2,327,000) and October 29, 2005  ($3,486,000),  under the credit facility as a
long-term liability.

3. Net Advertising Expense

In  accordance   with  EITF  02-16,   "Accounting  by  a  Customer  for  Certain
Consideration  Received from a Vendor"  ("EITF  02-16") which  addresses how and
when  to  reflect  consideration   received  from  suppliers  in  the  financial
statements,  the Company's  advertising expense, net of cooperative  advertising
allowances,  is charged to  operations  when the  advertising  takes place.  Net
advertising expense is included in Selling,  general and administrative expenses
in the Company's Statements of Operations.

Manufacturer rebates received by the Company are recorded based on the quarterly
estimated progress in earning such rebates. The Company's  estimates,  to record
these rebates are based on historical information and current programs with such
vendors.

The  following  represents  the  gross  amounts  of  advertising   expenditures,
cooperative  advertising  reimbursements  and net  advertising  expense  for the
periods reported:

4. Income Per Share

Basic and diluted  earnings per share are calculated in accordance with SFAS No.
128,  "Earnings Per Share" ("SFAS No. 128").  Basic  earnings per share excludes
the  dilutive  effects of  options  and  convertible  preferred  stock.  Diluted
earnings  per  share  includes  only  the  dilutive   effects  of  common  stock
equivalents such as stock options and convertible preferred stock.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per
share for the periods presented pursuant to SFAS No. 128.

5. Income Taxes

In connection with the Company's  emergence from its  reorganization  proceeding
under Chapter 11 of the United States  Bankruptcy Code on December 26, 1996, the
Company  adopted Fresh Start  Accounting in accordance  with AICPA  Statement of
Position  90-7,  "Financial  Reporting by Entities in  Reorganization  under the
Bankruptcy  Code." Fresh Start  Accounting  requires that the Company  report an
income   tax   equivalent   provision   when   there  is  book   income   and  a
pre-reorganization  net operating loss  carryforward.  This requirement  applies
despite  the fact  that the  Company's  pre-reorganization  net  operating  loss
carryforward  will be  utilized to reduce the related  income tax  payable.  The
current  and  any  future  year  benefit   arising  from   utilization   of  the
pre-reorganization  carryforward  is not  reflected  as a  reduction  of the tax
equivalent provision in determining net income, but instead is recorded first as
a  reduction  of  reorganization   value  in  excess  of  amounts  allocable  to
identifiable  assets until  exhausted  and  thereafter  as a direct  addition to
paid-in-capital.

For the  thirteen  weeks  ended  January 28,  2006 and  January  29,  2005,  the
Company's income tax provision  represents  deferred tax expense of $25,000 (36%
effective tax rate) and $180,000 (40%  effective tax rate),  respectively.  As a
result, the Company's long-term deferred tax asset was reduced by these amounts.
The income tax provisions will not require the use of the Company's cash.

6. Inventories

Inventories   have  been  valued  at  average  cost,  based  upon  gross  profit
percentages applied to sales.

Results of Operations

General

The  following  discussion  should  be read in  conjunction  with the  Company's
audited  financial  statements  for the fiscal years ended  October 29, 2005 and
October 30, 2004, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10K.

Thirteen  Weeks Ended  January  28,  2006 as  Compared  to Thirteen  Weeks Ended
January 29, 2005

Net Income.  The Company's  pre-tax  income for the thirteen weeks ended January
28, 2006  aggregated  $70,000 as compared to $454,000  for the same period ended
January 29, 2005. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 was $45,000 as
compared to $274,000 for the same period last year.

The Company  believes  the non-GAAP  measurement  of earnings  before  interest,
taxes,  depreciation  and  amortization  ("EBITDA") is an important  operational
measure.  Depreciation and amortization  have  historically  been significant in
relation to net income. The Company's  depreciation and amortization expense, as
does  interest  expense  from  its  line of  credit,  primarily  relates  to the
Company's retail stores and expansion of its retail stores. The Company's income
tax  equivalent  provisions  or deferred tax expense have also had a significant
impact on earnings,  but have  primarily  not required the use of the  Company's
cash, due to the reporting requirements of Fresh Start Accounting.

The  Company's  Management,  Board of Directors  and Webster  comparably  review
EBITDA  monthly,  quarterly  and  annually to gauge the  Company's  performance.
EBITDA may also be used in simple  valuation  measures  of the  Company,  by its
shareholders  and potential  investors.  Management  understands  that there are
limitations  associated  with the use of this  non-GAAP  measure  of  EBITDA  as
compared to net income.  Specifically, a portion of interest expense does relate
to the Company's operations and a portion of the income tax equivalent provision
does relate to the payment of certain  state taxes,  although  these amounts are
not material.  Additionally,  the Company will not eliminate any other recurring
or non-recurring  expenses in its  reconciliation of the Company's net income to
EBITDA.

The Company's net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 was reduced by net
advertising  expense of $160,000 as  compared to $325,000  for the same  quarter
last year. The Company's  advertising presence decreased in the first quarter of
fiscal 2006, as advertising expenditures decreased to $730,000 from $965,000 for
the same period last year.

Additionally,  as the Company's  overall sales declined for the first quarter of
fiscal  2006,  from the  same  period  last  year,  the  Company  realized  less
cooperative advertising support from its vendors.

The Company's pre-tax income for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 was negatively
impacted by reduced  comparable  store sales as  discussed  below,  as well as a
reduction in the gross profit margin from  competitive  pressure and promotional
advertising in this quarter.

The Company  recorded income tax provisions for the thirteen weeks ended January
28, 2006 and January 29, 2005 of $25,000 (36%  effective  tax rate) and $180,000
(40%  effective  tax rate),  respectively.  The income tax  provisions  will not
materially affect the Company's tax liability or its use of cash.

Revenues.  Net sales for the first  quarter  ended  January 28, 2006 declined to
$11,385,000 or a 5.8% decrease from the same quarter last year. Comparable store
sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2006  decreased  approximately  10.9% from
the same period last year. The decrease in sales was due to a continued slowdown
in retail store  traffic,  a reduction of audio sales and flat panel  television
shortages from key vendors, making it difficult to fulfill customer orders.

Despite  these  flat panel  shortages  and  continued  video  price  compression
experienced in the industry,  the Company's video business  remained  relatively
flat with the same quarter  last year.  Demand for flat panel  televisions  have
continued to be strong and unit sales have  increased  approximately  37% in the
first  quarter of fiscal 2006 as  compared  to the same  period  last year.  The
Company  has  experienced  flat  panel  growth in  larger  size  plasma  and LCD
televisions while reporting declines in smaller units. Sales of larger size flat
panel televisions have provided installation  opportunities for the Company. The
Company's  labor  revenue  ($1  million)   remained  strong  and  accounted  for
approximately 9% of gross sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared
to labor revenue ($1.1 million) accounting for 9.3% of gross sales from the same
quarter last year.

Net Income (continued)
The Company's  overall video sales ($5.2 million) have been negatively  impacted
by price  compression  in the industry as well as  competitive  pressures in the
market.  Management  believes  this trend will continue but not at the same rate
which was  experienced  in fiscal  2005 and  earlier  in fiscal  2006.  As video
products  are  affected  by  price  compression,  Management  believes  it is an
opportunity for the Company to attach additional higher margin audio components,
accessories  and labor.  Video sales  represented  approximately  44.7% of gross
sales for the first  quarter of fiscal  2006,  from 42.3% of gross sales for the
same quarter last year.

The Company's  higher margin audio sales ($5.3  million) have decreased to 46.2%
of gross  sales for the first  quarter of fiscal  2006 from 48.4% of gross sales
for the same quarter last year. Audio sales were negatively  impacted by reduced
audio  components,  systems and audio  accessories.  The Company's higher margin
furniture,  cable, wire and surge protector sales continued to increase, despite
the overall reduction in sales.

The Company  believes it  continues  to benefit  from the strong  demand for its
custom installation services. Additionally,  despite increased competition and a
decline in retail  store  traffic,  customer  demand  continues to be strong for
digital video  products  including  larger  plasma flat screen,  LCD flat panel,
high-definition televisions,  integrated remote controls and related custom home
installations.   Custom  installation   projects  continue  to  increase,  as  a
percentage  of gross sales and  accounted for 61.1% of gross sales for the first
quarter of fiscal 2006,  as compared to  approximately  58.4% of gross sales for
the same quarter last year. Overall custom  installation  sales,  including both
equipment sales and labor income remained strong and aggregated $7.1 million for
the first  quarter of fiscal  2006,  as  compared  to $7.2  million for the same
period last year. The Company's custom installation  services yield higher gross
profit  margins and stronger  net  profitability,  as compared to normal  retail
store sales.

The Company believes it differentiates  itself by offering  sophisticated custom
installation services,  including programming  capabilities that address complex
technological  integration  issues  giving its  customers  easy  remote  control
operations  for a variety of functions.  Management  believes  installations  of
dedicated  theater rooms,  hard drive video and audio storage and  distribution,
lighting  systems  in the home,  as well as network  cabling  will  continue  to
attract  affluent  customers to the  Company.  The home theater room will be the
forefront of the smart home,  for the desired  integration  of all  electronics,
lighting,  security  and  networking  within the home.  These  offerings  should
continue to benefit  sales,  enhance  gross  margins and improve  overall  store
profitability.

The Company  believes it can expand its service  niche in offering  custom labor
and  other  accessories  for both  Harvey  customers  and  customers  that  have
purchased  products  elsewhere,  specifically  on  the  internet  or  from  mass
merchants.  The Company is offering a forty-eight  hour response time to address
the needs of a qualified customer at an additional labor cost. Additionally, the
Company has  recently  announced a  partnership  with  Cablevision  offering and
installing  their high speed cable modems and digital cable boxes in conjunction
with our installation services to Cablevision's iO digital cable customers.  The
Company is also working with Time Warner in offering these services.

Net sales for the new Harvey  retail store  located in  Bridgewater,  New Jersey
have been encouraging.  The Company believes that this store will take some time
to mature as its sales have  significantly  come from new home  construction and
custom  installations  which  take  time  to  cultivate  and  complete.  The new
Bridgewater store is expected to contribute to net store profitability in fiscal
2006.

Net Income (continued)
In fiscal 2005, the Company  relocated and consolidated its Bang & Olufsen store
in Greenwich,  Connecticut with its Harvey Greenwich store, one block away. This
store-within-a-store  concept  presents Bang & Olufsen  products in a unique and
separate  showcase within a Harvey store.  The Company is excited about this new
store-within-a-store  concept and has been able to  increase  its Bang & Olufsen
sales without the overhead of a separate store.

Net sales for all of the Company's  retail stores  experienced  declines for the
first quarter of fiscal 2006, as compared to the same quarter last year,  except
the Company's Mt. Kisco, New York and Paramus,  New Jersey stores.  These stores
benefited  from strong  custom  installation  business  during the quarter.  The
Company's  first quarter net sales for its Bang & Olufsen store in New York City
remained relatively flat with the first quarter of fiscal 2005.

In September 2005, the Company  engaged a new advertising  agency to promote its
brand and increase awareness in the Company's service initiatives. The Company's
marketing  efforts  were in a  transition  stage in the first  quarter of fiscal
2006.  The new campaign is expected to be  introduced  in the  Company's  second
quarter.  In fiscal 2006, the Company's planned marketing  disbursements will be
redistributed  and its overall  expenditures  are  expected to decline  from the
total  expenditures  incurred in fiscal 2005.  These  efforts  will  continue to
include  radio,  newspaper,  direct mail and e-mail  broadcasts,  as well as the
continued promotion of the Company's website, www.harveyonline.com.  The Company
does expect to improve or replace its website in fiscal 2006.

For fiscal 2006,  the Company also will endeavor to put  additional  efforts and
resources into its important customer relations management initiatives and plans
to be more  aggressive  with  specific  e-mail  promotions  to  prospective  and
existing customers.

Cost and Expenses. Total cost of goods sold for the first quarter decreased 2.2%
to $6,834,000, as compared to the same quarter last year. The decline in cost of
goods sold was primarily due to the overall 5.8% decrease in net sales as noted
above, and was increased by the decline in the Company's gross profit margin for
the first quarter of fiscal 2006.

The gross  profit  margin for the first  quarter of fiscal 2006  declined to 40%
from 42.3% for the same  quarter  last  year.  The  decline in the gross  profit
margin was due to continued video price compression, reduced higher margin audio
sales,  and  additionally  from price  promotions  offered in December  2005 and
January  2006.  Additionally,  the  Company  experienced  an 8% decline in labor
revenue  during its first quarter of fiscal 2006 as well as a reduction of gross
margin on its labor  revenue from  additional  costs  associated  with its labor
force.  In the second  quarter of fiscal  2006,  the  Company has  modified  and
increased  its labor rates which should  improve labor margins for the remainder
of the year.

Additional higher margin furniture, cable, wire and surge protector sales helped
to mitigate the decline in the Company's overall gross profit margin.

The  Company's  total  cost of  goods  sold  includes  freight  costs,  purchase
discounts  from its vendors and inventory  shrink.  The  Company's  gross profit
margin may not be comparable to other reporting  electronics  retailers as other
entities may include the costs relating to their  warehousing  and  distribution
networks.  Warehouse  and  distribution  network  costs for the first quarter of
fiscal 2006 and 2005 approximated $170,000 and $200,000,  respectively,  and are
included in SG&A expenses.

Net Income (continued)
Selling,  general and administrative  expenses ("SG&A") for the first quarter of
fiscal 2006 decreased by approximately $194,000 or 4.2%, as compared to the same
quarter  last  year.  This  decrease  was  offset by  additional  SG&A  expenses
aggregating  $229,000,  relating to the  Company's new  Bridgewater,  New Jersey
store.

Net  advertising  expense,  which is included in SG&A  expenses in the Company's
Statements of  Operations,  declined to $160,000 for the first quarter of fiscal
2006 from  $325,000 for the same quarter last year.  This decrease was primarily
related to a reduction in advertising expenditures.  The Company also realized a
decline in  cooperative  advertising  support from its vendors  during the first
quarter of fiscal 2006, as compared to the first quarter in fiscal 2005.

SG&A expenses also declined from reduced payroll and payroll  related  expenses,
management bonuses and communications.  These decreases were offset by increased
depreciation  expense,  occupancy  costs,  supplies  and  credit  card fees from
promotions offering extended financing options.

As part of its ongoing  cost  reduction  program,  Management  will  continue to
examine  ways to reduce  expenses  further in fiscal  2006.  This  includes  the
negotiation  with its landlords for rent reductions or deferrals.  Additionally,
Management  will endeavor to improve its purchasing  and inventory  efficiencies
while implementing positive merchandising changes and cultivating its profitable
service offerings.

However,  the Company  plans to continue to hire and train  custom  installation
personnel,  as needed, and incur the necessary  associated  expenses relating to
the expansion of its custom  installation  services.  Management  believes these
services  differentiate  Harvey and are vital to the  Company's  business  plan.
Management  will also  intensify  its sales  training  efforts in fiscal 2006 to
ensure  that its  customers  are given an  exceptional  and  unsurpassed  retail
experience.

Interest  expense  increased  by  approximately  $32,000  or 71.3% in the  first
quarter of fiscal 2006 from the same period last year. This was primarily due to
increased   borrowings  and  higher  interest  rates.   The  Company's   balance
outstanding on its credit  facility had increased as the Company used the credit
facility to finance the construction of its new retail store in Bridgewater, New
Jersey,  in fiscal  2005.  Additionally,  the credit  facility  was used to fund
expenditures  for computer  equipment,  software  deposits and development  work
relating  to the  replacement  of its  legacy  computer  system  expected  to be
completed in fiscal 2006.

For the first quarter ended January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, the Company's
income tax provision  represents  deferred tax expense of $25,000 (36% effective
tax rate) and $180,000 (40%  effective tax rate),  respectively.  The income tax
provisions did not require the use of the Company's cash.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
At January 28, 2006 and October 29, 2005, the Company's  ratio of current assets
to current liabilities was 1.26 and 1.52, respectively.

The current ratio at January 28, 2006 was  positively  impacted by the Company's
pre-tax income and was negatively  impacted by an increase in customer  deposits
where  orders  could  not be  fulfilled  due to flat  panel  television  product
shortages.

Net cash provided by operating  activities  for the first quarter of fiscal 2006
increased  to  $1,396,000  from  $286,000  for the same period  last year.  This
increase was due to an increase in customer deposits as discussed above, coupled
with an increase in trade accounts payable and accrued  expenses.  Additionally,
the Company was  successful in reducing its  inventories in the first quarter of
fiscal  2006,  where in the first  quarter  of  fiscal  2005,  inventories  were
increased.

Net cash used in investing  activities for this first quarter of fiscal 2006 was
$197,000 as compared to $209,000 for the same period last year. Net cash used in
investing activities included the purchase of equipment and software aggregating
$86,000 and deposits on development  work  aggregating  $110,000  related to the
planned  replacement  of the Company's  legacy  computer  system.  For the first
quarter  of  fiscal  2005,  $209,000  was used  for the  purchase  of  leasehold
improvements and equipment.

Net cash used in financing  activities  for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 was
$1,198,000,  as compared to $76,000 for the same  quarter  last year.  Financing
activities for the first quarter  included net payments of $1,159,000,  reducing
the credit facility, preferred stock dividends of $25,000 and principal payments
on note  payables  of $14,000.  Financing  activities  for the first  quarter of
fiscal 2005  included  net payments of $36,000,  reducing  the credit  facility,
preferred  stock  dividends  paid of  $33,000  and  principal  payments  on note
payables of $7,000.

In November  2003,  the Company  entered into a five-year  $7.5  million  credit
facility with Webster Business Credit Corporation  ("Webster"),  a subsidiary of
Connecticut  based  Webster  Bank.  This  credit  facility  replaced  the credit
facility with Wells Fargo. Under the credit facility,  the Company can borrow up
to $7.5 million based upon lending  formulas  calculated on eligible credit card
receivables  and  inventory,  less  certain  reserves,  as  defined.  The credit
facility expires November 21, 2008.

The  interest  rate on all  borrowings  under the credit  facility is 0.25% over
Webster  Bank's prime rate (7.25% at January 28,  2006) or LIBOR plus 2.75%,  at
the Company's option.

In connection  with the credit  facility,  the Company  granted Webster a senior
security interest in all of the Company's  assets.  The credit facility provides
Webster with rights of  acceleration  upon the  occurrence of certain  customary
events of default. The Company is restricted from paying dividends on its Common
Stock,  retiring or  repurchasing  its Common Stock and entering into additional
indebtedness (as defined).

Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)
Pursuant to the credit facility, the Company cannot exceed certain advance rates
on eligible  inventory  and must  maintain  certain  levels of  earnings  before
interest,  taxes,  depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA").  Additionally,  the
Company's  capital  expenditures  cannot  exceed  a  predetermined   amount.  In
September 2005, the Company entered into a First Amendment and Waiver  Agreement
("First  Amendment")  with  Webster.  The First  Amendment  waived any  covenant
defaults  existing at the end of the third  quarter of fiscal 2005 and  modified
the EBITDA and capital  expenditures  covenants for the fourth quarter of fiscal
2005. On January 20, 2006, the Company entered into a Second Amendment  ("Second
Amendment") with Webster.  The Second Amendment  modified the EBITDA and capital
expenditures  covenants  for the first  quarter of fiscal 2006.  On February 17,
2006, the Company  entered into a Third  Amendment  with Webster,  which further
modified the EBITDA covenant, effective at the beginning of the Company's second
quarter.  As of  January  28,  2006,  the  company  was in  compliance  with all
covenants.

At March 13, 2006, there was approximately  $2,880,000 in outstanding borrowings
under the credit facility,  with  approximately  $1,723,000  available to borrow
under this credit facility.

The  Company  has  authorized  10,000  shares  of  8.5%  Cumulative  Convertible
Preferred Stock  ("Preferred  Stock") with a par value of $1,000 per share.  The
conversion  price of the Company's  preferred  stock is $1.2333.  At January 28,
2006,  600 shares of Preferred  Stock,  held by one  shareholder,  are currently
outstanding and convertible into 486,500 shares of Common Stock.

The Company's  newest 4,500 square foot Harvey retail  showroom in  Bridgewater,
New Jersey  opened in late June 2005. In fiscal 2005,  the Company  financed all
necessary leaseholds,  equipment, furniture, fixtures and inventory, aggregating
$1,560,000,  with its credit  facility.  In fiscal 2006, the Company  expects to
complete the  installation  of a full movie theater within its Long Island store
and make  miscellaneous  purchases  of  computer  equipment,  and other  assets,
approximating $150,000 to be financed using the Company's credit facility.

The  Company  plans to replace its  existing  computer  system in May 2006.  The
project  cost is  estimated  at $600,000 - $650,000.  At January 28,  2006,  the
remaining  costs to complete  the project are  estimated at $300,000 - $350,000.
These costs will be financed using the Company's credit facility in fiscal 2006.

The Company  intends to  introduce  its new  advertising  campaign in the second
quarter of fiscal  2006,  primarily  with print,  radio,  direct mail and e-mail
broadcasts. Advertising expenditures are expected to be reduced in fiscal 2006.

The  Company's  website gives its  customers  access to one of Harvey's  upscale
retail showrooms or offers its customers a private, in-home consultation through
the  convenience of the Internet.  The Company is expected to improve or replace
its website in fiscal 2006 at an estimated cost of between $75,000 - $100,000.

In fiscal  2004,  the Company  amended and  extended  the lease for its flagship
store in  Midtown  Manhattan.  This  lease  amendment  increased  the  Company's
occupancy costs in fiscal 2005 but will increase these costs to a greater extent
beginning  in  fiscal  2006.  The  increase  in rent  expense  for  this  store,
calculated  on a  straight-line  basis,  beginning in fiscal 2006 is expected to
approximate $200,000 per year.

In July 2003,  the Company  received a notice and  information  request from the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection ("PADEP"). See Part I, Legal
Proceedings and the notes to the Company's financial statements,  for details on
this matter.

The  Securities and Exchange  Commission  has extended the compliance  dates for
non-accelerated  filers,  pursuant to 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The
Company will further evaluate its implementation plan in fiscal 2006 to meet its
compliance  requirements  for the  fiscal  year  ending  October  27,  2007.  In
connection with this  significant  effort,  Management  believes that normal and
customary  expenses related to implementation of the required current provisions
of the Act may be in the range of $250,000 - $350,000 for fiscal 2007.

The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements as of January 28, 2006.

Management  believes that cash on hand, cash flow from operations and funds made
available under the credit facility with Webster, will be sufficient to meet the
Company's  anticipated  working capital needs for at least the next twelve-month
period.

Seasonality

The  Company's  business is subject to seasonal  variations.  Historically,  the
Company has  realized a slight  increase in its total  revenue and a majority of
its net  income  for the  year  during  the  first  fiscal  quarter.  Due to the
importance of the holiday shopping season, any factors negatively  impacting the
holiday  selling season could have an adverse  effect on the Company's  revenues
and its  ability  to  generate  a profit.  The  Company's  quarterly  results of
operations  may  also  fluctuate  significantly  due  to a  number  of  factors,
including  the timing of new store  openings  and  acquisitions  and  unexpected
changes in volume-related rebates or changes in cooperative advertising policies
from manufacturers. In addition, operating results may be negatively affected by
increases in merchandise costs, price changes in response to competitive factors
and unfavorable local, regional or national economic developments that result in
reduced consumer spending.

Impact of Inflation

Management does not believe that inflation has had a material  adverse effect on
the  Company's  results of  operations.  However,  the  Company  cannot  predict
accurately the effect of inflation on future operating results.

Item 4. Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the  participation  of the Company's  Management,
including the Chief Executive Officer/President and the Chief Financial Officer,
the Company  carried out an  evaluation of the  effectiveness  of the design and
operation  of the  disclosure  controls  and  procedures,  as  defined  in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange  Act").  Based upon that  evaluation,  the Company's  Chief  Executive
Officer/President  and Chief  Financial  Officer  concluded  that the  Company's
disclosure  controls and procedures  are effective,  as of the end of the period
covered by this Report (January 28, 2006), in ensuring that material information
relating to the Company  required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that
it files or submits  under the Exchange Act is recorded,  processed,  summarized
and reported  within the time periods  specified in the  Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules and forms,  including ensuring that such material information
is  accumulated  and  communicated  to the Company's  Management,  including the
Company's Chief Executive  Officer/President  and Chief  Financial  Officer,  as
appropriate to allow timely decisions  regarding required  disclosure.

As noted  above,  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  has  extended  the
compliance   dates  for   non-accelerated   filers,   pursuant  to  404  of  the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Company will further evaluate its implementation
plan in fiscal 2006 to meet its  compliance  requirements  of fiscal year ending
October 27, 2007.

There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting
(as required by the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Company's last fiscal
quarter that have materially  affected,  or are reasonably  likely to materially
affect, the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.

                           PART II. OTHER INFORMATION:

Items 2, 3, 4 and 5 were not applicable in the quarter ended January 28, 2006.

Item 1. Legal Matters

In July 2003,  the Company  received a notice and  information  request from the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection ("PADEP"). The notice stated
that  PADEP   considers  the  Company  a  potentially   responsible   party  for
contamination  related to a septic  drain  field  located  at a former  Chem Fab
Corporation ("Chem Fab") in Doylestown, Pennsylvania.

PADEP's  notice  stated that if Chem Fab was  previously  owned by Harvey Radio,
Inc.  ("Harvey Radio") and if the Company was a successor to Harvey Radio,  then
the Company could be, in part,  responsible for any environmental  investigation
or clean up actions necessary at this site.

Harvey Radio was the  predecessor of The Harvey Group,  Inc.  ("Harvey  Group"),
which filed for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States  Bankruptcy Code in
August 1995. The Company is the surviving  retail  business of the Harvey Group,
which emerged from  bankruptcy  in December  1996.  Chem Fab was a  wholly-owned
subsidiary of Harvey Radio as of September  1967.  The capital stock of Chem Fab
(a then wholly-owned  subsidiary of Harvey Group) was sold by the Company to the
Boarhead  Corporation in January 1978. The  disposition of Chem Fab was prior in
time to the Company's bankruptcy petition date of August 3, 1995.

On August 29, 2003, the Company sent its response letter to PADEP. The Company's
response  stated  that any action by PADEP to recover any money from the Company
relating to any environmental investigation or cleanup related to Chem Fab is in
violation of the injunctions  imposed by virtue of the Company's 1995 Bankruptcy
proceeding.  The response  letter to PADEP  specifically  referred to two cases,
with respect to entities  subject to a discharge in  bankruptcy  by the Southern
District of New York and the Second  Circuit  Court of Appeals.  These cases may
support the Company's position enjoining any further action against the Company.

The Company believes PADEP's claim, even absent the bankruptcy injunction, would
be improper  against the Company,  as Harvey Group was a shareholder of Chem Fab
and Chem Fab's capital stock was sold in 1978, as previously stated.

The Company  advised PADEP that any further action to pursue a claim against the
Company would result in the Company  bringing a motion to reopen its  bankruptcy
case, solely to address the PADEP claim and further,  the Company would commence
contempt  proceedings  against  PADEP.  To date,  the Company has not received a
response from PADEP.

The  Company has also  retained  special  environmental  counsel for advice with
respect to PADEP's request for information and other matters with respect to the
claim.

Furthermore, the number of other parties that may be responsible,  their ability
to share in the cost of a clean up and whether the  Company's  existing or prior
insurance  policies provide coverage for this matter is not known. At this time,
it is impossible for the Company to determine the outcome or cost to the Company
on this matter.

 THIRD AMENDMENT
 
Exhibit 10.3

                            THIRD AMENDMENT AGREEMENT

THIS THIRD AMENDMENT  AGREEMENT (this "Third Amendment") is entered into as
of  February  17,  2006  by and  among  Harvey  Electronics,  Inc.,  a New  York
corporation ("Borrower"), and Webster Business Credit Corporation ("Lender").

                                  Introduction

     Borrower and Lender are parties to a Loan and Security  Agreement  dated as
of November 21, 2003 (as amended through the date hereof and as further amended,
restated,  supplemented  or  otherwise  modified  from  time to time,  the "Loan
Agreement")  pursuant to which Lender has agreed to make revolving  credit loans
and to provide certain other financial accommodations to Borrower.

     Borrower has requested certain amendments to the Loan Agreement.  Lender is
willing to effect the amendments of the Loan Agreement  requested by Borrower on
the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

     NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants
herein contained, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency  of which are hereby  acknowledged,  Borrower  and  Lender  agree as
follows:

     1.  Amendments  to the  Loan  Agreement.  Upon  the date  that  this  Third
Amendment  shall  have  been  executed  by each of the  parties  hereto  and all
conditions set forth in Section 3 of this Third  Amendment have been  satisfied,
Borrower and Lender agree that the Loan Agreement shall be amended as follows:

     (b)  Subsection  7.21 of the Loan  Agreement is hereby  further  amended by
adding the following clause (d) thereto:

          (d)(i) Minimum EBITDA (Section 7.2 1(a)): Excess Availability.  Lender
               agrees that the one month  Minimum  EBITDA  covenant set forth at
               Section  7.21(a)  above  will not be tested as of the last day of
               any fiscal month during which the Borrower's average daily Excess
               Availability was equal to or greater than $1,500,000.

          (ii) Additional   Capital.  If  at  any  time  the  Borrower  receives
               additional capital in the form of equity or subordinated debt, in
               either  instance  on terms  and  conditions  satisfactory  to the
               Lender in its Permitted  Discretion,  in the minimum gross amount
               of  $3,500,000,   then  the   $1,500,000   average  daily  Excess
               Availability  referred to in the foregoing clause (d)(i) shall be
               deemed reduced to $1,000,000.

     2. Lender's Rights. Lender expressly reserves the full extent of its rights
under the Loan  Agreement,  the other Loan  Documents  and  applicable  law with
respect to any Default or Event of Default existing on the date hereof

     3. Conditions Precedent to Third Amendment. The satisfaction of each of the

Agreement,  as amended  hereby,  and the other Loan Documents  shall be true and

     6. Effect on Loan  Agreement.  Except as  expressly  provided  herein,  the
execution,  delivery,  and performance of this Third Amendment shall not operate

amended  hereby,  the Loan  Agreement  and all  other  Loan  Documents  shall be
unaffected  hereby,  shall continue in full force and effect,  are hereby in all
respects ratified and confirmed,  and shall constitute the legal, valid, binding
and enforceable obligations of Borrower to the Lender.

     7. No Novation; Entire Agreement. This Third Amendment evidences solely the
amendment of certain terms and  provisions of Borrower's  obligations  under the
Loan  Agreement  expressly  set forth  herein and is not a novation or discharge
thereof. There are no other understandings,  express or implied,  between Lender
and Borrower regarding the subject matter hereof.

     8. Choice of Law. The validity of this Third Amendment,  its  construction,
interpretation and enforcement,  and the rights of the parties hereunder,  shall
be determined  under,  governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of

principles.

"hereof'  or words of like  import  referring  to the Loan  Agreement,  and each
reference  in the other Loan  Documents to "the Loan  Agreement",  "thereunder",

shall mean and be a reference to the Loan Agreement as amended hereby.

     10.  Counterparts;  Telefacsimile  Execution.  This Third  Amendment may be
executed  in any number of  counterparts  and by  different  parties in separate
counterparts,  each of which when so executed and delivered,  shall be deemed an
original,  and all of which,  when taken together,  shall constitute one and the
same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this
Third  Amendment  by  facsimile  shall be as effective as delivery of a manually
executed  counterpart of this Third Amendment.  Any party delivering an executed
counterpart  of this Third  Amendment by facsimile also shall deliver a manually
executed  counterpart  of this  Third  Amendment  but the  failure  to deliver a
manually executed counterpart shall not affect the validity, enforceability, and
binding effect of this Third Amendment.

                   [Signatures appear on the following page.]

IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  Borrower and Lender caused this Third Amendment to be
executed as of the date first above written.

1.   I have  reviewed this  quarterly  report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter
     ended January 28, 2006;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material  fact or omit to state a  material  fact  necessary  to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances  under which such statements
     were made,  not  misleading  with  respect  to the  period  covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my  knowledge,  the  financial  statements,  and  other  financial
     information  included  in  this  report,  fairly  present  in all  material
     respects the financial  condition,  results of operations and cash flows of
     the Registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report.

4.   The  Registrant's  other  certifying  officer  and  I are  responsible  for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Exchange Act Rules  13a-15(e) and  15d-15(e))  for the Registrant and we
     have:

     (a)  Designed  such  disclosure  controls  and  procedures,  or caused such
          disclosure   controls  and   procedures  to  be  designed   under  our
          supervision,  to ensure  that  material  information  relating  to the
          Registrant  is made  known to us by  others,  particularly  during the
          period in which this report is being prepared;

     (b)  Evaluated the  effectiveness of the Registrant's  disclosure  controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions  about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end
          of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

     (c)  Disclosed  in this  report  any  change in the  Registrant's  internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the Registrant's
          third fiscal  quarter that has materially  affected,  or is reasonably
          likely to materially  affect,  the Registrant's  internal control over
          financial reporting; and

5.   The Registrant's  other certifying  officer and I have disclosed,  based on
     our most recent valuation of internal control over financial reporting,  to
     the Registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of Registrant's board of
     directors:

     a)   All significant deficiencies and any material weaknesses in the design
          or operation of internal  control over financial  reporting  which are
          reasonably  likely to  adversely  affect the  Registrant's  ability to
          record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

     b)   Any fraud, whether or not material,  that involves management or other
          employees who have a  significant  role in the  Registrant's  internal
          control over financial reporting.
