       Note
      1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Nature
      of Business  

FuelCell
      Energy, Inc. is engaged in the development and manufacture of high temperature
      fuel cells for clean electric power generation. Our Direct FuelCell        
      ( DFC
        )
      power
      plants produce reliable, secure and environmentally friendly base load
      electricity for commercial and industrial, government and other customers.
      We
      are currently in the process of commercializing our DFC carbonate products
      and
      are beginning the development of planar solid oxide fuel cell technology. We
      expect to incur losses as we continue to participate in government cost share
      programs, sell products at prices lower than our current production costs,
      and
      invest in our cost-out initiatives. 

Basis
      of Presentation - Interim Consolidated financial statements  

The
      accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared
      in
      accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
      of
      America ( GAAP ), for interim financial information, and with the instructions
      to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not contain
      all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial
      statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal
      recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly our financial position as
      of
      January 31, 2006 have been included. The balance sheet as of October 31, 2005
      has been derived from the audited financial statements at that
      date. 

The
      preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with
      GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
      reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
      and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and
      revenues and expenses during the period reported. Actual results could differ
      from those estimates. 

The
      results of operations and cash flows for the three months ended January 31,
      2006
      are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.
      The reader should supplement the information in this document with prior
      disclosures in our 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

Consolidation  

The
      consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our
      subsidiaries, including our Canadian subsidiary, FuelCell Energy, Ltd.
      Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Alliance Monterrey,
      LLC; Alliance Chico, LLC; Alliance Star Energy, LLC; and Alliance TST Energy,
      LLC are joint ventures with Alliance Power, Inc. to construct fuel cell power
      plants and sell power under power purchase agreements to the following
      customers: the City of Santa Barbara, the Sierra Nevada Brewering Co., the
      Sheraton San Diego Hotel   Marina, the Westin San Francisco Airport Hotel
      and TST Inc., respectively. The financial results of the joint ventures are
      consolidated with those of FuelCell Energy, Inc., which owns 80 percent of
      each
      entity. Cumulative minority interest in these Alliance entities is not material
      to the consolidated financial statements.  

Certain
      reclassifications have been made to our prior year amounts to conform to the
      2006 presentation. 

Foreign
      Currency Translation  

Our
      Canadian subsidiary, FuelCell Energy, Ltd., is financially and operationally
      integrated and therefore the temporal method of translation of foreign
      currencies is followed. The functional currency is U.S. dollars. We recognized
      a
      foreign currency gain of approximately $.05 million and a foreign currency
      loss
      of approximately $.03 million during the three months ended January 31, 2006
      and
      2005, respectively. These amounts have been classified in interest and other
      income on our consolidated statement of operations.

Comprehensive
      Loss  

Comprehensive
      loss was $15.1 million and $18.3 million for the three months ended January
      31,
      2006 and 2005, respectively. Comprehensive loss for the three months ended
      January 31, 2005 included an adjustment to retained earnings totaling
      approximately $0.2 million as a result from switching from the cost to equity
      method of accounting for our investment in Versa. Refer also to Note 3  
Equity Investments.  

Recent
      Accounting Pronouncements  

In
      December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued SFAS No.
      123 (revised 2004) ( SFAS No. 123R ),  Share-Based Payment  which revised SFAS
      No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation . This statement supercedes
      APB Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.  The revised
      statement addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions with
      employees and other third parties, eliminates the ability to account for
      share-based compensation transactions using APB 25 and requires that the
      compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the
      consolidated statement of operations. The Company adopted this statement as
      of
      November 1, 2005, as required, utilizing the modified prospective method.
      Share-based compensation of $1.1 million was recognized in the consolidated
      statement of operations for the three months ended January 31, 2006. Refer
      to
      Note 7 for additional information. 

In
      November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,  Inventory Costs,  which
      amends the guidance in Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4,
 Inventory Pricing,  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle
      facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material. This statement
      requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges regardless
      of
      whether they meet the criterion of  so abnormal . In addition, this statement
      requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of
      conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The
      Company adopted the provisions of this accounting standard on November 1, 2005,
      as required, and there was not a material impact to the Company s financial
      statements.  

In
      March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47,  Accounting for
      Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement
      No. 143  ( FIN 47 ). FIN 47 requires the recognition of a liability for the
      fair value of a legally-required conditional asset retirement obligation when
      incurred, if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 also
      clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably
      estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 is effective
      for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005, or no later than our
      fiscal fourth quarter of 2006. We have not yet determined the impact of adopting
      this statement on our consolidated financial statements.  

Note
      2.    Discontinued Operations  

During
      fiscal 2004, we acquired, Global Thermoelectric Inc. (Global) and subsequently
      divested its generator product line through the sale of Global on May 28, 2004.
      As a result, historical results were reclassified as discontinued operations.
      During the three months ended January 31, 2005, we exited certain facilities
      related to this business and as a result recorded fixed asset impairment charges
      totaling approximately $0.9 million. In addition, we incurred approximately
      $0.4
      million of exit costs related to these facilities, which resulted in total
      loss
      from discontinued operations of approximately $1.3 million. There were no
      discontinued operations during the three months ended January 31,
      2006.

Note
      3. Equity investments  

On
      November 1, 2004, we transferred substantially all of our Canadian solid oxide
      fuel cell ( SOFC ) assets and operations (including manufacturing and test
      equipment, intellectual property and personnel) to Versa. In exchange, we
      received 5,714 shares of Versa common stock, increasing our ownership position
      in Versa to 7,714 shares. No cash was exchanged in the transaction. The
      consideration received by us in the transaction was determined based upon
      arms-length negotiations of the parties. 

Our
      investment in Versa totaled approximately $12.1 million and $12.3 million as
      of
      January 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005, respectively. Our current ownership
      interest is 40 percent and we account for Versa under the equity method of
      accounting.  

Note
      4. Investments  

Our
      short
      and long-term investments are in U.S. treasury securities, which are held to
      maturity. The following table summarizes the amortized cost basis and fair
      value
      at January 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005:  

Reported
      as:   

As
      of
      January 31, 2006, short-term investment securities have maturity dates ranging
      from February 15, 2006 to January 31, 2007, and estimated yields ranging from
      2.71 percent to 4.40 percent. Long-term investment securities have maturity
      dates ranging from April 30, 2007 to December 31, 2007, and estimated yields
      ranging from 3.72 percent to 4.36 percent. Our weighted average yield on our
      short and long-term investments was 3.71 percent as of January 31,
      2006.

      5. Inventories  

The
      components of inventory at January 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005 consisted
      of
      the following: 

Our
      inventories are stated at the lower of recoverable cost or market price. We
      provide for a lower of cost or market adjustment against gross inventory values.
      Our lower of cost or market adjustment, reducing gross inventory values to
      the
      reported amounts, was approximately $8.3 million and $7.8 million at January
      31,
      2006 and October 31, 2005, respectively. 

Note
      6. Property, Plant and Equipment  

Property,
      plant and equipment at January 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005 consisted of the
      following: 

____ 

(1)    
             
                Included
                in construction in progress are costs of approximately $3.7 million
                and
                $1.5 million at January 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005, respectively,
                to
                build power plants, which will service power purchase agreement contracts.
                These plants are being constructed by joint ventures, which the Company
                is
                an 80 percent owner and, as a result, consolidated on our financial
                statements.  

Depreciation
      expense was approximately $2.2 million and $1.8 million for the three months
      ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 

There
      were no asset impairment charges during the three months ended January 31,
      2006.
  During
      the three months ended January 31, 2005, we recorded a fixed asset impairment
      charge related to an obsolete catalyst extruding system totaling $1.0 million,
      against cost of product sales. This was related to a planned change in
      manufacturing processes that is expected to improve product performance and
      reduce costs in future periods. In addition, during the three months ended
      January 31, 2005, we recorded a fixed asset impairment charge to discontinued
      operations totaling $0.9 million related to excess facilities in Calgary,
      Alberta, Canada.

Note
      7. Share-Based Compensation   

The
      Company has shareholder approved equity incentive plans and a shareholder
      approved Section 423 Stock Purchase Plan (the  ESPP ), which are described in
      more detail below.  

On
      November 1, 2005, we adopted SFAS No. 123R,  Share-Based Payment  utilizing the
      modified prospective approach. This statement supercedes APB Opinion No. 25,
       Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees , which we used to account for
      share-based compensation transactions prior to November 1, 2005. The
      compensation cost that has been charged against income for Share-Based Plans
      was
      $1.1 million for the three months ended January 31, 2006 and included $0.1
      million in cost of product sales and revenues, $0.1 million in cost of research
      and development contracts, $0.7 million in general and administrative expense
      and $0.2 million in research and development expenses. There was no share-based
      compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations
      for
      the three months ended January 31, 2005.  

The
      following table illustrates the effect on net loss and net loss per basic and
      diluted share for the three months ended January 31, 2005 as if we had applied
      the fair value method to our stock-based compensation:

Equity
      Incentive Plans   

The
      Board
      adopted the 1988 and 1998 Equity Incentive Plans (collectively,  the Plans ).
      Under the terms of the Plans, 10,206,000 shares of common stock may be granted
      as options or stock to our officers, key employees and directors. Pursuant
      to
      the Plans, the Board is authorized to grant incentive stock options or
      nonqualified options and stock appreciation rights to our officers and key
      employees and may grant nonqualified options and stock appreciation rights
      to
      our directors. Stock options and stock appreciation rights have restrictions
      as
      to transferability. The option exercise price shall be fixed by the Board but
      in
      the case of incentive stock options, shall not be less than 100 percent of
      the
      fair market value of the shares subject to the option on the date the option
      is
      granted. Stock appreciation rights may be granted in conjunction with options
      granted under the Plans. Stock options that have been granted are generally
      exercisable commencing one year after grant at the rate of 25 percent of such
      shares in each succeeding year and have a ten-year maximum term. There were
      no
      stock appreciation rights outstanding at January 31, 2006 and 2005. Refer also
      to Note 12   Subsequent Events regarding the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan.

        (Tabular
        amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 

The
      fair
      value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the
      Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the
      following table. Expected volatility for the three months ended January 31,
      2006
      is based on a combination of the historical volatility of the Company s stock
      and the implied volatility from traded options. Expected volatility for the
      three months ended January 31, 2005 is based on the historical volatility of
      the
      Company s stock. We use historical data to estimate the expected term of options
      granted. 

The
      following table summarizes the Plans  stock option activity for the three months
      ended January 31, 2006: 

The
      weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted during the three
      months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 was $5.07 and $6.60, respectively. The
      total intrinsic value of options outstanding and options exercisable at January
      31, 2006 was $20.8 million and $18.4 million, respectively. The total intrinsic
      value of options exercised during the three months ended January 31, 2006 and
      2005, was $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively.

As
      of
      January 31, 2006, total compensation cost related to nonvested stock options
      not
      yet recognized was $8.1 million, which is expected to be recognized over the
      next 1.5 years on a weighted-average basis.  

In
      the
      first quarter of fiscal 2006, we issued 6,965 shares of common stock with a
      value of $0.06 million to directors as compensation (in lieu of cash) under
      the
      1998 equity incentive plan. These shares were fully vested at the date of grant.
      No shares of common stock were issued to directors under this plan for the
      three
      months ended January 31, 2005.  

Employee
      Stock Purchase Plan   

Our
      shareholders adopted a Section 423 Stock Purchase Plan (the  ESPP ) on April
      30, 1993, which has been amended from time to time by the Board. The total
      shares allocated to the ESPP are 900,000. Under the ESPP, eligible employees
      have the right to subscribe to purchase shares of common stock at the lesser
      of
      85 percent of the high and low market prices on the first day of the purchase
      period or the last day of the purchase period and such purchased shares have
      a
      six month vesting period. As of January 31, 2006, there were 375,525 shares
      of
      Common Stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP. These shares may be adjusted
      for any future stock splits. As of January 31, 2006, we had 102 employees
      enrolled and participating in the ESPP.  

Activity
      in the ESPP for the three months ended January 31, 2006 was as
      follows: 

The
      weighted-average grant date fair value of shares under the ESPP during the
      three
      months ended January 31, 2006 was $2.54.

      assumptions: 

Incentive
      Compensation   

Stock
      may
      be issued to employees as part of FuelCell s annual incentive bonus. During the
      first quarter of fiscal 2006, we issued 75,585 shares of common stock with
      a
      value of $0.7 million as incentive bonus (in lieu of cash). No such shares
      were
      issued for the three months ended January 31, 2005, however 67,456 shares of
      common stock as incentive bonus (in lieu of cash) were issued in the third
      quarter of fiscal 2005.  

Note
      8. Shareholders' Equity   

Changes
      in shareholders  equity were as follows for the three months ended January 31,
      2006: 

Series
      B Preferred Shares   

On
      November 11, 2004, we entered into a purchase agreement with Citigroup Global
      Markets Inc.; RBC Capital Markets Corporation; Adams Harkness, Inc.; and Lazard
      Freres   Co., LLC (the  Initial Purchasers ) for the private placement under
      Rule 144A of up to 135,000 shares of our 5% Series B Cumulative Convertible
      Perpetual Preferred Stock (Liquidation Preference $1,000). On November 17,
      2004
      and January 25, 2005, we closed on the sale of 100,000 shares and 5,875 shares,
      respectively, of Series B preferred stock to the Initial Purchasers. Net
      proceeds to us were approximately $99.0 million. Upon a fundamental change
      in
      control of the Company, we may at our option, elect to pay the change of control
      price in cash or, in shares of common stock valued at a discount of 5% from
      the
      market price of the shares of common stock, or any combination thereof.

Preferred
      shares of subsidiary   

In
      conjunction with our acquisition of Global, we assumed the preferred share
      obligation comprised of 1,000,000 Series 2 non-voting Preferred Shares. With
      the
      sale of the Global entity in May of 2004, the Global Series 2 Preferred Shares
      were cancelled, and replaced with equivalent Series 1 Preferred Shares
      (Preferred Shares) issued by FuelCell Energy, Ltd. The Preferred Shares are
      convertible at the option of the holder into a certain number of our common
      shares based on the date of conversion. 

Warrants   

We
      issued
      warrants to purchase shares of our common stock to Marubeni Corp. and Enbridge
      Inc. as part of their distribution agreements. The warrants for each distributor
      vest in separate tranches if certain order levels are received by specified
      dates. As of January 31, 2006, Marubeni held 600,000 warrants and Enbridge
      held
      1,000,000 warrants that were unvested.  

Note
      9. Segment Information and Major Customers  

Under
      SFAS No. 131,  Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
      Information,  we use the  management  approach to reporting segments. The
      management approach designates the internal organization that is used by
      management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the
      source of reportable segments. SFAS No. 131 also requires disclosures about
      products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. Under SFAS No.
      131, we have identified one business segment: fuel cell power plant production
      and research. 

Enterprise-wide
      Information  

Enterprise-wide
      information provided on geographic revenues is based on the customer s ordering
      location. The following table presents revenues (greater than ten percent of
      our
      total revenues) for geographic areas:

Information
      about Major Customers  

We
      contract with a small number of customers for the sales of our products or
      research and development contracts. Those customers that accounted for greater
      than ten percent of our total revenues during the three months ended January
      31,
      2006 and 2005 are as follows: 

____ 

      *
      Less
      than 10 percent of total revenues in period.  

      (1)
      -
      Includes government agencies such as the U.S. Department of Energy and the
      U.S.
      Navy either directly or through prime contractors. 

Note
      10. Earnings Per Share   

Basic
      and
      diluted earnings per share are calculated using the following data: 

____ 

(1)    
             
                We
                computed earnings per share without consideration to potentially
                dilutive
                instruments due to the fact that losses incurred would make them
                antidilutive. Future potentially dilutive stock options that were
                in-the-money at January 31, 2006 and 2005 totaled 3,537,225 and
                2,469,610  ,
                respectively. Future potentially dilutive stock options that were
                not
                in-the-money at January 31, 2006 and 2005 totaled 2,537,543 and
                2,763,043  ,
                respectively. We also have issued warrants, which vest and expire
                over
                time  .
                These warrants, if dilutive, would be excluded from the calculation
                of EPS
                since their vesting is contingent upon certain future performance
                requirements that are not yet probable.

Note
      12. Subsequent Events  

In
      February 2006, the Board adopted, subject to shareholder approval, the Company's
      2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"). The purpose of the 2006 Plan
      is to
      attract and retain key employees, directors, advisors and consultants, to
      provide an incentive for them to assist the Company to achieve long-range
      performance goals and to enable them to participate in the long-term growth
      of
      the Company. Under the 2006 Plan, the Company may grant (i) incentive stock
      options intended to qualify under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code
      of
      1986, as amended, (ii) options that are not qualified as incentive stock
      options, (iii) stock appreciation rights either in tandem with an option or
      alone and unrelated to an option, and (iv) restricted shares of Common Stock.
      There are a total of 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock available for issuance
      under the 2006 Plan, subject to adjustment for any stock dividend,
      recapitalization, stock split, stock combination or certain other corporate
      reorganizations. Shares issued may consist in whole or in part of authorized
      but
      unissued shares or treasury shares. Shares subject to an award that expires
      or
      is terminated or is forfeited for any reason or settled in a manner that results
      in fewer shares outstanding than were initially awarded will again be available
      for award under the 2006 Plan. 

A
      complete description of this plan was included in our 2006 Proxy Statement
      and
      will be voted on by shareholders at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of
      FuelCell Energy, Inc on March 28, 2006.

OVERVIEW  

FuelCell
      Energy is a world leader in the development and manufacture of fuel cell power
      plants for clean, efficient and reliable electric power generation.  We
      have been developing fuel cell technology since our founding in 1969. We are
      currently commercializing our core carbonate fuel cell products ( Direct
      FuelCell        
      or
 DFC       
      Power
      Plants ), offering stationary applications for commercial and industrial
      customers and continuing to develop our next generation of carbonate fuel cell
      products. In addition, we are developing another high temperature fuel cell
      system, planar solid oxide fuel cell ( SOFC ) technology, as a prime contractor
      in the U.S. Department of Energy s ( DOE ) Solid State Energy Conversion
      Alliance ( SECA ) Program and through our 40 percent ownership interest in Versa
      Power Systems, Inc. ( Versa ). 

17 

Our
      proprietary carbonate DFC power plants electrochemically produce electricity
      directly from readily available hydrocarbon fuels, such as natural gas and
      biomass fuels. We believe our products offer significant advantages compared
      to
      other power generation technologies. The primary benefits to our customers
      include: 

High
                fuel efficiency; 

Ultra-clean
                emissions; 

High
                reliability;  

The
                ability to site units locally and provide heat for cogeneration
                applications. 

Other
      customer benefits of our DFC power plants include: 

Quiet
                operation; 

Flexible
                siting and permitting capabilities;

Potentially
                lower operating, maintenance and generation costs than alternative
                distributed power generation technologies and the grid;
                and, 

The
                ability to provide end users with greater control of their energy
                source
                costs and reliability. 

The
      demand for reliable, clean and economical power is increasing worldwide.
      Volatile fuel and energy prices, the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by
      over
      140 countries in 2005 and other strict emissions guidelines mandating clean
      electric power generation are placing greater emphasis on high efficiency
      distributed generation products that are ultra-clean. Electric generation
      without combustion (ultra-clean) significantly reduces harmful pollutants such
      as NOX, SOX and particulates. Higher efficiency results in lower emissions
      of
      carbon dioxide, a major contributor of harmful greenhouse gases. Higher
      efficiency also results in less fuel per kWh of electricity and Btu of heat
      produced, thereby reducing operating costs.  

Our
      core
      products, the DFC300MA, DFC1500MA and DFC3000, are currently rated in capacity
      at 250 kW, 1 MW and 2 MW, respectively, and these capacities are expected to
      increase to 300 kW, 1.2 MW and 2.4 MW, respectively, in late-2006. Our products
      are designed to meet the base load power requirements of a wide range of
      commercial and industrial customers including wastewater treatment plants
      (municipal, such as sewage treatment facilities, and industrial, such as
      breweries and food processors), hotels, manufacturing facilities, universities,
      hospitals, telecommunications/data centers, government facilities, as well
      as
      grid support applications for utility customers.  Ideally, our DFC power
      plants are part of a total onsite power generation solution for commercial
      and
      industrial customers, with our high efficiency products providing the base
      load
      power. Grid-delivered electricity or less efficient combustion-based equipment
      can provide peaking and load following energy needs. Through January 31, 2006,
      over 94 million kWhs of electricity have been generated from power plants
      incorporating our DFC technology at over 40 customer sites
      worldwide. 

While
      our
      products compete essentially on price with gas engines, turbines and the grid,
      we believe that the attributes of our DFC products enhance our value
      proposition. For example, in some regions with strict air emissions controls,
      the  ultra-clean  designation of our DFC power plants enables our products to be
      sited where combustion-based technologies cannot. As an ultra-clean technology,
      our products benefit from: (1) preferential rate treatment, such as the
      elimination of exit fees and standby charges for onsite electric generation;
      (2)
      a streamlined installation process with exemptions from air pollution control
      or
      air quality district permitting requirements; and (3) qualification for
      government-sponsored incentive programs for clean, high efficiency and firm
      24/7
      power generation. 

While
      we
      believe that we are making significant progress, we continue to face obstacles
      that can lengthen the sales cycle.  Recently, sales have been impacted by
      volatile fuel prices and lagging electric rates. We can face regulatory
      uncertainty for distributed generation, long capital appropriation cycles,
      interconnect issues, disparate recognition of the locational value and
      environmental benefits of distributed generation, standby power costs and
      stranded asset exit fees.  In addition, due to the early commercialization
      stage of our DFC power plants and our low volume of sales, our product pricing
      is generally higher than competing products that are more mature. These
      factors can slow and constrict our sales cycle and delay our growth. Our sales
      for the last two years have been approximately 6 MW of power plants per
      year. 

18 

We
      are
      currently selling our products to customers in high cost electricity markets.
      We
      believe that market clearing prices in California and the Northeast are between
      $2,000 and $3,000 per kW and up to $4,000/kW in Asia and for mission-critical
      applications that demand higher reliability. The manufactured cost of
      o  ur
      standard sub-MW product design at the end of 2005 was approximately $4,600
      per
      kW (reduced from approximately $6,200/kW at the end of 2004) and our 1 MW
      product was approximately $4,300/kW. Our cost reduction plans and increased
      volume will bring us closer to market clearing prices through process
      improvements, value engineering, supplier/purchasing opportunities, and product
      output and efficiency improvements. Our primary focus in 2006 is to attempt
      to
      reduce the cost of our 2 MW DFC3000 power plant to a range between $3,200/kW
      and
      $3,500/kW, and below $3,000/kW with increased volume.  

Recent
      Developments   

Change
      in Executive Management   

On
      January 12, 2006, FuelCell Energy, Inc. announced that R. Daniel Brdar was
      promoted to President and Chief Executive Officer. Jerry D. Leitman retained
      the
      position of Chairman of the Board   in
      the
      Company's planned management succession.  

On
      February 15, 2006, Dr. Hans Maru retired as Chief Technology Officer, but will
      remain as a consultant to the Company. The Chief Technology Officer
      responsibilities, formerly held by Dr. Maru, will be assumed by executives
      within commercial products and research and development. 

Common
      Stock Offering  

During
      January and February 2006, we sold 100,000 shares of our common stock on the
      open market pursuant to a S-3 registration statement filed in June 2005. Total
      net proceeds to us from the sale of these securities was approximately $1.1
      million and is intended to be used for general corporate purposes and dividend
      payments on our convertible preferred stock. 

2006
      Equity Incentive Plan  

In
      February 2006, the Board adopted, subject to shareholder approval, the Company's
      2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"). The purpose of the 2006 Plan
      is to
      attract and retain key employees, directors, advisors and consultants, to
      provide an incentive for them to assist the Company to achieve long-range
      performance goals and to enable them to participate in the long-term growth
      of
      the Company. There are a total of 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock available
      for
      issuance under the 2006 Plan, subject to adjustment for any stock dividend,
      recapitalization, stock split, stock combination or certain other corporate
      reorganizations. A complete description of this plan was included in our 2006
      Proxy Statement and will be voted on by shareholders at the Annual Meeting
      of
      Shareholders of FuelCell Energy, Inc on March 28, 2006. 

Adoption
      of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123R,  Share-Based
      Payments   

On
      November 1, 2005, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
      123R,  Share-Based Payments  (SFAS 123R), which revised SFAS No. 123,
 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation . This statement supercedes APB Opinion
      No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.  The revised statement
      addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees
      and
      other third parties, eliminates the ability to account for share-based
      compensation transactions using APB 25 and requires that the compensation costs
      relating to such transactions be recognized in the consolidated statement of
      operations. Share-based compensation of $1.1 million was recognized in the
      consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended January 31,
      2006. Refer to Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for additional
      information.

CRITICAL
      ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

Revenue
      Recognition  

      We
      contract with our customers to perform research and development, manufacture
      and
      install fuel cell components and power plants under long-term contracts, and
      provide services under contract. We recognize revenue on a method similar to
      the
      percentage-of-completion method. 

Revenues
      on fuel cell research and development contracts are recognized proportionally
      as
      costs are incurred and compared to the estimated total research and development
      costs for each contract. In many cases, we are reimbursed only a portion of
      the
      costs incurred or to be incurred on the contract. Revenues from government
      funded research, development and demonstration programs are generally
      multi-year, cost reimbursement and/or cost shared type contracts or cooperative
      agreements. We are reimbursed for reasonable and allocable costs up to the
      reimbursement limits set by the contract or cooperative agreement.  

While
      government research and development contracts may extend for many years, funding
      is often provided incrementally on a year-by-year basis if contract terms are
      met and Congress has authorized the funds. As of January 31, 2006, research
      and
      development sales backlog totaled $12.9 million, of which 70 percent is funded.
      Should funding be temporarily delayed or if business initiatives change, we
      may
      choose to devote resources to other activities, including internally funded
      research and development. 

Product
      sales and revenues include revenues from power plant sales, service contracts,
      electricity sales under power purchase agreements and incentive funding.
      Revenues from power plant sales are recognized proportionally as costs are
      incurred and assigned to a customer contract by comparing the estimated total
      manufacture and installation costs for each contract to the total contract
      value. Revenues from service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract
      term. Revenue from electricity sales under power purchase agreements are
      recognized as power is produced. Revenue from incentive funding are recognized
      ratably over the term of the incentive funding agreement. 

As
      our
      fuel cell products are in their initial stages of development and market
      acceptance, actual costs incurred could differ materially from those previously
      estimated. Once we have established that our fuel cell products have achieved
      commercial market acceptance and future costs can be reasonably estimated,
      then
      estimated costs to complete an individual contract, in excess of revenue, will
      be accrued immediately upon identification.  

Warrant
      Value Recognition  

Warrants
      have been issued as sales incentives to certain of our business partners. These
      warrants vest as orders from our business partners exceed stipulated levels.
      Should warrants vest, or when management estimates that it is probable that
      warrants will vest, we will record a proportional amount of the fair value
      of
      the warrants against related revenue as a sales discount. Fair value is
      determined through market sources, option pricing models and management
      estimates. 

20 

Inventories  

During
      the procurement and manufacturing process of a fuel cell power plant, costs
      for
      material, labor and overhead are accumulated in raw materials and
      work-in-process inventory until they are transferred to a customer contract,
      at
      which time they are recorded in cost of sales.  

Our
      inventories and advance payments to vendors are stated at the lower of cost
      or
      market price. As we sell products at or below cost, we provide for a lower
      of
      cost or market ( LCM ) adjustment to the cost basis of inventory and advances to
      vendors. This adjustment is computed by comparing the current sales prices
      of
      our power plants to estimated costs of completed power plants. In certain
      circumstances, for long-lead time items, we will make advance payments to
      vendors for future inventory deliveries, which are recorded as a component
      of
      other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet.  

As
      of
      January 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005, the LCM adjustment to the cost basis
      of
      inventory and advance payments to vendors was approximately $8.6 million and
      $8.0 million, respectively, which equates to a reduction of approximately 35
      and
      39 percent, respectively, of the gross inventory value. As inventory levels
      increase or decrease, appropriate adjustments to the cost basis are
      made. 

Internal
      Research and Development Expenses  

We
      conduct internally funded research and development activities to improve current
      or anticipated product performance and reduce product life-cycle costs. These
      costs are classified as research and development expenses on our consolidated
      statements of operations.  

RESULTS
      OF OPERATIONS  

Management
      evaluates the results of operations and cash flows using a variety of key
      performance indicators. Indicators that management uses include revenues
      compared to prior periods and internal forecasts, costs of our products and
      results of our  cost-out  initiatives, and operating cash use. These are
      discussed throughout the  Results of Operations  and  Liquidity and Capital
      Resources  sections.  

Comparison
      of Three Months ended January 31, 2006 and January 31,
      2005    

Revenues
      and costs of revenues  

The
      following tables summarize the components of our revenues and cost of revenues
      for the three months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollar amounts in
      thousands), respectively:  

21 

Total
      revenues for the three months ended January 31, 2006 decreased by $1.6 million,
      or 21 percent, to $5.9 million from $7.6 million during the same period last
      year. 

Product
      sales and revenues  

Product
      sales and revenue  
      de  creased
      $2.0 million to $3.0 million for the three months ended January 31, 2006,
      compared to $5.0 million for the same period in 2005.   Revenue
      during the quarter included approximately $2.0 million of product and stack
      components and approximately $1.0 million of revenue on power purchase and
      service agreements.   The
      decrease in product sales and revenues was primarily due to the timing of
      customer delivery requirements, a production switch to lower cost DFC product
      models and production during the quarter related to power plants being built
      for
      power purchase agreements.  

At
      January 31, 2006, product sales backlog totaled approximately $24.5 million,
      compared to $22.8 million as of January 31, 2005. Included in these figures
      are
      $5.9 million and $1.5 million, respectively, related to long-term service
      agreements. Product backlog does not include power purchase or incentive funding
      agreements. 

Cost
      of
      product sales and revenues increased to $9.4 million during the three months
      ended January 31, 2006, compared to $13.7 million during the same period of
      the
      prior year.  
      Included
      in cost of sales during the first quarter of 2005, was a non-cash fixed asset
      impairment charge totaling approximately $1.0 million. The ratio of product
      cost
      to sales was 3.1-to-1 during the three months ended January 31, 2006, compared
      to 2.7-to-1 during the   three
      months ended January 31, 2005  .
      This
      ratio is inclusive of any lower of cost or market adjustments in cost of sales
      related to power plants for power purchase agreements. Costs related to power
      purchase agreements were $1.9 million and $2.4 million for the three months
      ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Excluding the non-cash fixed
      asset impairment charge and power purchase agreement costs, our cost ratios
      would have been approximately 2.5-to-1 and approximately 2.0-to-1 for the three
      months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The ratio of costs to
      product sales was higher, compared to the same period of a year ago, due to
      increasing spare module components for the growing fleet and higher inventory
      for the transition to cost reduced designs as well as higher insurance costs.

The
      cost
      ratios above that exclude certain items are not considered generally accepted
      accounting principles ( GAAP ) financial measures and should not be considered
      as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared
      in accordance with GAAP. We have used non-GAAP pro forma financial measures
      in
      analyzing financial results because they provide meaningful information
      regarding our operational performance and facilitate management s internal
      comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to competitors 
operating results.  

Our
      products do not ship on an even production schedule. The shipment date to
      customers depends on a number of factors that are outside of our control,
      including siting requirements, timing of construction and permits. We do not
      have the sales or order history to quantify trends as of yet. 

22 

Research
      and development contracts  

Research
      and development revenue in  creased
      $0.4 million to $2.9 million for the three months ended January 31, 2006,
      compared to $2.5 million for the same period in 2005  .
      Research and development contract revenue for the three months ended January
      31,
      2006 was primarily related to solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) development, combined
      cycle Direct FuelCell/Turbine  development under U.S. Department of Energy
      programs and the Navy s Ship Service Fuel Cell program.  

Cost
      of
      research and development contracts increased $0.1 million to $2.9 million during
      the three months ended January 31, 2006, compared to $2.8 million for the same
      period in 2005. The ratio of research and development cost to revenue improved
      to .99-to-1 from 1.1-to-1 over the same quarter a year ago due to the current
      mix of cost share contracts. 

As
      of
      January 31, 2006, research and development sales backlog totaled approximately
      $12.9 million of which Congress has authorized funding of $9.1 million, compared
      to $24.7 million ($14.4 million funded) as of January 31, 2005. In February
      2006, the Company announced that it was selected by the DOE for awards for
      development of a coal-based multi-megawatt SOFC system ($10.6 million) and
      development of a high temperature membrane for low humidity operation of Polymer
      Electrolyte Membrane fuel cells ($2.1 million), both of which will be added
      to
      the backlog once these contracts are finalized. 

Administrative
      and selling expenses  

Administrative
      and selling expenses increased $1.1 million to $4.2 million during the three
      months ended January 31, 2006, compared to $3.1 million in the same period
      of
      the prior year. This increase is primarily due to stock-based compensation
      of
      approximately $0.7 million resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123R and higher
      marketing and professional costs of approximately $0.3 million resulting from
      commercial market development and increased proposal activity for R D and
      commercial contracts. 

Research
      and development expenses  

Research
      and development expenses increased to $5.9 million during the three months
      ended
      January 31, 2006, compared to $5.2 million recorded in the same period of the
      prior year.   The
      increase in the quarter   is
      due to
      development costs for sub and megawatt cost reduction and stack life
      improvements.      

Loss
      from operations  

Loss
      from
      operations for the three months ended January 31, 2006 totaling $16.4 million
      is
      approximately 5 percent lower than the $17.3 million loss recorded in the
      comparable period last year. The decrease in the loss from operations is due
      primarily to lower revenue and costs due to the timing of customer delivery
      requirements and the production switch to lower cost DFC product models,
      partially offset by the recognition of $1.1 million in stock-based compensation
      resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123R, higher marketing and professional
      costs within administrative and selling expenses and higher research and
      development expenses.  

Loss
        from equity investments  

Our
        investment in Versa totaled approximately $12.1 million and $12.3 million
        as of
        January 31, 2006 and as of October 31, 2005, respectively. Our current ownership
        interest is 40% and we account for Versa under the equity method of accounting.
        Our share of equity losses for the three months ended January 31, 2006 and
        2005
        were $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively.   

23 

Interest
        and other income, net  

Interest
      and other income, net, was $1.5 million for the three months ended January
      31,
      2006,   compared
      to $0.9 million for the same period in 2005.  
      Interest
      income increased due to higher average invested balances and higher
      yields. 

Provision
      for income taxes  

We
      believe that due to our efforts to commercialize our DFC products, we will
      continue to incur losses. Based on projections for future taxable income over
      the period in which the deferred tax assets are realizable, management believes
      that significant uncertainty exists surrounding the recoverability of the
      deferred tax assets. Therefore, no tax benefit has been recognized related
      to
      current or prior year losses and other deferred tax assets.  

LIQUIDITY
      AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

We
      had
      approximately $162.8 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments as of
      January 31, 2006, compared to $180.0 million as of October 31, 2005.
  Net
      cash
      and investments used during the three months ended January 31, 2006 was $17.1
      million. Cash and investments used during the first quarter of 2006 reflect
      dividend payments made on our Series B preferred stock of $1.3 million and
      proceeds from the receipt of incentive funding related to our power purchase
      agreements of $0.5 million.  

Cash
      Inflows and Outflows    

Cash
      and
      cash equivalents as of January 31, 2006 totaled $21.8 million, reflecting a
      decrease of $0.9 million from the balance reported as of October 31, 2005.
      The
      key components of our cash inflows and outflows from continuing operations
      were
      as follows: 

Operating
      Activities   :
      During
      the three months ended January 31, 2006, we used $12.0 million in cash in our
      operating activities, compared to an operating cash usage of $16.7 million
      during the comparable period of the prior year. First quarter 2006 cash used
      in
      operating activities consists of a net loss for the period of approximately
      $15.1 million, offset by non-cash adjustments totaling $3.9, including $1.1
      million of stock-based compensation, depreciation expense of $2.2 million and
      other amortization of $0.1 million.  

In
      addition, cash used in working capital totaled approximately $0.8 million
      including an increase in inventories of approximately $2.0 million and increases
      in advances to vendors of approximately $1.0 million due to increased production
      activity as well as higher prepaid insurance of approximately $0.7 million,
      partially offset by higher accounts payable of $2.3 million due to timing of
      inventory payments and increased production activity and higher deferred revenue
      of approximately $1.0 million. 

Investing
      Activities   :  During
      the three months ended January 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing
      activities totaled $12.3 million, compared with approximately $40.6 million
      generated in the comparable period of the prior year. Capital expenditures
      totaled $3.6 million for the three months ended January 31, 2006. This included
      approximately $2.8 million for equipment being built for power purchase
      agreements in our Alliance entities. During the first quarter of 2006,
      approximately $52.0 million of investments in U.S. Treasury Securities matured
      and new treasury purchases were made totaling $36.1 million.  

Financing
      Activities   :  During
      the three months ended January 31, 2006, net cash used by financing activities
      was approximately $1.2 million, compared to net cash provided by financing
      activities of $99.1 million in the comparable period of the prior year. For
      the
      first quarter of 2006, net cash use related primarily to dividend payments
      of
      $1.3 million on our Series B preferred stock and long-term debt payments of
      $0.2
      million, partially offset by proceeds from employee stock option exercises.
      Cash
      provided by financing activities during the three months ended January 31,
      2005
      was due to the Series B preferred stock offering, which resulted in net proceeds
      to us totaling $99.0 million.  

24 

Sources
      and Uses of Cash and Investments   

We
      continue to invest in new product development and bringing our products to
      market and, as such, we are not currently generating positive cash flow from
      our
      operations.  Our operations are funded primarily through sales of equity
      securities and cash generated from customer contracts, including cash from
      government research and development contracts, product sales, power purchase
      agreements and incentive funding. Our future cash requirements depend on
      numerous factors including future involvement in research and development
      contracts, implementing our cost reduction efforts and increasing annual order
      volume. 

Future
      involvement in research and development contracts  

Our
      research and development contracts are generally multi-year, cost reimbursement
      type contracts.  The majority of these are U.S. Government contracts that
      are dependent upon the government s continued allocation of funds and may be
      terminated in whole or in part at the convenience of the government. We will
      continue to seek research and development contracts. To obtain these contracts,
      we must continue to prove the benefits of our technologies and be successful
      in
      our competitive bidding. 

Implementing
      cost reduction efforts on our fuel cell products     

Cost
      reduction of our products is key to improving our operating results in future
      periods. We have reduced our product cost from over $20,000/kW for our 2 MW
      Santa Clara  proof-of-concept  project in 1996-1997 to our current manufactured
      design cost of approximately $4,300/kW on our MW class product and $4,600/kW
      for
      the sub-MW product. Reducing product cost is essential for us to penetrate
      the
      market for our fuel cell products. Cost reductions will reduce and/or eliminate
      the need for incentive funding programs that are currently available to allow
      our product pricing to compete with grid-delivered power and other distributed
      generation technologies, and are critical to us attaining profitability. Our
      multi-disciplined cost reduction program focuses on value engineering,
      manufacturing process improvements, and technology improvements to increase
      power plant output and efficiency. 

We
      continue to target annual cost reductions of 20 to 25 percent per year across
      all product lines. With the market demand shifting toward multi-MW projects
      as a
      result of emerging renewable portfolio standards programs, our focus in 2006
      will be predominantly on cost reduction for the 2 MW DFC3000 power plant. With
      additional value engineering initiatives, we anticipate that we can reduce
      the
      cost of DFC3000 power plant to a range between $3,200/kw to $3,500/kW by the
      end
      of 2006 based on our current production levels. 

Increasing
      annual order volume   

In
      addition to the cost reduction initiatives discussed above we will need to
      increase annual order volume. We believe that increased production volumes
      are
      necessary to lower costs by leveraging supplier/purchasing opportunities,
      incorporate manufacturing process improvements and spread fixed costs over
      more
      units of production. Our manufacturing, testing and conditioning facilities
      have
      equipment in place to accommodate 50 MW of annual production volume. Higher
      production volume will require increasing the manufacturing workforce.

With
      our
      currently achieved and projected annual cost reduction targets, we believe
      we
      can reach gross margin break-even on product sales at a sustained annual order
      and production volume of approximately 35 MW to 50 MW, depending on product
      mix,
      geographic location and other variables such as fuel prices. We believe that
      Company net income break-even can be achieved at a sustained annual order and
      volume production of approximately 75-100 MW assuming a mix of sub-MW and MW
      sales. If this mix trends more toward MW and multi-MW orders, then we believe
      that the gross margin and net income break-even volumes can be lower. Our fiscal
      2005 production volume was approximately 6 MW, which we have recently increased
      to a 9 MW run rate. 

25 

We
      anticipate that our existing capital resources, together with anticipated
      revenues will be adequate to satisfy our planned financial requirements and
      agreements through at least the next twelve months. 

Commitments
      and Significant Contractual Obligations   

A
      summary
      of our significant future commitments and contractual obligations as of January
      31, 2006 and the related payments by fiscal year is summarized as follows (in
      thousands): 

(1)    
             
                Future
                minimum lease payments on capital and operating
                leases. 

(2)    
             
                Short-term
                purchase commitments with suppliers for materials supplies, and services
                incurred in the normal course of business.

(3)    
             
                Quarterly
                dividends of Cdn.$312,500 accrue on the Series 1 preferred shares
                (subject
                to possible reduction pursuant to the terms of the Series 1 preferred
                shares on account of increases in the price of our common stock).
                We have
                agreed to pay a minimum of Cdn.$500,000 in cash or common stock annually
                to Enbridge, Inc., the holder of the Series 1 preferred shares, so
                long as
                Enbridge holds the shares. Interest accrues on cumulative unpaid
                dividends
                at a 2.45 percent quarterly rate, compounded quarterly, until payment
                thereof. Cumulative unpaid dividends and interest at October 31,
                2005 were
                approximately $3.5 million. For the purposes of this disclosure,
                we have
                assumed that the minimum dividend payments would be made through
                2010. In
                2010, we would be required to pay any unpaid and accrued dividends.
                From
                2010 through 2020, we would be required to pay annual dividend amounts
                totaling Cdn.$1.25 million. We have the option of paying these dividends
                in stock or cash.  

(4)    
             
                Dividends
                on Series B preferred stock accrue at an annual rate of 5% paid quarterly.
                The obligations schedule assumes we will pay preferred dividends
                on these
                shares through November 20, 2009, at which time the preferred shares
                may
                be subject to mandatory conversion. We have the option of paying
                the
                dividends in stock or cash. 

On
      June
      29, 2000, we entered into a loan agreement, secured by machinery and equipment,
      and have borrowed an aggregate of $2.2 million under the agreement. The loan
      is
      payable over seven years, with payments of interest only for the first six
      months and then repaid in monthly installments over the remaining six and
      one-half years with interest computed annually based on the ten-year U.S.
      Treasury note plus 2.5 percent. Our current interest rate at January 31, 2006
      is
      6.5 percent and the outstanding principal balance on this loan is approximately
      $0.9 million. 

Approximately
      $0.7 million of our cash and cash equivalents have been pledged as collateral
      for certain banking relationships in which we participate. 

Research
      and Development Cost-Share Contracts  

We
      have
      contracted with various government agencies as either a prime contractor or
      sub-contractor on cost-share contracts and agreements. Cost-share terms require
      that participating contractors share the total cost of the project based on
      an
      agreed upon ratio with the government agency. As of January 31, 2006, our
      research and development sales backlog totaled $12.9 million. As this backlog
      is
      funded in future periods, we will incur additional research and development
      cost-share totaling approximately $7.0 million for which we would not be
      reimbursed by the government. 

26 

Product
      Sales Contracts  

Our
      fuel
      cell power plant products are in the initial stages of development and market
      acceptance. As such, costs to manufacture and install our products exceed
      current market prices. As of January 31, 2006, we had product sales backlog
      of
      approximately $18.6 million. We do not expect sales from this backlog to be
      profitable. 

Long-term
      Service Agreements  

We
      have
      contracted with certain customers to provide service for fuel cell power plants
      ranging from one to thirteen years. Under the provisions of these contracts,
      we
      provide services to maintain, monitor and repair customer power plants. In
      some
      contracts we will provide for replacement of fuel cell stacks. Pricing for
      service contracts is based upon estimates of future costs, which given the
      early
      stage of development could be materially different from actual expenses. As
      of
      January 31, 2006, we had a service agreement sales backlog of approximately
      $5.9
      million. 

Power
      Purchase Agreements  

Power
      purchase agreements (PPAs) are a common arrangement in the energy industry,
      whereby a customer purchases energy per unit delivered from an owner and
      operator of the power generation equipment. A number of our partners do this
      with end use customers, such as Marubeni in Japan and PPL in the U.S., where
      they purchase DFC power plants from us, own and operate the units, and recognize
      revenue as energy is sold to the end user.  

We
      currently have seeded the market with a number of Company funded PPAs to
      penetrate key target markets and develop operational and transactional
      experience. With the added benefit of the investment tax credit and accelerated
      depreciation in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, we believe this experience may
      enable us to attract third party financing for existing and future projects,
      including multi-MW projects. To date, we have funded the development and
      construction of certain fuel cell power plants sited near customers in
      California, and own and operate assets through PPA entities that we control
      along with Alliance Power, Inc.  

We
      have
      qualified for incentive funding for these projects in California under the
      states  Self Generation Incentive Funding Program and from other government
      programs. Funds are payable upon commercial installation and demonstration
      of
      the plant and may require return of the funds for failure of certain performance
      requirements. Revenue related to these incentive funds is recognized ratably
      over the performance period. As of January 31, 2006 we had deferred revenue
      totaling $5.1 million on the consolidated balance sheet related to incentive
      funding received on PPAs. 

Under
      the
      terms of our power purchase agreements, customers agree to purchase power from
      our fuel cell power plants at negotiated rates, generally for periods of five
      to
      ten years. Electricity rates are generally a function of the customer s current
      and future electricity pricing available from the grid. Revenues are earned
      and
      collected under these PPA s as power is produced. As owner of the power plants
      in these PPA entities, we are responsible for all operating costs necessary
      to
      maintain, monitor and repair the power plants. Under certain agreements, we
      are
      also responsible for procuring fuel, generally natural gas, to run the power
      plants. We believe that the assets, including fuel cell power plants in these
      PPA entities, are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets
      based
      on our estimates of future revenues and expenses. Should actual results differ
      from our estimates, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.
      We
      are not required to produce minimum amounts of power under our PPA agreements
      and we have the right to terminate PPA agreements by giving written notice
      to
      the customer, subject to certain exit costs. 

As
      of
      January 31, 2006, we had contracts in place to build and operate 4 MW of power
      plants under power purchase agreements ranging from 5   10 years.

RECENT
      ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

In
      December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued SFAS No.
      123R (revised 2004),  Share-Based Payment , which revised SFAS No. 123,
 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation . This statement supercedes APB Opinion
      No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.  The revised statement
      addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees
      and
      other third parties, eliminates the ability to account for share-based
      compensation transactions using APB 25 and requires that the compensation costs
      relating to such transactions be recognized in the consolidated statement of
      operations. The Company adopted this statement as of November 1, 2005 as
      required. Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
      additional information. 

In
      November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,  Inventory Costs,  which
      amends the guidance in Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4,
 Inventory Pricing,  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle
      facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material. This Statement
      requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges regardless
      of
      whether they meet the criterion of  so abnormal . In addition, this Statement
      requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of
      conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The
      Company adopted the provisions of this accounting standard on November 1, 2005,
      as required, and there was not a material impact to the Company s financial
      statements.  

In
      March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47,  Accounting for
      Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement
      No. 143  ( FIN 47 ). FIN 47 requires the recognition of a liability for the
      fair value of a legally-required conditional asset retirement obligation when
      incurred, if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 also
      clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably
      estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 is effective
      for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005, or no later than our
      fiscal fourth quarter of 2006. We have not yet determined the impact of adopting
      this statement on our consolidated financial statements.

Item
      3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
      RISK   

Interest
      Rate Exposure   

Our
      exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to
      our
      investment portfolio and long term debt obligations. Our investment portfolio
      includes both short-term United States Treasury instruments with maturities
      averaging three months or less, as well as U.S. Treasury notes with fixed
      interest rates with maturities of up to twenty months. Cash is invested
      overnight with high credit quality financial institutions. Based on our overall
      interest exposure at January 31, 2006, including all interest rate sensitive
      instruments, a near-term change in interest rate movements of 1 percent would
      affect our results of operations by approximately $0.2 million
      annually. 

Foreign
      Currency Exchange Risk   

With
      our
      Canadian business entity, FuelCell Energy, Ltd., we are subject to foreign
      exchange risk, although we have taken steps to mitigate those risks where
      possible. As of January 31, 2006, approximately $1.2 million (less than one
      percent) of our total cash, cash equivalents and investments was in currencies
      other than U.S. dollars. The functional currency of FuelCell Energy, Ltd. is
      the
      U.S. dollar. 

We
      recognized approximately $0.05 million in foreign currency gains and $0.03
      million in foreign currency losses during the three months ended January 31,
      2006 and 2005, respectively. This has been recorded as a component of  Interest
      and other income  on our consolidated statement of operations. Although we have
      not experienced significant foreign exchange rate losses to date, we may in
      the
      future, especially to the extent that we do not engage in hedging activities.
      We
      do not enter into derivative financial instruments. The economic impact of
      currency exchange rate movements on our operating results is complex because
      such changes are often linked to variability in real growth, inflation, interest
      rates, governmental actions and other factors. These changes, if material,
      may
      cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies. Consequently,
      isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other
      important economic factors. 

Item
      4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

The
      Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to
      provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the
      Company s periodic SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
      within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such
      information is accumulated and communicated to its principal executive officer
      and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
      regarding required disclosure.  

We
      carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
      of
      our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the
      effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
      procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that
      evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial
      officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
      were effective to provide a reasonable level of assurance in timely alerting
      them to material information required to be included in our periodic SEC
      reports.  

There
      has
      been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred
      during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
      likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
      reporting.

Any
                fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
