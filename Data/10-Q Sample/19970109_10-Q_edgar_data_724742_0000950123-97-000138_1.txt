financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
             AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Thirteen and Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended November 30, 1996 Compared to Thirteen and
Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended November 25, 1995

Net sales of $96,225,000 for the thirteen weeks ended November 30, 1996
increased $2,786,000 (3.0%) as compared to net sales of $93,439,000 for the
thirteen weeks ended November 25, 1995. For the thirty-nine weeks ended
November 30, 1996 net sales increased $9,224,000 (3.8%) to $254,730,000 as
compared to net sales of $245,506,000 for the thirty-nine weeks ended November
25, 1995. Three new stores (Sharonville, Pittsburgh, and an additional store in
New York City) were included in the thirty-nine weeks ended November 30, 1996.
Comparable store net sales decreased 1.4% for the thirteen weeks and increased
1.2% for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 30, 1996 from the 1995 periods.
The 3.8% increase in net sales was, for the most part, the result of an
increase in the number of stores as compared to last year.

Gross profit for the thirteen weeks ended November 30, 1996 was $41,494,000, an
increase of $6,917,000 (20.0%) as compared to $34,577,000 for the fiscal period
ended November 25, 1995. Gross profit for the current year's third quarter
increased principally from higher margins and to a lesser extent from an
increase in net sales. Gross profit for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 30,
1996 was $98,083,000, an increase of $11,798,000 (13.7%) as compared to
$86,285,000 for the fiscal period ended November 25, 1995. Gross profit for the
thirty-nine weeks ended November 30, 1996 increased mainly from an increase in
gross margin percentage to 38.5% from 35.1% and to a lesser extent from an
increase in net sales during the thirty-nine week period of the current year.
The 3.4% improvement in gross profit percentage resulted primarily from
increased levels of opportunistic and in-season purchases which created better
values for the Company's customers and lower markdowns.

Selling, general and administrative expense increased $266,000 to $17,913,000
(18.6% as a percentage of net sales) for the thirteen weeks ended November 30,
1996 as compared to $17,647,000 (18.9% as a percentage of net sales) for the
thirteen weeks ended November 25, 1995. Selling, general and administrative
expense increased $400,000 to $52,536,000 (20.6%) for the thirty-nine weeks
ended November 30, 1996 as compared to $52,136,000 (21.2%) for the thirty-nine
weeks ended November 25, 1995.

Advertising expense for the thirteen weeks ended November 30, 1996 decreased to
$2,410,000, as compared to $2,876,000 in the thirteen week period ended November
25, 1995. Advertising expense for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 30, 1996
decreased slightly to $5,293,000, as compared to $5,460,000 in the thirty-nine
week period ended November 25, 1995.

Occupancy costs were $3,666,000 (3.8% as a percentage of net sales) for the
thirteen week period ended November 30, 1996, up from $3,017,000 (3.2% as a
percentage of net sales) for the thirteen week period ended November 25, 1995.
Occupancy costs were $10,349,000 (4.1%) for the thirty-nine week period ended
November 30, 1996, up from $9,343,000 (3.8%) for the thirty-nine week period
ended November 25, 1995. The increases in both the thirteen and thirty-nine week
periods resulted from four additional leased locations this year.

Depreciation and amortization amounted to $2,034,000 for the thirteen week
period ended November 30, 1996, an increase of $87,000, as compared to
$1,947,000 for the thirteen weeks ended November 25, 1995. Depreciation and
amortization amounted to $5,864,000 for the thirty-nine week period ended
November 30, 1996, an increase of $51,000, as compared to $5,813,000 for the
thirty-nine weeks ended November 25, 1995.

                                                      --------------------------

The credit to the provision for special charges during the thirteen weeks ended
November 25, 1995 in the amount of $484,000 adjusted an amount previously
provided for store closing costs. The provision for special charges for the
thirty-nine weeks ended November 25, 1995 of $716,000 includes costs associated
with the store closings.

Income before income taxes for the thirteen weeks ended November 30, 1996 of
$15,287,000 increased $5,861,000 as compared to $9,426,000 for the thirteen
weeks ended November 25, 1995. Income before income taxes for the thirty-nine
weeks ended November 30, 1996 of $23,821,000 increased $11,384,000 as compared
to $12,437,000 for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 25, 1995. As discussed
above, the increase in income before income taxes, for the current year's
thirty-nine week period, reflects, for the most part, higher gross profit,
offset somewhat by increased selling, general and administrative expenses and
increased occupancy expense, and no special charges in the current period.

For the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended November 30, 1996 the
effective income tax rate was 43.5% as compared to 41.0% last year. Last year's
rate was favorably impacted by the recognition of certain tax reserves provided
for previous years that were no longer deemed necessary.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Working capital at November 30, 1996 was $72,870,000, an increase of $652,000
from $72,218,000 as of November 25, 1995, and the ratio of current assets to
current liabilities was 1.88 to 1 as compared to 2.13 to 1 at November 30, 1996
and November 25, 1995, respectively.

Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $17,667,000 for the
thirty-nine weeks ended November 30, 1996, an increase of $17,327,000 as
compared to $340,000 for the thirty-nine weeks ended November 25, 1995. Net
income for 1996 amounted to $13,459,000 compared to $7,338,000 in 1995, an
increase of $6,121,000.

Net cash used in investing activities was $20,028,000 and $2,352,000 for the
thirty-nine weeks ended November 30, 1996 and November 25, 1995, respectively.
Expenditures for property and equipment for the nine months ended November 30,
1996 ($20,078,000) include the cost of a new store in Pittsburgh, PA, a second
Manhattan store located on 54th Street, expanding the Secaucus, NJ distribution
center and costs associated with a Fall 1997 relocation of a leased store to an
owned store.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $2,101,000 for the thirty-nine
weeks ended November 30, 1996, compared to $2,365,000 in 1995. As of November
30, 1996 and November 25, 1995, the Company had net borrowings of $2,350,000 and
$4,625,000, respectively, under its revolving credit agreement.

The Company has a revolving credit agreement with a bank for a line of credit
not to exceed $40,000,000 through December 1, 1997. At December 1, 1997 the
Company has the option to reduce this commitment to zero or convert the
revolving credit agreement to a term loan with a maturity date of December 1,
2000. Except for funds provided from such credit agreement, the Company has
satisfied its operating and capital expenditure requirements, including those
for the opening and expansion of stores, from internally generated funds. For
the thirty-nine weeks ended November 30, 1996 under the revolving credit
agreement, the borrowings peaked at $21,450,000 and the average amount of
borrowings was $4,687,000 with a weighted average interest rate of 5.96%. For
the thirty-nine weeks ended November 25, 1995 borrowings under the revolving
credit agreement peaked at $16,135,000 and average borrowings were $4,596,000
with a weighted average interest rate of 7.33%.

The Company estimates that capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending March
1, 1997 will be approximately $23,000,000, including the opening of a new store
in Pittsburgh, PA, a second Manhattan store located on 54th Street, expanding
the Secaucus, New Jersey distribution center by 40,000 square feet and costs
associated with a Fall 1997 relocation of a leased store to an owned store.

                                                      --------------------------

Management believes that existing cash, internally generated funds, trade credit
and funds available from the revolving credit agreement will be sufficient for
working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the fiscal year ending
March 1, 1997.

IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

Although the Company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation
on its operations, it does not believe inflation has had a material effect on
sales or results of operations.
