       FOR
      THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2006 (unaudited)

1.  
             
                BASIS
                OF PRESENTATION  

The
      accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the
      accounts of Peregrine Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Peregrine ), a biopharmaceutical
      company with a broad portfolio of products under development, and its
      wholly-owned subsidiary, Avid Bioservices, Inc. ( Avid ), which performs
      contract manufacturing of biologics and related services (collectively, the
       Company ). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

In
      addition, the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements
      are unaudited; however they contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal
      recurring adjustments) which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to
      present fairly the condensed consolidated financial position of the Company
      at
      January 31, 2006, and the condensed consolidated results of our operations
      and
      our condensed consolidated cash flows for the three and nine month periods
      ended
      January 31, 2006 and 2005. We prepared the condensed consolidated financial
      statements following the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission
      (or SEC) for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules, certain
      footnotes or other financial information that are normally required by U.S.
      generally accepted accounting principles (or GAAP) can be condensed or omitted.
      Although we believe that the disclosures in the financial statements are
      adequate to make the information presented herein not misleading, the
      information included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q should be read in
      conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes
      included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2005.
      Results of operations for interim periods covered by this quarterly report
      on
      Form 10-Q may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations for the
      full fiscal year. 

As
      of
      January 31, 2006, we had $15,664,000 in cash and cash equivalents on hand.
      We
      have expended substantial funds on the development of our product candidates
      and
      we have incurred negative cash flows from operations for the majority of our
      years since inception. Since inception, we have generally financed our
      operations primarily through the sale of our common stock and issuance of
      convertible debt, which has been supplemented with payments received from
      various licensing collaborations and through the revenues generated by Avid.
      We
      expect negative cash flows from operations to continue until we are able to
      generate sufficient revenue from the contract manufacturing services provided
      by
      Avid and/or from the sale and/or licensing of our products under development.

Revenues
      earned by Avid during the nine months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 amounted
      to $2,227,000 and $3,983,000, respectively. We expect that Avid will continue
      to
      generate revenues which should lower consolidated cash flows used in operations,
      although we expect those near term revenues will be insufficient to fully cover
      anticipated cash flows used in operations. In addition, revenues from the sale
      and/or licensing of our products under development are always uncertain.
      Therefore, we expect we will continue to need to raise additional capital to
      continue the development of our product candidates, including the anticipated
      development and clinical costs of Tarvacin  and Cotara , the anticipated
      research and development costs associated with our other technology platforms
      and the potential expansion of our manufacturing capabilities. 

We
      plan
      to raise additional capital primarily through the registered offer and sale
      of
      shares of our common stock from our shelf registration statements on Form S-3,
      which, as of March 3, 2006, we had an aggregate of approximately 4,179,000
      shares available for possible future registered transactions. However, given
      uncertain market conditions and the volatility of our stock price and trading
      volume, we may not be able to sell our securities at prices or on terms that
      are
      favorable to us, if at all.

         NOTES
        TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

         FOR
        THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2006 (unaudited) (continued)

There
      can
      be no assurances that we will be successful in raising sufficient capital on
      terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that sufficient additional revenues will
      be generated from Avid or under potential licensing agreements to complete
      the
      research, development, and clinical testing of our product candidates. We
      currently have sufficient cash on hand, including anticipated amounts to be
      received from the exercise of outstanding warrants, to pay our anticipated
      obligations in the ordinary course of business, as estimated, through at least
      December 31, 2006.  

2.  
             
                SUMMARY
                OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Prepaid
      Expenses    -
      Our
      prepaid expenses primarily represent pre-payments made to secure the receipt
      of
      services at a future date. During fiscal years 2006 and 2005, we prepaid various
      research and development related services through the issuance of shares of
      our
      common stock to unrelated entities, which are expensed once the services have
      been provided under the terms of the arrangement. As of January 31, 2006 and
      April 30, 2005, prepaid expenses and other current assets include $483,000
      and
      $1,028,000, respectively, in research and development services prepaid in shares
      of our common stock. 

Inventories
      -   
      Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and primarily include
      raw
      materials, direct labor and overhead costs associated with our wholly-owned
      subsidiary, Avid. Inventories consist of the following at January 31, 2006
      and
      April 30, 2005: 

Comprehensive
      Loss   
      -
      Comprehensive loss is equal to net loss for all periods presented. 

Reclassification
      -   
      Certain
      amounts in fiscal year 2005 condensed consolidated financial statements have
      been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 

Basic
      and Dilutive Net Loss Per Common Share   
      - Basic
      and dilutive net loss per common share are calculated in accordance with
      Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128,    Earnings
      per Share   .
      Basic
      net loss per common share is computed by dividing our net loss by the weighted
      average number of common shares outstanding during the period excluding the
      dilutive effects of options and warrants. Diluted net loss per common share
      is
      computed by dividing the net loss by the sum of the weighted average number
      of
      common shares outstanding during the period plus the potential dilutive effects
      of options and warrants outstanding during the period calculated in accordance
      with the treasury stock method, but are excluded if their effect is
      anti-dilutive.  

The
      calculation of weighted average diluted shares outstanding excludes the dilutive
      effect of options and warrants to purchase up to   2,524,463
      and 2,997,181   shares
      of
      common stock for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2006,
      respectively, and   5,466,924
      and 7,074,278   shares
      of
      common stock for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2005,
      respectively, as the   impact
      of
      such options and warrants are anti-dilutive during periods of net
      loss  .

PEREGRINE
        PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.   

         NOTES
        TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

         FOR
        THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2006 (unaudited) (continued)

The
      calculation of weighted average diluted shares outstanding also excludes options
      and warrants to purchase up to 11,176,382 and 9,592,777 shares of common stock
      for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2006, respectively, and
      13,788,339 and 11,869,284 shares of common stock for the three and nine months
      ended January 31, 2005, respectively, as the exercise prices of those
      options was greater than the average market price of our common stock during
      the
      respective periods, resulting in an anti-dilutive effect.    

Stock-Based
      Compensation   
      - In
      December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued
      Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 ( SFAS No. 148 ),
   Accounting
      for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure   . 
      SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123 ( SFAS No. 123 ),    Accounting
      for Stock-Based Compensation   ,
      and
      provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair
      value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation.  In
      addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to
      require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements
      about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation, and the
      effect of the method used on reported results.  

We
      have
      not adopted a method under SFAS No. 148 to expense stock options, but rather
      we
      continue to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 123; however, we have adopted
      the
      additional disclosure provisions of the statement. As SFAS No. 123 permits,
      we
      elected to continue accounting for our employee stock options in accordance
      with
      Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 ( APB No. 25 ),    Accounting
      for Stock Issued to Employees and Related Interpretations   .
      APB No.
      25 requires compensation expense to be recognized for stock options when the
      market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock
      option on the date of the grant. 

We
      utilize the guidelines in APB No. 25 for measurement of stock-based transactions
      for employees and, accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized
      for
      the options in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements
      for
      the three and nine months ended January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005.

Had
      we
      used a fair value model for measurement of stock-based transactions for
      employees under SFAS No. 123 and amortized the expense over the vesting period,
      pro forma information would be as follows:

PEREGRINE
        PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.   

         NOTES
        TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

         FOR
        THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2006 (unaudited) (continued)

Stock-based
      compensation expense recorded during the three and nine months ended January
      31,
      2006 and January 31, 2005 relate to stock option grants issued to non-employee
      consultants. The fair value of these options are measured utilizing the
      Black-Scholes option valuation model and are being amortized over the estimated
      period of service or related vesting period in accordance with the provisions
      of
      SFAS No. 123 and EITF 96-18,    Accounting
      for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring,
      or
      in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services   .
      Stock-based compensation expense recorded during the three and nine months
      ended
      January 31, 2006 amounted to $200,000 and $361,000, respectively. Stock-based
      compensation expense recorded during the three and nine months ended January
      31,
      2005 amounted to $20,000 and $134,000, respectively.  

In
      December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      No.
      123R ( SFAS No. 123R ),    Share-Based
      Payment (Revised 2004)   ,
      which
      requires companies to recognize in the income statement the fair value of all
      employee share-based payments, including grants of employee stock options as
      well as compensatory employee stock purchase plans, for interim periods
      beginning after June 15, 2005. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange
      Commission adopted a rule amendment that delayed the compliance dates of SFAS
      No. 123R such that we are now allowed to adopt the new standard no later than
      May 1, 2006. SFAS No. 123R eliminates the ability to account for share-based
      compensation using APB No. 25, and the pro forma disclosures previously
      permitted under SFAS No. 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial
      statement recognition. We are evaluating the requirements under SFAS No. 123R
      including the valuation methods and support for the assumptions that underlie
      the valuation of the awards, as well as the transition methods (modified
      prospective transition method or the modified retrospective transition method)
      and expect the adoption to have a significant impact on our consolidated
      statements of operations and net loss per share and minimal impact on our
      consolidated statement of financial position. 

In
      addition, during August 2003, a member of our Board of Directors voluntarily
      cancelled an option to purchase shares of our common stock due to an
      insufficient number of stock options available in our stock option plans for
      new
      employee grants. During October 2003, we received stockholder approval for
      our
      2003 Stock Incentive Plan ( 2003 Plan ) and the director was re-granted options
      to purchase shares under the 2003 Plan. In accordance with FASB Interpretation
      No. 44 ( FIN No. 44 ),    Accounting
      for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation   ,
      the
      option granted to the director under the 2003 Plan is subject to variable
      accounting, which could result in an increase in compensation expense in
      subsequent periods if the market price of our common stock exceeds the original
      exercise price of the option until the date the option is exercised, forfeited,
      or expires unexercised. If the market price of our common stock decreases,
      then
      decreases in compensation expense would be recognized, limited to the net
      expense previously reported. During the three and nine months ended January
      31,
      2006 and January 31, 2005, we did not record compensation expense with respect
      to such option in accordance with FIN No. 44 since the market price of our
      stock

Recent
      Accounting Pronouncement   
      - In
      December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      No.
      153 ( SFAS No. 153 ),    Exchanges
      of Nonmonetary Assets - An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for
      Nonmonetary Transactions   .
      SFAS
      No. 153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary
      exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB Opinion No.
      29,
   Accounting
      for Nonmonetary Transactions   ,
      and
      replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial
      substance. SFAS No. 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial
      substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change
      significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for
      the fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005 and we would be required
      to adopt this standard no later than May 1, 2006. The adoption of SFAS No.
      153
      is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position
      and results of operations.

NOTE
                RECEIVABLE 

During
      December 1998, we completed the sale and subsequent leaseback of our two
      facilities in Tustin, California, and recorded an initial note receivable from
      the buyer of $1,925,000 as part of the consideration. During the quarter ended
      October 31, 1999, we established a 100% reserve for the note receivable in
      the
      amount of $1,887,000 based on the terms of the note agreement. We subsequently
      received all payments under the note agreement and reduced the reserve as
      payments were received and we recorded these payments as interest and other
      income in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.
      On
      December 22, 2005, we entered into a First Amendment to Lease and Agreement
      of
      Lease ( First Amendment ) with the landlord to our original lease dated December
      24, 1998 and extended the original lease term for seven additional years, which
      extends our contractual commitment under the operating lease through December
      2017. In addition, the monthly lease payment terms under the original lease,
      which increase at a rate of 3.35% every two years, were not modified under
      the
      First Amendment. In connection with this First Amendment, we entered into a
      separate agreement with the landlord on December 22, 2005 regarding the
      immediate payoff of our note receivable at a 20% discount in the amount of
      $1,229,000, which amount was recorded as interest and other income in the
      accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.

During
      fiscal years 2006 and 2005, we entered into the following note payable
      agreements with General Electric Capital Corporation ( GE ) to finance certain
      laboratory equipment. Notes payable consist of the following at January 31,
      2006
      and April 30, 2005: 

Under
      the
      terms of the GE note payable agreements, we paid security deposits equal to
      25%
      of the amount financed, which are due and payable to us at the end of the term
      of each note agreement. As of January 31, 2006 and April 30, 2005, security
      deposits totaling $276,000 and $183,000, respectively, are included in other
      long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated financial
      statements.

      in
      the amount of $65,000. The agreement bears interest at a rate of 6.30% per
      annum
      with payments due monthly in the amount of approximately $1,600 through December

                LITIGATION 

In
      the
      ordinary course of business, we are at times subject to various legal
      proceedings, including licensing and contract disputes and other matters, which
      are further discussed below: 

On
      December 16, 2004, we filed a lawsuit against the University of Southern
      California ( USC ) and Alan Epstein, M.D. The lawsuit was filed in the Superior
      Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles, Central
      District. The lawsuit alleges that USC has breached various agreements with
      the
      Company by (i) failing to protect the Company s patent rights in Japan with
      respect to certain technology exclusively licensed from USC due to non-payment
      of annuities, (ii) failing to provide accounting documentation for research
      expenditures, and (iii) misusing certain antibodies the Company provided to
      USC
      and Dr. Epstein for research. The claims against Dr. Epstein, who was a
      scientific advisor and former consultant to the Company, involve breach of
      contract for misusing certain antibodies and breach of fiduciary duties. The
      Company is seeking unspecified damages, declaratory relief with respect to
      its
      rights under the option and license agreement pursuant to which it acquired
      the
      rights to the technology, and an accounting of research expenditures.

On
      August
      3, 2005, USC filed a cross-complaint against the Company relating to the
      above-mentioned lawsuit. The cross-complaint alleged that the Company has
      breached various agreements with USC by (i) breaching reporting and diligence
      provisions of the option and license agreements, (ii) failing to make payments
      under a sponsored research agreement, and (iii) failing to exercise its rights
      under the product and option license agreement for hybridoma clones. USC sought
      unspecified punitive damages with respect to its rights under the option and
      license agreements and the sponsored research agreement. 

On
      September 30, 2004, we filed a lawsuit against Knobbe, Martens, Olson  
Bear, LLP and Joseph Reisman, of the law firm Knobbe, Martens, Olson   Bear,
      LLP ( Knobbe ), in San Diego Superior Court. This suit is related to USC s
      above-mentioned failure to protect patent rights in Japan. Accordingly, the
      case
      against Knobbe was dismissed in connection with receiving a tolling agreement
      extending the statute of limitations on our claims against the firm while USC
      pursued those claims. 

On
      March
      7, 2006, we reached a global settlement with USC, Dr. Epstein and Knobbe with
      respect to the matters set forth above. The settlement entails (i) relief from
      future minimum annual royalties due to USC under our Vasopermeation Enhancement
      Agent ( VEA ) licensing agreement, (ii) reduction in royalties due on net sales
      to USC with respect to our VEA license agreement, (iii) a release from USC
      of
      any claimed obligation for past sponsored research fees in the amount of
      $187,500, and (iv) consideration from Knobbe comprised of cash and a credit
      for
      future legal services.

Results
      of operations for interim periods covered by this quarterly report on Form
      10-Q
      may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations for the full fiscal
      year. 

Total
      Revenues.      

Three
      Months: The increase in total revenues of $175,000 during the three months
      ended
      January 31, 2006 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily
      due
      to an increase in contract manufacturing revenue of $171,000. The increase
      in
      contract manufacturing revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number
      of
      active projects associated with unrelated entities compared to the same
      three-month period in the prior year.  

Nine
      Months: The decrease in total revenues of $1,748,000 during the nine months
      ended January 31, 2006 compared to the same period in the prior year was
      primarily due to a decrease in contract manufacturing revenue of $1,756,000.
      The
      decrease in contract manufacturing revenue was primarily due to a decrease
      in
      the number of completed manufacturing runs associated with unrelated entities
      compared to the same nine-month period in the prior year. In addition, during
      the nine months ended January 31, 2006, we significantly increased our
      utilization of our manufacturing facility to manufacture clinical grade
      materials to support Peregrine s three active clinical trials and other products
      under development.  

18 

We
      expect
      to continue to generate contract manufacturing revenue during the remainder
      of
      the current fiscal year based on the anticipated completion of in-process
      customer related projects and the anticipated demand for Avid s services under
      outstanding proposals. Although Avid is presently working on several active
      projects for unrelated entities and has submitted project proposals with various
      potential customers, we cannot estimate nor can we determine the likelihood
      that
      we will be successful in completing these ongoing projects or converting any
      of
      these outstanding project proposals into definitive agreements during the
      remainder of fiscal year 2006. 

Cost
      of Contract Manufacturing     .

Three
      Months: The decrease in cost of contract manufacturing of $185,000 during the
      three months ended January 31, 2006 compared to the same period in the prior
      year was primarily related to a loss provision of $243,000 recorded in the
      prior
      year three-month period associated with a previous contract that did not recur
      in the current year period offset by an increase in cost of contract
      manufacturing primarily associated with the current year three-month period
      increase in contract manufacturing revenue.  

Nine
      Months: The decrease in cost of contract manufacturing of $1,445,000 during
      the
      nine months ended January 31, 2006 compared to the same period in the prior
      year
      was primarily related to the current nine-month period decrease in contract
      manufacturing revenue. We expect contract manufacturing costs to continue during
      the remainder of the current fiscal year based on the anticipated completion
      of
      customer projects under our current contract manufacturing
      agreements. 

Research
      and Development Expenses.      

Three
      Months: The increase in research and development expenses of $746,000 during
      the
      three months ended January 31, 2006 compared to the same period in the prior
      year was primarily due to a net increase in expenses associated with our
      following platform technologies under development:  

o  
             
                 Anti-Phospholipid
                Therapy (Tarvacin )    -       During
                the three months ended January 31, 2006, Anti-Phospholipid Therapy
                (Tarvacin ) program expenses increased $1,489,000 from $685,000 in fiscal
                year 2005 to $2,174,000 in fiscal year 2006. The increase in
                Anti-Phospholipid Therapy       (Tarvacin )
                program expenses is primarily due to an increase in manufacturing
                  and
                in-house antibody development expenses combined with an increase
                in
                various clinical trial expenses  
                to
                support two separate Phase I clinical studies using Tarvacin  for the
                treatment of advanced solid cancers and chronic hepatitis C virus
                infection. These increases were supplemented with an increase in
                sponsored
                research fees and payroll and related expenses associated with the
                Anti-Phospholipid Therapy development program. These increases were
                offset
                by a decrease in pre-clinical toxicology study expenses incurred
                in the
                prior year quarter to support the Investigational New Drug ( IND )
                applications, which was offset by a similar increase in outside animal
                research studies to support the possible expansion of Tarvacin  clinical
                trials in other anti-viral
                indications. 

o  
             
                 Vasopermeation
                Enhancements Agents ( VEAs )    -       During
                the three months ended January 31, 2006, VEA program expenses increased
                $32,000 from $78,000 in fiscal year 2005 to $110,000 in fiscal year
                2006.
                The increase in VEA program expenses is primarily due to an increase
                in
                resources focused on the VEA program compared to the prior year period.
                In
                January 2005, we entered into an agreement with Merck KGaA of Darmstadt,
                Germany, that will give us access to Merck's technology and expertise
                in
                protein expression to advance the development of our VEA technology
                and
                other platform technologies. Merck KGaA is presently working on a
                clinical
                candidate under the VEA technology
                platform. 

19 

o  
             
                 Tumor
                Necrosis Therapy ( TNT ) (Cotara )     -        During
                the three months ended January 31, 2006, TNT (Cotara ) program expenses
                decreased $571,000 from $1,212,000 in fiscal year 2005 to $641,000
                in
                fiscal year 2006. The decrease in TNT (Cotara ) program expenses is
                primarily due to a decrease in manufacturing, antibody development,
                and
                radiolabeling expenses incurred in the current quarter as the majority
                of
                in-house resources have recently been focused on the development
                of the
                Tarvacin  program.  

o  
             
                 Vascular
                Targeting Agents ( VTAs ) and Anti-Angiogenesis    -       During
                the three months ended January 31, 2006, VTA and Anti-Angiogenesis
                program
                expenses decreased $204,000 from $573,000 in fiscal year 2005 to
                $369,000
                in fiscal year 2006. The decrease in VTA and Anti-Angiogenesis program
                expenses is primarily due to a decrease in intellectual property
                access
                fees and sponsored research fees as our outside researchers are primarily
                focused on the development of
                Tarvacin . 

Nine
      Months: The increase in research and development expenses of $1,208,000 during
      the nine months ended January 31, 2006 compared to the same period in the prior
      year was primarily due to a net increase in expenses associated with our
      following platform technologies under development:  

o  
             
                 Anti-Phospholipid
                Therapy (Tarvacin )    -       During
                the nine months ended January 31, 2006, Anti-Phospholipid Therapy
                (Tarvacin ) program expenses increased $2,849,000 from $3,442,000 in
                fiscal year 2005 to $6,291,000 in fiscal year 2006. The increase
                in
                Anti-Phospholipid Therapy       (Tarvacin )
                program expenses is primarily due to an increase in manufacturing
                and
                in-house antibody development expenses combined with an increase
                in
                various clinical trial expenses to support two separate Phase I clinical
                studies using Tarvacin  for the treatment of advanced solid cancers and
                chronic hepatitis C virus infection. In addition, the increase in
                program
                expenses was supplemented with an increase in technology access fees
                associated with Tarvacin  Phase I clinical trial milestones achieved
                during the current nine month period in accordance with third party
                licensing agreements, an increase in sponsored research fees, and
                an
                increase in outside animal research studies to support the possible
                expansion of Tarvacin  clinical trials in other anti-viral indications.
                These increases were primarily offset by a decrease in pre-clinical
                toxicology study expenses incurred in the prior year to support the
                Tarvacin  Investigational New Drug ( IND ) applications that were filed in
                the prior fiscal year combined with a decrease in outside antibody
                development fees related to our humanized antibody in development
                and a
                decrease in intellectual property access
                fees. 

o  
             
                 Tumor
                Necrosis Therapy ( TNT ) (Cotara )   
                -
                During the nine months ended January 31, 2006, TNT (Cotara ) program
                expenses decreased $626,000 from $2,336,000 in fiscal year 2005 to
                $1,710,000 in fiscal year 2006. The decrease in TNT (Cotara ) program
                expenses is primarily due to a decrease in payroll and related expenses
                and radiolabeling process development expenses incurred in the same
                prior
                year period to support the initiation of the first part of the Cotara 
                Phase II/III registration trial for the treatment of brain cancer
                in
                collaboration with the New Approaches to Brain Tumor Therapy consortium,
                and to support other development programs associated with our TNT
                technology platform. These decreases were further supplemented by
                a
                decrease in technology access fees incurred in the same prior year
                period
                supporting the production of monoclonal antibodies for Cotara .

o  
             
                 Vascular
                Targeting Agents ( VTAs ) and Anti-Angiogenesis    -
                During the nine months ended January 31, 2006, VTA and Anti-Angiogenesis
                program expenses decreased $811,000 from $1,844,000 in fiscal year
                2005 to
                $1,033,000 in fiscal year 2006. The decrease in VTA and Anti-Angiogenesis
                program expenses is primarily due to a decrease in intellectual property
                access fees and sponsored research fees as our outside researchers
                are
                currently focused on the development of
                Tarvacin .

o  
             
                 Vasopermeation
                Enhancements Agents ( VEAs )    -       During
                the nine months ended January 31, 2006, VEA program expenses decreased
                $191,000 from $487,000 in fiscal year 2005 to $296,000 in fiscal
                year
                2006. The decrease in VEA program expenses is primarily due to a
                decrease
                in sponsored research fees, combined with a decrease in antibody
                development fees regarding expenses incurred in the prior year associated
                with a research study that was completed in the prior year. In January
                2005, we entered into an agreement with Merck KGaA of Darmstadt,
                Germany,
                that will give us access to Merck's technology and expertise in protein
                expression to advance the development of our VEA technology and other
                platform technologies. Merck KGaA is presently working on a clinical
                candidate under the VEA technology
                platform. 

We
      expect
      research and development expenses to increase over the near term primarily
      under
      the following ongoing research and development programs: 

1. 

Tarvacin 
                clinical studies for the treatment of solid tumors and chronic hepatitis
                C
                virus infection; 

2. 

Cotara 
                clinical study for the treatment of brain cancer in collaboration
                with New
                Approaches to Brain Tumor Therapy ( NABTT ), a brain tumor treatment
                consortium;  

3. 

Anti-Phospholipid
                Therapy research and development
                program; 

4. 

2C3
                (anti-angiogenesis antibody) research and development
                program; 

5. 

Vascular
                Targeting Agent research and development program;
                and 

6. 

Vasopermeation
                Enhancement Agent research and development
                program. 

The
      following represents the research and development expenses ( R D Expenses )
      we have incurred by each major technology platform under
      development: 

From
      inception to April 30, 1998, we expensed $20,898,000 on research and development
      of our product candidates, with the costs primarily being closely split between
      the TNT and prior developed technologies. In addition to the above costs, we
      expensed an aggregate of $32,004,000 for the acquisition of our TNT and VTA
      technologies, which were acquired during fiscal years 1995 and 1997,
      respectively.  

Looking
      beyond the current fiscal year, it is extremely difficult for us to reasonably
      estimate all future research and development costs associated with each of
      our
      technologies due to the number of unknowns and uncertainties associated with
      pre-clinical and clinical trial development. These unknown variables and
      uncertainties include, but are not limited to: 

The
                uncertainty of our capital resources to fund research, development
                and
                clinical studies beyond December 31, 2006;

The
                uncertainty of future costs associated with our pre-clinical candidates,
                including Vascular Targeting Agents, Anti-Angiogenesis Agents, and
                Vasopermeation Enhancement Agents, which costs are dependent on the
                success of pre-clinical development. We are uncertain whether or
                not these
                product candidates will be successful and we are uncertain whether
                or not
                we will incur any additional costs beyond pre-clinical development;

21 

The
                uncertainty of future clinical trial results;

The
                uncertainty of the ultimate number of patients to be treated in any
                clinical trial; 

The
                uncertainty of the Food and Drug Administration allowing our studies
                to
                move into and forward from Phase I clinical studies to Phase II and
                Phase
                III clinical studies;  

The
                uncertainty of the rate at which patients are enrolled into any current
                or
                future study. Any delays in clinical trials could significantly increase
                the cost of the study and would extend the estimated completion
                dates; 

The
                uncertainty of terms related to potential future partnering or licensing
                arrangements; and 

The
                uncertainty of protocol changes and modifications in the design of
                our
                clinical trial studies, which may increase or decrease our future
                costs. 

We
      or our
      potential partners will need to do additional development and clinical testing
      prior to seeking any regulatory approval for commercialization of our product
      candidates as all of our products are in discovery, pre-clinical or clinical
      development. Testing, manufacturing, commercialization, advertising, promotion,
      exporting, and marketing, among other things, of our proposed products are
      subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States
      and other countries. The testing and approval process requires substantial
      time,
      effort, and financial resources, and we cannot guarantee that any approval
      will
      be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Companies in the pharmaceutical and
      biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in conducting
      advanced human clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in
      earlier trials. Furthermore, the United States Food and Drug Administration
      may
      suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding
      that
      the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
      Even
      if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail
      limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed. Accordingly,
      we
      or our potential partners may experience difficulties and delays in obtaining
      necessary governmental clearances and approvals to market our products, and
      we
      or our potential partners may not be able to obtain all necessary governmental
      clearances and approvals to market our products. 

Selling,
      General and Administrative Expenses.    

Selling,
      general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related
      expenses, director fees, legal and accounting fees, investor and public relation
      fees, insurance, and other expenses relating to our general management,
      administration, and business development activities of the Company.

Three
      Months: The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $290,000
      during the three months ended January 31, 2006 compared to the same period
      in
      the prior year is primarily due to an increase in (i) payroll and related
      expenses of $236,000 from $537,000 in the prior three-month period to $773,000
      in the current three-month period primarily due to an increase in headcount
      across most corporate functions to support our increased operations, (ii) stock
      based compensation expense of $118,000 from nil in the comparative period in
      fiscal year 2005 primarily associated with the amortization of the fair value
      of
      warrants provided for business development services related to Avid s
      operations, (iii) travel and related expenses of $54,000 from $27,000 in fiscal
      year 2005 to $81,000 in fiscal year 2006 primarily associated with our
      participation in several investor conferences and non-deal marketing road shows
      over the past quarter and an increase in travel associated with business
      development. These increases in expenses were supplemented with incremental
      increases in public relation expenses, board fees, and other general corporate
      expenses. These increases in expenses were offset by a current quarter decrease
      in audit and accounting fees of $108,000 from $200,000 in fiscal year 2005
      to
      $92,000 in fiscal year 2006 primarily related to the implementation of Section
      404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in the prior year quarter combined with
      a
      decrease in legal fees of $107,000 from $205,000 in fiscal year 2005 to $98,000
      in fiscal year 2006 primarily pertaining to a decrease in general corporate
      matters and lawsuits described in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under Part
      II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings.  

22 

Nine
      Months: The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of
      $1,073,000 during the nine months ended January 31, 2006 compared to the same
      period in the prior year is primarily due to an increase in (i) payroll and
      related expenses of $412,000 from $1,671,000 in the prior nine-month period
      to
      $2,083,000 in the current nine-month period primarily due to an increase in
      headcount across most corporate functions to support our increased operations,
      (ii) stock based compensation expense of $161,000 from $82,000 in fiscal year
      2005 to $243,000 in fiscal year 2006 associated with the amortization of the
      fair value of options and warrants provided for business development and general
      corporate services, (iii) investor and public relation fees of $160,000 from
      $170,000 in fiscal year 2005 to $330,000 in fiscal year 2006 primarily due
      to
      services provided by public relation firms assisting the Company with its
      investor and public relations activities, whose services were not utilized
      in
      the same prior year period, (iv) travel and related expenses of $154,000 from
      $130,000 in fiscal year 2005 to $284,000 in fiscal year 2006 primarily
      associated with our participation in several investor conferences and non-deal
      marketing road shows over the past nine months combined with an increase in
      travel associated with business development and other corporate activities,
      (v)
      board fees of $114,000 from $200,000 in the prior nine-month period to $314,000
      in the current nine month period primarily due to an increase in the number
      of
      non-employee directors combined with an increase in the number of Company Board
      meetings, (vi) legal fees of $104,000 from $364,000 in fiscal year 2005 to
      $468,000 in fiscal year 2006 primarily pertaining to the general corporate
      matters and litigation matters described in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
      under Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings. The current period increases in
      general and administrative expense were supplemented with incremental increases
      in other general corporate expenses. 

Interest
      and Other Income.      

Three
      and
      Nine Months: The increase in interest and other income of $1,316,000 and
      $1,388,000 during the three and nine months ended January 31, 2006,
      respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year was primarily
      due
      to the recovery of a previously fully reserved note receivable in the amount
      of
      $1,229,000 during the current quarter combined with an increase in interest
      income as a result of a higher average cash balance on hand and higher
      prevailing interest rates during the current year compared to the same prior
      year periods. 

Critical
      Accounting Policies  

The
      methods, estimates, and judgments we use in applying our most critical
      accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our
      condensed consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and
      judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience
      and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
      Our
      experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying
      value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
      sources. Actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different
      assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results.
      We
      believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us, in that
      they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require
      our most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments in the preparation of
      our
      condensed consolidated financial statements:  

Revenue
      Recognition   .
      We
      currently derive revenues primarily from licensing agreements associated with
      Peregrine s technologies under development and from contract manufacturing
      services provided by Avid. We recognize revenues pursuant to Staff Accounting
      Bulletin No. 101,    Revenue
      Recognition in Financial Statements   ,
      as well
      as the recently issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,    Revenue
      Recognition   .
      These
      bulletins draw on existing accounting rules and provide specific guidance on
      how
      those accounting rules should be applied. Revenue is generally realized or
      realizable and earned when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
      (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the seller's
      price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectibility is
      reasonably assured.  

In
      addition, we comply with Financial Accounting Standards Board s Emerging Issues
      Task Force No. 00-21 ( EITF 00-21 ),    Revenue
      Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables   .
      In
      accordance with EITF 00-21, we recognize revenue for delivered elements only
      when the delivered element has stand-alone value and we have objective and
      reliable evidence of the fair value for each undelivered element. If the fair
      value of any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement
      cannot be objectively determined, revenue is deferred until all elements are
      delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively
      be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. 

23 

Revenues
      associated with licensing agreements primarily consist of nonrefundable up-front
      license fees and milestone payments. Revenues under licensing agreements are
      recognized based on the performance requirements of the agreement. Nonrefundable
      up-front license fees received under license agreements, whereby continued
      performance or future obligations are considered inconsequential to the relevant
      licensed technology, are generally recognized as revenue upon delivery of the
      technology. Milestone payments are generally recognized as revenue upon
      completion of the milestone assuming there are no other continuing obligations.
      Nonrefundable up-front license fees, whereby we have an ongoing involvement
      or
      performance obligation, are generally recorded as deferred revenue and generally
      recognized as revenue over the term of the performance obligation or relevant
      agreement. Under some license agreements, the obligation period may not be
      contractually defined. Under these circumstances, we must exercise judgment
      in
      estimating the period of time over which certain deliverables will be provided
      to enable the licensee to practice the license.  

Contract
      manufacturing revenues are generally recognized once the service has been
      provided and/or upon shipment of the product to the customer. We also record
      a
      provision for estimated contract losses, if any, in the period in which they
      are
      determined. 

In
      July
      2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) released Issue 99-19 ( EITF
      99-19 ),    Reporting
      Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent   .
      EITF
      99-19 summarized the EITF s views on when revenue should be recorded at the
      gross amount billed to a customer because it has earned revenue from the sale
      of
      goods or services, or the net amount retained (the amount billed to the customer
      less the amount paid to a supplier) because it has earned a fee or commission.
      In addition, the EITF released Issue 00-10 ( EITF 00-10 ),    Accounting
      for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs   ,
      and
      Issue 01-14 ( EITF 01-14 ),    Income
      Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for  Out-of-Pocket 
Expenses Incurred   .
      EITF
      00-10 summarized the EITF s views on how the seller of goods should classify in
      the income statement amounts billed to a customer for shipping and handling
      and
      the costs associated with shipping and handling. EITF 01-14 summarized the
      EITF s views on when the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses should be
      characterized as revenue or as a reduction of expenses incurred. Our revenue
      recognition policies are in compliance with EITF 99-19, EITF 00-10 and EITF
      01-14 whereby we record revenue for the gross amount billed to customers (the
      cost of raw materials, supplies, and shipping, plus the related handling mark-up
      fee) and record the cost of the amounts billed as cost of sales as we act as
      a
      principal in these transactions.  

Allowance
      for Doubtful Receivables   .     We
      continually monitor our allowance for all receivables. A considerable amount
      of
      judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables
      and we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based on factors that appear
      reasonable under the circumstances. 

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources   

As
      of
      January 31, 2006, we had $15,664,000 in cash and cash equivalents on hand.
      Although we have sufficient cash on hand to meet our current planned obligations
      through at least December 31, 2006, our development efforts are dependent on
      our
      ability to raise additional capital to support our future
      operations. 

We
      have
      expended substantial funds on the development of our product candidates and
      we
      have incurred negative cash flows from operations for the majority of our years
      since inception. Since inception, we have generally financed our operations
      primarily through the sale of our common stock and issuance of convertible
      debt,
      which has been supplemented with payments received from various licensing
      collaborations and through the revenues generated by Avid. We expect negative
      cash flows from operations to continue until we are able to generate sufficient
      revenue from the contract manufacturing services provided by Avid and/or from
      the sale and/or licensing of our products under development.  

24 

Revenues
      earned by Avid during the nine months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 amounted
      to $2,227,000 and $3,983,000, respectively. We expect that Avid will continue
      to
      generate revenues which should lower consolidated cash flows used in operations,
      although we expect those near term revenues will be insufficient to cover
      anticipated cash flows used in operations. In addition, revenues from the sale
      and/or licensing of our products under development are always uncertain.
      Therefore, we expect we will continue to need to raise additional capital to
      continue the development of our product candidates, including the anticipated
      development and clinical trial costs of Tarvacin  and Cotara , the anticipated
      research and development costs associated with our other technology platforms
      and the potential expansion of our manufacturing capabilities. 

We
      plan
      to raise additional capital primarily through the registered offer and sale
      of
      shares of our common stock from our shelf registration statements on Form S-3,
      which, as of March 3, 2006, we had an aggregate of approximately 4,179,000
      shares available for possible future registered transactions. However, given
      uncertain market conditions and the volatility of our stock price and trading
      volume, we may not be able to sell our securities at prices or on terms that
      are
      favorable to us, if at all.  

In
      addition to equity financing, we actively explore various other sources of
      funding, including possible debt financing and leveraging our many assets,
      including our intellectual property portfolio. Our broad intellectual property
      portfolio allows us to develop products internally while at the same time we
      are
      able to out-license certain areas of the technology which would not interfere
      with our internal product development efforts.  

There
      can
      be no assurances that we will be successful in raising sufficient capital on
      terms acceptable to us, or at all (from either debt, equity or the licensing,
      partnering or sale of technology assets and/or the sale of all or a portion
      of
      Avid), or that sufficient additional revenues will be generated from Avid or
      under potential licensing agreements to complete the research, development,
      and
      clinical testing of our product candidates beyond December 31, 2006.

Significant
      components of the changes in cash flows from operating, investing, and financing
      activities for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 compared to the same
      prior
      year period are as follows: 

Cash
      Used In Operating Activities   .
      Cash
      used in operating activities is primarily driven by changes in our net loss.
      However, cash used in operating activities generally differs from our reported
      net loss as a result of non-cash operating expenses or differences in the timing
      of cash flows as reflected by the changes in operating assets and liabilities.
      During the nine months ended January 31, 2006, cash used in operating activities
      increased $3,482,000 to $12,982,000 compared to $9,500,000 for the nine months
      ended January 31, 2005. The increase in cash used in operating activities was
      primarily related to the timing of cash flows as reflected in the changes in
      operating assets and payment or reduction of liabilities in the aggregate amount
      of $1,821,000, the amount of which was further supplemented by an increase
      of
      $1,661,000 in net cash used in operating activities after deducting non-cash
      expenses and adjustments to net loss and before considering the changes in
      operating assets and liabilities. This increase was primarily due to a decrease
      in contract manufacturing revenue combined with an increase in research and
      development expenses and selling, general and administrative
      expenses. 

The
      changes in operating activities as a result of non-cash operating expenses
      or
      differences in the timing of cash flows as reflected by the changes in operating
      assets and liabilities are as follows: 

25 

Cash
      Used In Investing Activities.   
      During
      the nine months ended January 31, 2006, net cash provided by investing
      activities amounted to $613,000 primarily due to the recovery of a note
      receivable in the amount of $1,229,000 offset by the purchase of property in
      the
      amount of $423,000 to support the expanded research efforts of Peregrine and
      the
      expanded services of Avid combined with an increase in other assets of $199,000.
      Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended January 31,
      2005
      was primarily due to the purchase of laboratory equipment to support our
      research efforts and the expanded services of Avid, combined with an increase
      in
      other assets related to security deposits paid to GE Capital Corporation on
      notes payable and installment payments made on a 1,000-liter bioreactor.

Cash
      Provided By Financing Activities.          
      Net cash
      provided by financing activities increased $12,128,000 to $18,217,000 for the
      nine months ended January 31, 2006 compared to net cash provided of $6,089,000
      for the nine months ended January 31, 2005. Cash provided by financing
      activities during the nine months ended January 31, 2006 was primarily due
      to
      proceeds received under four separate security purchase agreements whereby
      we
      sold and issued a total of 20,707,217 shares of our common stock in exchange
      for
      aggregate net proceeds of $17,975,000. Cash provided by financing activities
      during the nine months ended January 31, 2005 was primarily due to proceeds
      received from the sale of stock supplemented with proceeds received from the
      financing of property with GE Capital Corporation. 

Commitments

At
      January 31, 2006, we had no material capital commitments.  

Risk
      Factors of Our Company  

The
      biotechnology industry includes many risks and challenges. Our challenges may
      include, but are not limited to: uncertainties associated with completing
      pre-clinical and clinical trials for our technologies; the significant costs
      to
      develop our products as all of our products are currently in development,
      pre-clinical studies or clinical trials and no revenue has been generated from
      commercial product sales; obtaining additional financing to support our
      operations and the development of our products; obtaining regulatory approval
      for our technologies; complying with governmental regulations applicable to
      our
      business; obtaining the raw materials necessary in the development of such
      compounds; consummating collaborative arrangements with corporate partners
      for
      product development; achieving milestones under collaborative arrangements
      with
      corporate partners; developing the capacity to manufacture, market, and sell
      our
      products, either directly or indirectly with collaborative partners; developing
      market demand for and acceptance of such products; competing effectively with
      other pharmaceutical and biotechnological products; attracting and retaining
      key
      personnel; protecting intellectual property rights; and accurately forecasting
      operating and capital expenditures, other capital commitments, or clinical
      trial
      costs, and general economic conditions. A more detailed discussion regarding
      our
      industry and business risk factors can be found in our Annual Report on Form
      10-K for the year ended April 30, 2005, as filed with the Securities and
      Exchange Commission on July 14, 2005.

                AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
                RISK   

Changes
      in United States interest rates would affect the interest earned on our cash
      and
      cash equivalents. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at January 31,
      2006, a near-term change in interest rates, based on historical movements,
      would
      not materially affect the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments.
      Our
      debt instruments have fixed interest rates and terms and, therefore, a
      significant change in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect
      on
      our financial position or results of operations  .

                      CONTROLS
                    AND
                    PROCEDURES   

The
      Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
      Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
      as amended (the  Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information
      required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Exchange Act is
      recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
      in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
      communicated to our management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
      Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
      disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
      management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
      designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
      desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply
      its
      judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
      procedures.  

The
      Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
      participation of management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
      Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its
      disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 2006, the end of the period
      covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief
      Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that its disclosure
      controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as
      of
      January 31, 2006. 

There
      were no significant changes in the Company s internal controls over financial
      reporting, during the quarter ended January 31, 2006, that have materially
      affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal
      controls over financial reporting.   

PART

ITEM
              1.    
             
                  LEGAL
                PROCEEDINGS.   

In
      the
      ordinary course of business, we are at times subject to various legal
      proceedings, including licensing and contract disputes and other matters, which
      are further discussed below: 

On
      December 16, 2004, we filed a lawsuit against the University of Southern
      California ( USC ) and Alan Epstein, M.D. The lawsuit was filed in the Superior
      Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles, Central
      District. The lawsuit alleges that USC has breached various agreements with
      the
      Company by (i) failing to protect the Company s patent rights in Japan with
      respect to certain technology exclusively licensed from USC due to non-payment
      of annuities, (ii) failing to provide accounting documentation for research
      expenditures, and (iii) misusing certain antibodies the Company provided to
      USC
      and Dr. Epstein for research. The claims against Dr. Epstein, who was a
      scientific advisor and former consultant to the Company, involve breach of
      contract for misusing certain antibodies and breach of fiduciary duties. The
      Company is seeking unspecified damages, declaratory relief with respect to
      its
      rights under the option and license agreement pursuant to which it acquired
      the
      rights to the technology, and an accounting of research expenditures.

27 

On
      August
      3, 2005, USC filed a cross-complaint against the Company relating to the
      above-mentioned lawsuit. The cross-complaint alleged that the Company has
      breached various agreements with USC by (i) breaching reporting and diligence
      provisions of the option and license agreements, (ii) failing to make payments
      under a sponsored research agreement, and (iii) failing to exercise its rights
      under the product and option license agreement for hybridoma clones. USC sought
      unspecified punitive damages with respect to its rights under the option and
      license agreements and the sponsored research agreement. 

On
      September 30, 2004, we filed a lawsuit against Knobbe, Martens, Olson  
Bear, LLP and Joseph Reisman, of the law firm Knobbe, Martens, Olson   Bear,
      LLP ( Knobbe ), in San Diego Superior Court. This suit is related to USC s
      above-mentioned failure to protect patent rights in Japan. Accordingly, the
      case
      against Knobbe was dismissed in connection with receiving a tolling agreement
      extending the statute of limitations on our claims against the firm while USC
      pursued those claims. 

On
      March
      7, 2006, we reached a global settlement with USC, Dr. Epstein and Knobbe with
      respect to the matters set forth above. The settlement entails (i) relief from
      future minimum annual royalties due to USC under our Vasopermeation Enhancement
      Agent ( VEA ) licensing agreement, (ii) reduction in royalties due on net sales
      to USC with respect to our VEA license agreement, (iii) a release from USC
      of
      any claimed obligation for past sponsored research fees in the amount of
      $187,500, and (iv) consideration from Knobbe comprised of cash and a credit
      for
      future legal services.

I,

      W. King, certify that: 

1. 
      I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Peregrine Pharmaceuticals,
      Inc.; 

2. 
      Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
      a
      material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
      made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made,
      not
      misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 

3. 
      Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information
      included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial
      condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and
      for, the periods presented in this report; 

4. 
      The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing
      and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
      Act
      Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting
      (as
      defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the
      registrant and have: 

a)
      designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure
      controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that
      material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated
      subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly
      during the period in which this report is being prepared; 

b)    designed
      such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control
      over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide
      reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
      preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
      generally accepted accounting principles; 

c) 
      evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and
      procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness
      of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the periods covered
      by this report based on such evaluation; and 

d) 
      disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over
      financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal
      quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report)
      that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
      the
      registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and  

5. 
      The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our
      most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the
      registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of
      directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 

a) 
      all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
      of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
      adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and
      report financial information; and  

b)  any
      fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
      who
      have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial
      reporting.
