NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

For the Three Month Period Ended December 31, 2005 

(Unaudited) 

Unless the context otherwise requires,     we   ,      us   ,      our     and     the Company     refer to the business
of Rock-Tenn Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, including RTS Packaging, LLC, which we
refer to as     RTS     and GSD Packaging, LLC , which we refer to as     GSD   .  We own 65% of RTS and
conduct our interior packaging products business through RTS. We own 60% of GSD and conduct some
of our folding carton operations through GSD. These terms do not include Seven Hills Paperboard,
LLC, which we refer to as     Seven Hills   .  We own 49% of Seven Hills, a manufacturer of gypsum
paperboard liner, which we do not consolidate for purposes of our financial statements. All
references in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q to aggregated data regarding sales price per ton and fiber, energy, chemical
and freight costs with respect to our recycled paperboard mills excludes that data with respect to
our Aurora, Illinois, recycled paperboard mill. We exclude that data because the Aurora operation
sells only converted products. All other references herein to other operating data with respect to
our recycled paperboard mills, including tons data and capacity utilization rates, includes
operating data from our Aurora recycled paperboard mill. 

Note 1. Interim Financial Statements 

Our independent registered public accounting firm has not audited our accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements. We derived the condensed consolidated balance sheet at
September 30, 2005 from the audited consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of our
management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are of a
normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of our results of operations for the
three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, our financial position at December 31, 2005 and
September 30, 2005, and our cash flows for the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.

We have condensed or omitted certain notes and other information from the interim financial
statements presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Therefore, these condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 (the   Fiscal 2005 Form 10-K  ).

The results for the three months ended December 31, 2005 are not necessarily indicative of results
that may be expected for the full year.

We have made certain reclassifications to prior year amounts to conform such amounts to the current
year presentation.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see    Note 1. Description of Business and
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
section of our Fiscal 2005 Form 10-K. As of the date hereof, there have been no significant
developments with respect to significant accounting policies since September 30, 2005.

Note 3. New Accounting Standards 

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 151,   Inventory Costs   an amendment of ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4   issued in November 2004 was adopted by us on October 1, 2005 (  SFAS 151  ). SFAS 151
requires us to recognize abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and
wasted material (spoilage) as current-period charges and to base our allocation of fixed production
overheads to the costs of conversion on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The
adoption of SFAS 151 did not have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial
statements.

We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),   Share-Based
Payment   on October 1, 2005, see    Note 8. Share-Based Compensation    below.

Note 4. Comprehensive Income (Loss) 

The following are the components of comprehensive income (loss) (in thousands):

The change in other comprehensive income due to foreign currency translation was primarily due
to the change in the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rates and the repatriation of a portion of the
capital invested in our Canadian operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 at an exchange rate
of 1.174. The numbers that follow are the Canadian dollar equivalent of one U.S. dollar. The
first quarter of fiscal 2006 was impacted as the exchange rate moved to 1.1628 at December 31, 2005
from 1.1624 at September 30, 2005. The first quarter of fiscal 2005 was impacted as the exchange
rate moved to 1.1995 at December 31, 2004 from 1.2614 at September 30, 2004.

Note 5. Earnings (Loss) per Share 

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (in
thousands, except per share data):

Due to the net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2005, the assumed net exercise of stock
options and restricted stock awards was excluded, as the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
Options and restricted stock awards for 3.9 million and 0.5 million shares of common stock,
respectively, were excluded because their effect was anti-dilutive. If we did not have a loss in
the period, approximately 0.6 million shares of dilutive stock options and restricted stock awards
would have been included in the denominator for the three months ended December 31, 2005.

Note 6. Acquisitions, Restructuring and Other Costs 

Summary of Acquisitions  

On June 6, 2005, we acquired from Gulf States Paper Corporation and certain of its related entities
(  Gulf States  ), substantially all of the assets of Gulf States  Pulp and Paperboard and Paperboard
Packaging (  GSPP  ) operations and assumed certain of Gulf States  related liabilities. We refer to
this transaction collectively as the   GSPP Acquisition  . We have included the results of GSPP s
operations in our condensed consolidated financial statements since that date.

Table of Contents   

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) (Continued)

The following unaudited pro forma information reflects our consolidated results of operations as if
the GSPP Acquisition had taken place on October 1, 2004. The pro forma information includes
primarily adjustments for depreciation based on the estimated fair value of the property, plant and
equipment we acquired, amortization of acquired intangibles and interest expense on the debt we
incurred to finance the acquisition. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of
the results of operations that we would have reported had the transaction actually occurred at the
beginning of fiscal 2005 nor is it necessarily indicative of future results. Pro forma information
in the table below is for the three months ended December 31, 2004.

Summary of Restructuring and Other Initiatives  

On October 4, 2005, we announced the closure of our Marshville, North Carolina folding carton
plant. We transferred the majority of the facility s production to our other folding carton
facilities. We recognized an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the equipment
retired from service to its estimated fair value less cost to sell and have classified the facility
and equipment as held for sale.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we announced the closure of our Waco, Texas folding carton
plant that we acquired as part of the GSPP Acquisition. We transferred the majority of the
facility s production to other plants. We classified the land and building as held for sale and we
recorded a liability for $1.5 million primarily for severance and other employee related costs as
part of the purchase.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we announced the closure of our Otsego, Michigan paperboard
mill. We transferred approximately one third of the production of this facility to our remaining
mills and recognized an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the facility and certain
equipment to its estimated fair value.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we announced the closure of our Dallas, Texas, laminated
paperboard products facility. We consolidated the operations of this plant into other existing
facilities. We recognized an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the equipment
retired from service to its estimated fair value less cost to sell. We have disposed of
substantially all of this equipment and the facility is classified as held for sale.

adjustments to fair value for assets classified as held for sale, subsequent (gains) or losses
on sales of property, plant and equipment, and property, plant and equipment related parts and
supplies. 

Fiscal 2006  

We recorded aggregate pre-tax restructuring and other costs of $1.0 million for the first quarter
of fiscal 2006. We incurred pre-tax charges of $0.5 million at our Marshville facility primarily
for severance and other employee costs. We recorded additional pre-tax charges aggregating $0.5
million primarily for GSPP transition costs and additional costs related to our Waco facility
closure.

severance and other employee costs, pre-tax charges of $0.4 million for closure costs at our Otsego
facility, and a $0.7 million gain from the sale of our Wright City laminated paperboard plant.

Note 7. Tax Provision 

The first quarter of fiscal 2006 includes deferred income tax expense of $1.4 million from a tax
law change in Quebec. The first quarter of fiscal 2005 tax provision is higher then normal due to
an adjustment of $0.6 million related to the acquisition of the Athens corrugator. We
originally recorded this adjustment as a reduction of tax expense in the year ended September 30,
2004.

Note 8. Share-Based Compensation 

We maintain a share-based compensation plan which allows for the issuance of nonqualified stock
options and restricted shares. We also maintain an employee stock purchase plan that provides for
the issuance of shares to all of our eligible employees at a discounted price. Prior to fiscal
year 2006, we accounted for the plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,   Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees   (  APB 25  ),
and related Interpretations. Accordingly, because all stock options granted had an exercise price
equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant, no expense
related to employee stock options was recognized. Also, as the employee stock purchase plan was
considered noncompensatory, no expense related to this plan was recognized. However, expense
related to the grant of restricted stock had been recognized in the income statement under APB 25.
Effective October 1, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123(R),   Share-Based Payment   (  FAS 123(R)  ). This
statement applies to all awards granted after the effective date and to modifications, repurchases
or cancellations of existing awards. We chose the modified prospective method of adoption in which
we recognize compensation expense for the portion of outstanding awards on the adoption date for
which the requisite service period that has not yet been rendered based on the grant-date fair
value of those awards calculated under SFAS No. 123,   Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation   and
SFAS No. 148,   Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation   Transition and Disclosure   an amendment
of FASB Statement No. 123 ,  for pro forma disclosures. Compensation expense in fiscal year 2005
related to stock options and the employee stock purchase plan continues to be disclosed on a pro
forma basis only. Also during the current quarter, in accordance with the modified prospective
transition method, we eliminated its balance of Deferred Compensation, which represented
unrecognized compensation cost for restricted stock awards. Financial statements for prior periods
have been restated.

FAS 123(R) requires that forfeitures be estimated over the vesting period of an award, rather than
being recognized as a reduction of compensation expense when the forfeiture actually occurs. The
only share-based compensation that was recognized in our financial statements prior to adoption of
FAS 123(R) was related to grants of restricted stock. The cumulative effect of the use of the
estimated forfeiture method for prior periods upon adoption of FAS 123(R) related to the restricted
shares was not material.

For the pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share we recognize compensation
cost over the explicit service period (up to the date of actual retirement). Upon adoption of SFAS
123(R), we are required to recognize compensation cost over a period to the date the employee first
becomes eligible for retirement for awards granted or modified after the adoption of SFAS 123(R).
Awards outstanding prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) will continue to be recognized over the
explicit service period. Had we followed the nonsubstantive vesting provisions of Statement 123(R),
the impact on pro forma net income and pro forma diluted earnings per share would have been  de
minimis .

We estimate, at the date of grant, the fair values for the options we granted using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model. During the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, there were no new
grants of stock options.

Stock Option Plans  

Our 2004 Incentive Stock Plan, approved by our shareholders in January 2005, allows for the
granting of options to certain key employees for the purchase of a maximum of 2,000,000 shares of
common stock plus the number of shares which would remain available for issuance under each
preexisting plan if shares were issued on the effective date of this plan sufficient to satisfy
grants then outstanding, plus the number of shares of Stock subject to grants under any preexisting
plan which are outstanding on the effective date of this plan and which are forfeited or expire on
or after such effective date. Our 2000 Incentive Stock Plan, approved in January 2001, allowed for
the granting of options through January 2005 to certain key employees for the purchase of a maximum
of 2,200,000 shares of common stock. Our 1993 Stock Option Plan allowed for the granting of options
through November 2003 to certain key employees for the purchase of a maximum of 3,700,000 shares of
common stock. Options that we granted under these plans vest in increments over a period of up to
three years and have ten-year terms.

The table below summarizes the changes in all stock options during the three months ended December
31, 2005:

Our results of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, includes $0.1 million (net of $0.1
million in income taxes) of compensation expense for stock options. The aggregate intrinsic value
of options exercised during the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $0.1 million and
$0.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, there was $0.2 million of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to nonvested stock options; that cost is expected to be recognized over a
period of 2.25 years.

SFAS 123(R) requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost
be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under prior
guidance. Excess tax benefits of approximately $0.1 million were included in cash provided by
financing activities for the quarter ended December 31, 2005.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) (Continued)

There were no grants, forfeitures, or vesting of restricted stock awards during the first quarter
of fiscal 2006. As of December 31, 2005, we had 508,831 unvested restricted shares outstanding with
a weighted average fair value of $13.55. There was approximately $3.3 million of unrecognized
compensation cost related to these unvested restricted shares that will be recognized over a
weighted average remaining contractual life of 8.15 years. Unless vested (pursuant to net income
performance criteria) or forfeited (e.g., by termination of employment) at an earlier date, the
awards of restricted common stock will vest in one-third annual increments beginning on the third
year from the date of grant and may not be transferred before they are vested. The restricted stock
awards granted to employees in fiscal 2005 are also subject to earlier vesting upon satisfaction of
specified performance criteria. The shares subject to these restricted stock awards will vest early
as follows: (1) one-third on March 31, 2006, for net income growth as compared to the base period
(the 12 months ended March 31, 2005) of at least 20% during the 12 months ending March 31, 2006
(including excess amounts from subsequent periods); (2) another one-third on March 31, 2007, for
net income growth as compared to the base period of at least 32% during the 12 months ending on
March 31, 2007 (including excess amounts from prior or subsequent periods); and (3) the final
one-third on March 31, 2008, for net income growth as compared to the base period of at least 45.2%
during the 12 months ending on March 31, 2008 (including excess amounts from prior periods). The
restricted stock awards granted to employees in fiscal 2004 are also subject to earlier vesting
upon satisfaction of specified performance criteria. The shares subject to these restricted stock
awards will vest early as follows: (1) one-third on March 31, 2005, for net income growth as
compared to the base period (the 12 months ended March 31, 2004) of at least 10% during the 12
months ending March 31, 2005 (including excess amounts from subsequent periods); (2) another
one-third on March 31, 2006, for net income growth as compared to the base period of at least 21%
during the 12 months ending on March 31, 2006 (including excess amounts from prior or subsequent
periods); and (3) the final one-third on March 31, 2007, for net income growth as compared to the
base period of at least 33.1% during the 12 months ending on March 31, 2007 (including excess
amounts from prior periods). The restricted stock awards granted to employees in fiscal 2003 and
2002 are also subject to earlier vesting upon satisfaction of specified performance criteria. The
shares subject to these restricted stock awards will vest early as follows: (1) one-third on the
first March 31 after the award date for net income growth as compared to the base period (12 months
ended March 31 of the fiscal year including the award date) in excess of 15% during 12 months
ending on the first March 31 after the award date (including excess amounts from subsequent
periods); (2) another one-third on the second March 31 after the award date for net income growth
as compared to the base period in excess of 32.5% during 12 months ending on the second March 31
after the award date (including excess amounts from prior or subsequent periods); and (3) the final
one-third on the third March 31 after the award date for net income growth as compared to the base
period in excess of 52% during 12 months ending on the third March 31 after the award date
(including excess amounts from prior periods). The measurement date for the fiscal periods that
follow is March 31. The early vesting provisions related to fiscal 2003 for the restricted stock
a
wards granted in fiscal 2002 and 2001 have not yet been satisfied. The early vesting provisions
related to fiscal 2004 for the restricted stock awards granted in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 have
not yet been satisfied. The early vesting provisions related to fiscal 2005 for the restricted
stock awards granted in fiscal 2004 and 2003 have not yet been satisfied.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan  

Under the Amended and Restated 1993 Employee Stock Purchase Plan  (the  Plan ) , shares of common
stock are reserved for purchase by substantially all of our qualifying employees. In January 2004,
our board of directors amended the Plan to allow for the purchase of an additional 1,000,000
shares, bringing the total authorized to a maximum of 3,320,000 shares of common stock. During the
three months ended December 31, 2005, employees purchased approximately 85,000 shares under the
Plan. We recognized $0.2 million in expense relating to the plan. As of December 31, 2005, 489,000
shares of common stock were available for purchase under this plan.

Note 9. Inventories 

We state substantially all of our U.S. inventories at the lower of cost or market, with cost
determined on the last-in, first-out (  LIFO  ) basis. We value all other inventories at the lower
of cost or market and determine cost using methods that approximate cost computed on a first-in,
first-out (  FIFO  ) basis. Because LIFO is designed for annual determinations, it is possible to
make an actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method only at the end of each fiscal year
based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, we base interim LIFO estimates
on management s projection of expected year-end inventory levels and costs.

Inventories were as follows (in thousands):

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) (Continued)

For a discussion of certain of our debt characteristics see    Note 8. Debt    of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements section of the Fiscal 2005 Form 10-K. Other than the items noted
below, there have been no significant developments.

(a)  
       
      The Senior Credit Facility includes revolving credit, swing, and term loan
facilities in the aggregate principal amount of $700 million. The Senior Credit Facility is
pre-payable at any time and is scheduled to expire on June 6, 2010. At December 31, 2005, we
had aggregate outstanding letters of credit under this facility of approximately $44 million.
At December 31, 2005, due to the restrictive covenants on the revolving credit facility,
maximum additional available borrowings under this facility were approximately $68 million.
The applicable margin for determining the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans ranges
from 0.000% to 0.750% of the aggregate borrowing availability based on the ratio of our
consolidated funded debt to Credit Agreement EBITDA. The applicable percentage for determining
the facility commitment fee ranges from 0.175% to 0.400% of the aggregate borrowing
availability based on the ratio of our consolidated funded debt to Credit Agreement EBITDA. At
December 31, 2005, the applicable margin for determining the interest rate applicable to LIBOR
Loans and the applicable margin for determining the interest rate applicable to Base Rate
Loans were 1.75% and 0.75%, respectively. At September 30, 2005, the applicable margin for
determining the interest rate applicable to LIBOR Loans and the applicable margin for
determining the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans were 1.50% and 0.50%,
respectively. The facility commitment fee at December 31, 2005 and September 30, 2005 was
0.40% and 0.325% of the unused amount, respectively. 

(b)  
       
      On October 26, 2005, we increased the receivables-backed financing facility
(  Receivables Facility  ) from $75.0 to $100.0 million. The new facility is scheduled to expire
on October 25, 2006. Borrowing availability under this facility is based on the eligible
underlying receivables. At December 31, 2005, we had drawn the
maximum available under this facility.
The borrowing rate, which consisted of a daily commercial paper rate plus a fee for the used
portion of the facility, was 4.63% as of December 31, 2005. The borrowing rate at September
30, 2005 was 4.10%. 

Interest on our 8.20% notes due August 2011 is payable in arrears each February and August.
Interest on our 5.625% notes due March 2013 is payable in arrears each September and March. Our
August 2011 and March 2013 notes are unsecured facilities. The indenture related to these notes
restricts us and our subsidiaries from incurring certain liens and entering into certain sale and
leaseback transactions, subject to a number of exceptions. Three of our Canadian subsidiaries had
revolving credit facilities with Canadian banks. The facilities provided borrowing availability of
up to $10.0 million Canadian. At September 30, 2005, and at the time we terminated these
facilities in December 2005, there were no amounts outstanding under these facilities.

Interest Rate Swaps  

We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term and long-term debt. We
use interest rate swap instruments to manage the interest rate characteristics of a portion of our
outstanding debt. In June and September 2005, we entered into $350.0 million notional amount and
$75.0 million notional amount of floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps, respectively, and
designated them as cash flow hedges of a like amount of our floating rate debt. The amount of
ineffectiveness recorded in the results of operations for the three month periods ended December
31, 2005 and 2004 was minimal. The fair value of the swaps was a deferred gain of $7.5 million at
December 31, 2005.

Note 11. Retirement Plans 

The following table represents a summary of the components of net pension cost (in thousands):

During the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we made no voluntary contributions to our
five defined benefit pension plans. We have no required minimum contributions for fiscal 2006. We
currently expect to contribute approximately $35 million to our pension plans over the next two
fiscal years.

The Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (  SERP  ) is designed to supplement a participant s
benefit under our pension plan for a relatively small number of participants. In November 2005 the
plan was amended to provide that the benefit will be paid as a lump sum for participants whose
employment terminates on or after November 11, 2005.

The Supplemental Retirement Savings Plan was modified in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 to
include a subplan covering certain highly compensated employees who have their contributions to
their 401K plan restricted due to the nondiscrimination testing results. Eligible subplan
participants can contribute up to a designated unmatched dollar amount on a pre-tax basis.

Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies 

Environmental and Other Matters  

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations,
including, among others, CERCLA, the Clean Air Act (as amended in 1990), the Clean Water Act, the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act. These environmental
regulatory programs are primarily administered by the US Environmental Protection Agency. In
addition, some states in which we operate have adopted equivalent or more stringent environmental
laws and regulations or have enacted their own parallel environmental programs, which are enforced
through various state administrative agencies.

We believe that future compliance with these environmental laws and regulations will not have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However,
our compliance and remediation costs could increase materially. In addition, we cannot currently
assess with certainty the impact that the future emissions standards and enforcement practices
associated with changes to regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act will have on our
operations or capital expenditure requirements. However, we believe that any such impact or capital
expenditures will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
condition or cash flows. See    Business   Forward-Looking Information     and     Risk Factors    in our
Fiscal 2005 Form 10-K.

We estimate that we will spend approximately $4.0 million for capital expenditures during fiscal
2006 in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance. Additionally, to comply with
emissions regulations under the Clean Air Act, we may be required to modify or replace a coal-fired
boiler at one of our facilities, the cost of which we estimate would be approximately $2.0 to $3.0
million. If necessary, we anticipate that we will incur those costs before the end of fiscal 2007.

We have been identified as a potentially responsible party (  PRP  ) at 10 active  superfund  sites
pursuant to Superfund legislation. Based upon currently available information and the opinions of
our environmental

14

Table of Contents   

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) (Continued)

compliance managers and general counsel, although there can be no assurance, we have reached the
following conclusions with respect to these ten sites:

With respect to each of two sites, while we have been identified as a PRP, our records
reflect no evidence that we are associated with the site. Accordingly, if we are
considered to be a PRP, we believe that we should be categorized as an unproven PRP. 

With respect to each of eight sites, we preliminarily determined that, while we may be
associated with the site and while it is probable that we have incurred a liability with
respect to the site, one of the following conclusions was applicable: 

With respect to each of six sites, we determined that it was appropriate to conclude
that, while it was not estimable, the potential liability was reasonably likely to be a
 de minimis  amount and immaterial. 

With respect to each of two sites, we have preliminarily determined that it was
appropriate to conclude that the potential liability was best reflected by a range of
reasonably possible liabilities, all of which we expect to be  de minimis  and
immaterial. 

Except as stated above, we can make no assessment of any potential for our liability with respect
to any such site. Further, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to conduct some
remediation in the future at any such site and that such remediation will not have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We believe that we
can assert claims for indemnification pursuant to existing rights we have under settlement and
purchase agreements in connection with certain of these sites. There can be no assurance that we
will be successful with respect to any claim regarding such indemnification rights or that, if we
are successful, any amounts paid pursuant to such indemnification rights will be sufficient to
cover all costs and expenses.

Guarantees  

We have made the following guarantees to unconsolidated third parties as of December 31, 2005:

We have a 49% ownership interest in Seven Hills, a joint venture. The partners of the
joint venture guarantee funding of net losses in proportion to their share of ownership. 

We lease certain manufacturing and warehousing facilities and equipment under various
operating leases. A substantial number of these leases require us to indemnify the lessor
in the event that additional taxes are assessed due to a change in the tax law. We are
unable to estimate our maximum exposure under these leases because it is dependent on
changes in the tax law. 

Over the past several years, we have disposed of assets and subsidiaries and have assigned
liabilities pursuant to asset and stock purchase agreements. These agreements contain various
representations and warranties relating to matters such as title to assets; accuracy of financial
statements; legal proceedings; contracts; employee benefit plans; compliance with environmental
law; patent and trademark infringement; taxes; and products, as well as various covenants. These
agreements may also provide specific indemnities for breaches of representations, warranties, or
covenants and may contain specific indemnification provisions. These indemnification provisions
address a variety of potential losses, including, among others, losses related to liabilities other
than those assumed by the buyer and liabilities under environmental laws. These indemnification
provisions may be affected by various conditions and external factors. Many of the indemnification
provisions issued or modified before December 31, 2002 have expired either by operation of law or
as a result of the terms of the agreement. We have not recorded any liability for the
indemnifications issued or modified before December 31, 2002, and are not aware of any claims or
other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities. Because of the
lapse of time, or the fact that the parties have resolved certain issues, we are not aware of any
outstanding indemnities issued or modified before December 31, 2002, the potential exposure for
which we estimate would have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or
cash flows. Under the terms of the agreements that were issued or modified after December 31,
2002, our specified maximum aggregate potential liability on an undiscounted basis is approximately
$6.0 million, other than with respect to certain specified liabilities, including liabilities
relating to environmental matters, with respect to which there is no limitation. We estimate our
aggregate liability for outstanding indemnities entered into after December 31, 2002, including the
indemnities described above with

15

Table of Contents   

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) (Continued)

respect to which there are no limitations, to be approximately $0.1 million. Accordingly, we have
recorded a liability for that amount.

Insurance Placed with Kemper  

During fiscal years 1985 through 2002, Kemper Insurance Companies/Lumbermens Mutual provided us
with workers  compensation insurance, auto liability insurance and general liability insurance.
Kemper has made public statements that they are uncertain that they will be able to pay all of
their claims liabilities in the future. At present, based on public comments made by Kemper, we
believe it is reasonably possible they will not be able to pay some or all of the future
liabilities associated with our open and reopened claims. However, we cannot reasonably estimate
the amount that Kemper may be unable to pay. Additionally, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact
of state guarantee funds and any facultative and treaty reinsurance that may be available to pay
such liabilities. If Kemper is ultimately unable to pay such liabilities, we believe the range of
our liability is between approximately $0 and $4 million and we are unable to estimate the
liability more specifically because of the factors described above. There can be no assurance that
any associated liabilities we may ultimately incur will not be material to our results of
operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Note 13. Segment Information 

The following table shows certain operating data for our three segments (in thousands). We do not
allocate certain of our income and expenses to our segments and, thus, the information that
management uses to make operating decisions and assess performance does not reflect such amounts.
We report these items as non-allocated expenses. These items include restructuring and other costs
and certain corporate expenses.

PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

Item 2.  
       
       MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS   

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto, included herein and audited consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, as well as the information under the
heading    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  , 
that are part of our Fiscal 2005 Form 10-K, which we filed with the SEC on December 19, 2005. The
table in    Note 13. Segment Information    of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements section of the Financial Statements included herein shows certain operating data for our
three segments.

Overview 

We expected the first quarter of fiscal 2006 results to be materially lower than the first quarter
of last year. The decline in earnings per share was primarily due to the increase in natural gas
prices following Hurricane Katrina. Higher energy costs, primarily in our paperboard mills,
reduced operating income by $10.7 million or $0.18 per diluted shared. Our annual maintenance
shutdown at our bleached paperboard mill during the quarter reduced our quarterly earnings and has
the effect of amplifying the seasonal weakness of our first quarter. Operating income was reduced
by our Waco, Texas and Marshville, North Carolina folding carton facilities losses that were
incurred while they were in the process of closure, and by increased Sarbanes-Oxley compliance
costs and audit fees. Losses in the quarter also include deferred income tax expense of $1.4
million due to a tax law change in Quebec. Partially offsetting these items were lower fiber
prices and improved performance in our businesses, including the synergies we continue to capture
from the GSPP Acquisition.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2006 we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
(revised 2004),   Share-Based Payment   which requires all share-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their
fair values. Our results of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 include $0.3 million of
compensation expense for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan. We expect the expense
for these items in fiscal 2006 to be approximately $1.0 million.

Our Net
Debt (is hereinafter defined) was $874.6 million and we are ahead of our expectations for debt
reduction after the GSPP Acquisition.

First Quarter Operations   

Results of Operations (Consolidated) 

Net Sales (Unaffiliated Customers)   

Net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 increased 27.1% to $490.4 million compared to $385.8
million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 primarily due to the GSPP Acquisition. Excluding the
$116.7 million of net sales from the acquired assets, our sales declined by 3.1%, primarily due to
lower display sales.

Cost of Goods Sold   

17

Table of Contents   

Cost of goods sold increased to $430.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 from $330.8 in
the prior year first quarter primarily due to the GSPP Acquisition and higher energy costs. The
increase in energy costs, adjusted for volume was $10.7 million. These costs were partially offset
by lower fiber costs of $3.4 million. Excluding amounts attributable to the GSPP Acquisition,
freight costs increased $2.2 million, workers  compensation expense and pension expense increased
$0.6 million each, and group insurance expense decreased $0.8 million during the first quarter of
fiscal 2006 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2005. We have foreign currency transaction
risk primarily due to our operations in Canada. The impact of foreign currency transaction risk in
the first quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2005 decreased costs of
goods sold by $0.4 million.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses   

Selling, general and administrative expenses  ( SG A  ) decreased as a percentage of net sales to
11.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 from 11.9% in first quarter of fiscal 2005 primarily as a
result of the synergies we realized following the GSPP Acquisition and our continued focus on cost
reductions and efficiency. SG A expenses were $11.4 million higher than in the prior year first
quarter primarily as a result of SG A from the GSPP locations we acquired, the third party costs we
incurred to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance including increased audit fees, which were
approximately $1.4 million, increased bonus expense of $1.1 million, and increased amortization
expense of $0.9 million from the GSPP Acquisition.

Restructuring and Other Costs   

We recorded aggregate pre-tax restructuring and other costs of $1.0 million and $0.5 million in the
first quarter of fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. We discuss these charges in more detail in
   Note 6. Acquisitions, Restructuring and Other Costs    of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements section of the Financial Statements included herein and incorporated herein by
reference.

Unconsolidated Joint Venture   

During the quarter ended December 31, 2005, our Seven Hills joint venture reported income of $1.6
million compared to income of $0.1 million for the same quarter last year. The increase in the
first quarter of fiscal 2006 represents a one-time adjustment of $1.2 million to record the impact
of the arbitrator s final ruling with respect to certain services that we rendered to Seven Hills.
These items were reserved by us at September 30, 2005; therefore the net impact to our condensed
consolidated statement of operations was income of $0.1 million.

Interest Expense   

Interest expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 increased $7.4 million to $13.9 million from
$6.4 million for the same quarter last year due primarily to our increased debt levels following
the GSPP Acquisition. The increase in our average outstanding borrowings increased interest
expense by approximately $6.7 million and higher interest rates, net of swaps, increased
interest expense by approximately $0.7 million.

Minority Interest   

Minority interest in income of our consolidated subsidiary for the first quarter of fiscal 2006
increased 50.1% to $1.3 million from $0.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The increase
was primarily due to the acquisition of our 60% ownership share in GSD as part of the GSPP
Acquisition.

Provision for Income Taxes   

We recorded an income tax benefit of $3.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to
income tax expense of $1.2 million for the same quarter last year. The benefit we recorded in the
current year quarter was primarily due to the loss we recorded in the period. The first quarter of
fiscal 2006 benefit was partially offset by deferred income tax expense of $1.4 million from a tax
law change in Quebec. The first quarter of fiscal 2005 tax

18

Table of Contents   

provision is higher than normal due to an adjustment of $0.6 million related to the acquisition of
the Athens corrugator. We originally recorded this adjustment as a reduction of tax
expense in the year ended September 30, 2004. We estimate that the annual marginal effective
income tax rate as of the quarter ended December 31, 2005, was approximately 38%.

Net Income (Loss)   

Net income (loss) in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and 2005 included pre-tax restructuring and
other costs of $1.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The first quarter of fiscal 2006 and
2005 included additional income tax expense of $1.4 million and $0.6 million, respectively.

Results of Operations (Segment Data) 

Packaging Products Segment (Aggregate Before Intersegment Eliminations)   

Net Sales (Packaging Products Segment) 

The 35.8% increase in net sales for the Packaging Products segment for the first quarter of fiscal
2006 compared to the prior year first quarter was primarily due to additional sales related to the
GSPP Acquisition. Excluding the GSPP sales, net sales for the packaging products segment were down
due primarily to the loss of a portion of the sales from folding carton facilities we have closed
in the past year.

Operating Income (Packaging Products Segment) 

Operating income of the Packaging Products segment for the quarter ended December 31, 2005
increased 29.3% compared to the prior year first quarter primarily due to the earnings from the
Gulf States plants we acquired in the GSPP Acquisition. The integration of the GSPP plants with
our folding operations has proceeded well and we are just beginning to benefit from operating
synergies. Return on sales was relatively unchanged despite increased freight costs of $1.1
million and increased material costs. Operating income was also reduced by pre-tax operating
losses of $1.1 million at our Waco and Marshville folding carton facilities
that were closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.

Merchandising Displays Segment (Aggregate Before Intersegment Eliminations)   

Net Sales (Merchandising Displays Segment) 

The 5.2% decrease in net sales for the Merchandising Displays segment for the first quarter of
fiscal 2006 compared to the prior year first quarter was primarily from lower display sales due to
decreased promotional orders from some of our largest customers.

Operating Income (Merchandising Displays Segment) 

Operating income attributable to the Merchandising Displays segment for the first quarter of fiscal
2006 increased 18.6% compared to the prior year first quarter despite lower sales due to margin
improvement and a favorable sales mix. The benefit from margin improvement and sales mix exceeded
the increased cost of higher energy, freight and bad debt.

Paperboard Segment (Aggregate Before Intersegment Eliminations)   

(a)  
       
     Recycled Paperboard Tons Shipped and Average Price Per Ton include tons shipped by Seven
Hills, our joint venture with Lafarge. 

(b)  
       
     Bleached paperboard and southern bleached softwood kraft (  SBSK  ) pulp tons shipped begin in
June 2005 as a result of the GSPP Acquisition. 

(c)  
       
     Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, Average Price Per Ton includes coated and
specialty recycled paperboard, corrugated medium, bleached paperboard and southern bleached
softwood kraft pulp. 

Net Sales (Paperboard Segment) 

Our Paperboard segment net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 increased 45.8% compared to
the first quarter of fiscal 2005 due to the GSPP Acquisition. In our paperboard business, average
recycled paperboard prices and recycled paperboard tons shipped were relatively unchanged compared
to the same period last year.

20

Table of Contents   

Operating Income (Paperboard Segment) 

Operating income attributable to the Paperboard segment for the first quarter of fiscal 2006
decreased $5.3 million to a loss of $1.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to
income of $4.4 million in the prior year first quarter despite the increased net sales discussed
above. We expected the first quarter of fiscal 2006 results to be materially lower than the first
quarter of last year primarily due to the spike in natural gas prices following Hurricane Katrina.
Higher energy costs in the segment reduced operating income by approximately $9.9 million,
including energy at our bleached paperboard mill. Our bleached paperboard mill we acquired in the
GSPP Acquisition had its annual maintenance shutdown during the quarter which kept the mill from
contributing in a significant manner. In our recycled paperboard mills, the cost of recycled
fiber, chemicals and freight aggregated to reduce costs by $2.7 million from the same period last
year. Our recycled paperboard mills operated at 91% of capacity, down from 92% in first quarter of
fiscal 2005.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Working Capital and Capital Expenditures   

We fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions from net cash
provided by operating activities; borrowings under term notes, our receivables-backed financing
facility and bank credit facilities, proceeds from the sale of discontinued assets, and
proceeds received in connection with the issuance of industrial development revenue bonds as well
as other debt and equity securities.

Cash and cash equivalents was $16.5 million at December 31, 2005, compared to $26.8 million at
September 30, 2005, an aggregate decrease of $10.3 million. Our debt balance at December 31, 2005
was $903.0 million compared to $915.1 million on September 30, 2005, a decrease of $12.1 million.
Our debt exposes us to changes in interest rates. We use swap instruments to manage the interest
rate characteristics of our outstanding debt. In June and September 2005, we entered into $350.0
million and $75.0 million of floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps, respectively, and designated
them as cash flow hedges of a like amount of our floating rate debt. We financed the GSPP
Acquisition primarily with debt. We have established a goal to reduce our Net Debt by $180.0
million by September 2007. For this goal, we assumed our debt would equal our March 31, 2005, Net
Debt of $396.3 million plus the purchase price of $552.2 million and that we would
reduce our Net Debt to $768.5 million by September 2007. Our actual Net Debt at December 31, 2005
was $874.6 million, implying that we reduced pro forma Net Debt by $73.9 million. We are ahead of
our expectations for debt reduction after the GSPP Acquisition.

We have a Senior Credit Facility that includes revolving credit and term loan facilities in the
aggregate principal amount of $700.0 million. The Senior Credit Facility is pre-payable at any
time and is scheduled to expire on June 6, 2010, and includes certain restrictive covenants. We
had $250.0 million outstanding under our term loan facility at both December 31, 2005 and September
30, 2005. At December 31, 2005, we had aggregate outstanding letters of credit under this facility
of approximately $44 million. At December 31, 2005, due to the covenants in the Senior Credit
Facility, maximum available borrowings under this facility were approximately $68 million. In
October 2005, we increased our 364-day receivables-backed financing facility from $75.0 million to
$100.0 million. It is scheduled to expire on October 25, 2006. Borrowing availability under this
facility is based on the eligible underlying receivables. At
December 31, 2005, we had drawn the maximum available under this
facility. At December 31, 2005 and September 30, 2005, we had $77.2 million and
$55.0 million, respectively, outstanding under our receivables-backed financing facility. At
December 31, 2005 and September 30, 2005, we had $182.3 million and $216.0 million, respectively,
outstanding under our revolving credit facility that is part of our Senior Credit Facility.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 was $17.3 million
and $22.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily due to the net
loss recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 as well as the creation of tax receivables.

Net cash used for investing activities was $13.2 million in the first quarter fiscal 2006 compared
to $13.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Net cash used for investing activities in
fiscal 2006 consisted primarily of the $13.5 million of capital expenditures. Net cash used for
investing activities in fiscal 2005 consisted primarily of $10.2 million of capital expenditures,
net purchases of marketable securities of $5.0 million, which were partially offset by proceeds
from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $2.0 million, primarily from previously idled
facilities and equipment.

Net cash used for financing activities was $14.0 million in first quarter of fiscal 2006 and $8.1
million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2006 and 2005, net cash used for financing
activities consisted primarily of net

21

Table of Contents   

repayments of debt, cash dividends paid to shareholders, and distributions to minority interest
partners, which were partially offset by issuances of common stock.

Our capital expenditures aggregated $13.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. We used
these expenditures primarily for the purchase and upgrading of machinery and equipment. We estimate
that our capital expenditures will aggregate approximately $65 million in fiscal 2006. We intend to
use these expenditures for the purchase and upgrading of machinery and equipment, including growth
and efficiency capital focused on our folding carton business, and maintenance capital.

As a result of the step-up in the tax basis of the Gulf States fixed assets and the future tax
depreciation from these assets, we do not anticipate paying any U.S. federal income taxes in fiscal
2006.

We anticipate that we will be able to fund our capital expenditures, interest payments, stock
repurchases, dividends, pension payments, working capital needs, and repayments of current portion
of long term debt for the foreseeable future from cash generated from operations, borrowings under
our Senior Credit Facility and Receivables Facility, proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity
securities or other additional long-term debt financing.

In October 2005 and January 2006, our board of directors approved a resolution to pay our quarterly
dividend of $0.09 per share, indicating an annualized dividend of $0.36 per year, on our common
stock.

Contractual Obligations  

For a discussion of contractual obligations, see the    Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Contractual
Obligations    section in our Fiscal 2005 Form 10-K. There have been no material developments with
respect to contractual obligations.

New Accounting Standards  

See    Note 3. New Accounting Standards    of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements included herein for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the
respective expected dates of adoption and expected effects on results of operations and financial
condition.

Non-GAAP Measures  

We have included in the discussion under the caption    Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations    above a financial measure that was not prepared in
accordance with GAAP. Any analysis of non-GAAP financial measures should be used only in
conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Below, we define the non-GAAP
financial measure, provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly
comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and discuss the reasons that we
believe this information is useful to management and may be useful to investors.

Net Debt  

We have defined the non-GAAP measure Net Debt to include the aggregate debt obligations reflected
in our balance sheet, less the hedge adjustments resulting from terminated and existing interest
rate derivatives or swaps, the balance of our cash and cash equivalents and certain other
investments that we consider to be readily available to satisfy such debt obligations.

Table of Contents   

Our management uses Net Debt, along with other factors, to evaluate our financial condition. We
believe that Net Debt is an appropriate supplemental measure of financial condition because it
provides a more complete understanding of our financial condition before the impact of our
decisions regarding the appropriate use of cash and liquid investments. Set forth below is a
reconciliation of Net Debt to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, Total Current Portion of
Debt and Total Long-Term Debt, Less Current Maturities (in thousands):

Forward-Looking Statements  

Statements made in this report constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
federal securities laws, including statements regarding, among other things, the impact of
operational restructuring activities, including the cost and timing of such activities, the size
and cost of employment terminations, operational consolidation, capacity utilization, cost
reductions and production efficiencies, estimated fair values of assets, and returns from planned
asset transactions, and the impact of such factors on earnings; the ability of insurance carriers
to pay potential claims under our insurance policies and our potential liability with respect
thereto; potential liability for outstanding guarantees and indemnities and the potential impact of
such liabilities; the impact of economic conditions, including the nature of the current market
environment, raw material and energy costs and market trends or factors that affect such trends,
such as expected price increases, competitive pricing pressures, cost increases, as well as the
impact and continuation of such factors; our results of operations, including our ability to
address operational inefficiencies, costs, sales growth or declines, the timing and impact of
customer transitioning, the impact of announced price increases and the impact of the gain and loss
of customers; pension plan contributions and expense, funding requirements and earnings;
environmental law liability as well as the impact of related compliance efforts, including the cost
of required improvements and the availability of certain indemnification claims; capital
expenditures for fiscal 2006; the cost and other effects of complying with governmental laws and
regulations and the timing of such costs, including those required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002; income tax rates; our ability to fund capital expenditures, interest payments, stock
repurchases, dividends, working capital needs and debt for the foreseeable future from available
cash and the proceeds from borrowings and security issuances; our estimates and assumptions
regarding our acquisition of the GSPP business and our ability to realize expected synergies from
the GSPP Acquisition; our estimates and assumptions regarding our contractual obligations and the
impact of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and cash flow; the impact of changes in
assumptions and estimates underlying accounting policies; the expected impact of implementing new
accounting standards; and the impact of changes in assumptions and estimates on which we based the
design of our system of disclosure controls and procedures. Such statements are based on our
current expectations and beliefs and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward looking
statement. With respect to these statements, we have made assumptions regarding, among other
things, economic, competitive and market conditions; volumes and price levels of purchases by
customers; competitive conditions in our businesses; possible adverse actions of our customers, our
competitors and suppliers; labor costs; the amount and timing of capital expenditures, including
installation costs, project development and implementation costs, severance and other shutdown
costs; restructuring costs; utilization of real property that is subject to the restructurings due
to realizable values from the sale of such property; credit availability; volumes and price levels
of purchases by customers; raw material and energy costs; and
competitive conditions in our businesses. Management believes its assumptions are reasonable;
however, undue reliance should not be placed on such estimates, which are based on current
expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks including, among
others, that our assumptions will prove to be inaccurate. There are many factors that impact these
forward-looking statements that we cannot predict accurately. Actual results may vary materially
from current expectations, in part because we manufacture most of our products against customer
orders

with short
lead times and small backlogs. Our earnings are dependent on volume due
to price levels and fixed operating costs. Further, our business is subject to a number of general
risks that would affect any such forward-looking statements including, among others, decreases in
demand for our products; increases in energy, raw material, shipping and capital equipment costs;
reduced supplies of raw materials; fluctuations in selling prices and volumes; intense competition;
our ability to identify, complete, integrate or finance acquisitions; the potential loss of certain
customers; adverse changes in and the cost of complying with extensive governmental regulations;
and adverse changes in general market and industry conditions. Such risks are more particularly
described in our filings with the SEC, including under the caption    Business   Forward-Looking
Information     and     Risk Factors    in our Fiscal 2005 Form 10-K. Further, forward-looking statements
speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not have or undertake any obligation to update
any such information as future events unfold.

Item 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

For a discussion of certain of the market risks to which we are exposed, see the    Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    section in our Fiscal 2005 Form 10-K.

Item 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e))
as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures are effective based on their evaluation of these controls and procedures
required by paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection
with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred
during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

We are a party to litigation incidental to our business from time to time. We are not currently a
party to any litigation that management believes, if determined adversely to us, would have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

and amends and restates in its entirety that certain Credit and Security

                             PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS

          Borrower desires to borrow from the Lenders from time to time.

          The Conduits may, in their absolute and sole discretion, make Advances
to Borrower from time to time. In the event that any Conduit declines to make
its Group's Percentage of any Advance, the applicable Conduit's Liquidity
Bank(s) shall, at the request of Borrower, make such Group's Percentage of such
Advance.

Wachovia Bank, National Association, has been requested and is willing
to act as Administrative Agent on behalf of the Co-Agents and the Conduit Groups
in accordance with the terms hereof.

                                   ARTICLE I.
                                  THE ADVANCES

     Section 1.1 Credit Facility.

          (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, from time to
time prior to the Facility Termination Date:

               (i) Borrower may request Advances in an aggregate principal
     amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed the lesser of the
     Aggregate Commitment and the Borrowing Base (such lesser amount, the
     "BORROWING LIMIT"); and

               (ii) upon receipt of a copy of each Borrowing Notice from
     Borrower, each of the Co-Agents shall determine whether its Conduit will
     fund a Loan in an amount equal to its Group's Percentage of the requested
     Advance specified in such Borrowing Notice. In the event that a Conduit
     elects not to make any such Loan to Borrower, the applicable Co-Agent shall
     promptly notify Borrower and, unless Borrower cancels its Borrowing Notice,
     each of such Conduit's Liquidity Banks severally agrees to make its Pro
     Rata Share of its Conduit Group's Percentage of such Loan to Borrower, on
     the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, PROVIDED THAT at no time
     may the aggregate principal amount of such Conduit's and such Conduit's
     Liquidity Banks' Loans outstanding exceed the lesser of (x) the aggregate
     amount of such Conduit's Liquidity Banks' Commitments, and (y) such
     Conduit's Group's Percentage of the Borrowing Base (such lesser amount, the
     "CONDUIT ALLOCATION LIMIT").

Each of the Advances, and all other Obligations of Borrower, shall be secured by
the Collateral as provided in Article XIII. It is the intent of the Conduits to
fund all Advances by the issuance of Commercial Paper.

          (b) Borrower may, upon at least 10 Business Days' notice to the
Co-Agents, terminate in whole or reduce in part, ratably among the Liquidity
Banks in each Group in accordance with such Conduit Group's Percentage, the
unused portion of the Aggregate Commitment; PROVIDED THAT each partial reduction
of the Aggregate Commitment shall be in an amount equal to $5,000,000 per
Conduit Group (or a larger integral multiple of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof)
and shall reduce the Commitments of the Liquidity Banks ratably in accordance
with their respective Pro Rata Shares.

     Section 1.2 Increases. Not later than 4:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the
second (2nd) Business Day prior to a proposed borrowing, Borrower shall provide
the Co-Agents with written notice of each Advance in the form set forth as
Exhibit II-A hereto (each, a "BORROWING NOTICE"). Each Borrowing Notice shall be
subject to Section 6.2 hereof and, except as set forth below, shall be
irrevocable and shall specify the requested increase in Aggregate Principal
(which shall not be less than $1,000,000 per Conduit Group or a larger integral
multiple of $100,000 per Conduit Group) and the Borrowing Date (which, in the
case of any Advance after

2

the initial Advance hereunder, shall only be on a Settlement Date) and, in the
case of an Advance to be funded by the Liquidity Banks, the requested Interest
Rate and Interest Period. If a Conduit declines to make its Percentage of a
proposed Advance, Borrower may cancel the Borrowing Notice or, in the absence of
such a cancellation, the Advance will be made by such Conduit's Liquidity Banks.
On the date of each Advance, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions
precedent set forth in Article VI, the applicable Conduit or the Conduit's
Liquidity Banks, as applicable, shall make the proceeds of its Loan comprising
such Conduit Group's Percentage of such requested Advance available to its
Co-Agent in immediately available funds on the proposed date of borrowing. Upon
receipt by a Co-Agent of such Loan proceeds, such Co-Agent shall deposit to the
Facility Account, in immediately available funds, no later than [2:00 P.M.] (New
York time), an amount equal to (i) in the case of a Conduit, such Conduit's
Group's Percentage of the principal amount of the requested Advance or (ii) in
the case of a Conduit's Liquidity Bank, each such Liquidity Bank's Pro Rata
Share of such Liquidity Bank's Group's Percentage of the principal amount of the
requested Advance.

     Section 1.3 Decreases. Except as provided in Section 1.4, Borrower shall
provide the Co-Agents with prior written notice of any proposed reduction of
Aggregate Principal in the form of Exhibit II-B hereto in conformity with the
Required Notice Period (each, a "REDUCTION NOTICE"). Such Reduction Notice shall
designate (i) the date (the "PROPOSED REDUCTION DATE") upon which any such
reduction of Aggregate Principal shall occur (which date shall give effect to
the applicable Required Notice Period), and (ii) the amount of Aggregate
Principal to be reduced which shall be applied ratably to the Loans of the
Conduits and the Liquidity Banks in accordance with the amount of principal (if
any) owing to the Conduits (ratably, based on their Group's Percentage of such
reduction), on the one hand, and the amount of principal (if any) owing to the
Liquidity Banks (ratably, based on their respective Pro Rata Shares of their
Group's Percentage of such reduction), on the other hand (the "AGGREGATE
REDUCTION"). Only one (1) Reduction Notice with respect to any Proposed
Reduction Date shall be outstanding at any time.

     Section 1.4 Deemed Collections; Borrowing Limit.

          (a) If on any day:

               (i) the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable is reduced as a
     result of any defective or rejected goods or services, any cash discount or
     any other adjustment by any Originator or any Affiliate thereof, or

               (ii) the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable is reduced or
     canceled as a result of a setoff in respect of any claim by the Obligor
     thereof (whether such claim arises out of the same or a related or an
     unrelated transaction), or

               (iii) the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable is reduced on
     account of the obligation of any Originator or any Affiliate thereof to pay
     to the related Obligor any rebate or refund, or

               (iv) the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable is less than the
     amount included in calculating the Net Pool Balance for purposes of any
     Monthly Report (for any reason

3

other than receipt of Collections thereon or such Receivable becoming a
     Defaulted Receivable), or

               (v) any of the representations or warranties of Borrower set
     forth in Section 5.1(i), (j), (r), (s), (t) or (u) were not true when made
     with respect to any Receivable,

then, on such day, Borrower shall be deemed to have received a Collection of
such Receivable (A) in the case of clauses (i)-(iv) above, in the amount of such
reduction or cancellation or the difference between the actual Outstanding
Balance and the amount included in calculating such Net Pool Balance, as
applicable; and (B) in the case of clause (v) above, in the amount of the
Outstanding Balance of such Receivable and, effective as of the date on which
the next succeeding Monthly Report is required to be delivered, the Borrowing
Base shall be reduced by the amount of such Deemed Collection.

          (b) Borrower shall ensure that the Aggregate Principal at no time
exceeds the Borrowing Limit. If at any time the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of the Loans from any Group exceeds such Group's Conduit Allocation
Limit, or the aggregate principal amount of the Loans outstanding from such
Group's Conduit exceeds the Liquidity Commitments of such Group's Liquidity
Banks pursuant to such Group's Liquidity Agreement divided by 102%, Borrower
shall prepay such Loans by wire transfer to the applicable Co-Agent received not
later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the next succeeding Settlement
Date of an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess, together with accrued and
unpaid interest on the amount prepaid (as allocated by the applicable Co-Agent),
such that after giving effect to such payment the Aggregate Principal is less
than or equal to the Borrowing Limit and the applicable Conduit Group's
Percentage of the Aggregate Principal is less than or equal to the applicable
Group's Conduit Allocation Limit.

     Section 1.5 Payment Requirements. All amounts to be paid or deposited by
any Loan Party pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be paid or
deposited in accordance with the terms hereof no later than 12:00 noon (New York
City time) on the day when due in immediately available funds, and if not
received before 12:00 noon (New York City time) shall be deemed to be received
on the next succeeding Business Day. If such amounts are payable to a Lender
they shall be paid to the applicable Co-Agent Account, for the account of such
Lender, until otherwise notified by such Co-Agent. Upon notice to Borrower, a
Co-Agent may debit the Facility Account for all amounts due and payable to it
hereunder. All computations of CP Costs, Interest, per annum fees calculated as
part of any CP Costs, per annum fees hereunder and per annum fees under the Fee
Letter shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of
days elapsed. If any amount hereunder shall be payable on a day which is not a
Business Day, such amount shall be payable on the next succeeding Business Day.

     Section 1.6 Advances; Ratable Loans; Funding Mechanics; Liquidity Fundings.

          (a) Each Advance hereunder shall be made on a pro rata basis in
accordance with each Conduit Group's Percentage; PROVIDED THAT the first Advance
on or after the date hereof will be made in such amounts that, after giving
effect thereto, the principal balance then outstanding shall be ratable with
such Percentages.

4

(b) Each Advance hereunder shall consist of one or more Loans made by
the Conduits and/or the applicable Liquidity Banks.

          (c) Each Lender funding any Loan shall wire transfer the principal
amount of its Loan to its Co-Agent in immediately available funds as soon as
possible and in no event later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the
applicable Borrowing Date and, subject to such Co-Agent's receipt of such Loan
proceeds, such Co-Agent shall wire transfer such funds to the account specified
by Borrower in its Borrowing Notice promptly after receipt.

          (d) While it is the intent of each Conduit to fund and maintain each
requested Advance through the issuance of its respective Commercial Paper, the
parties acknowledge that if any Conduit is unable, or determines that it is
undesirable, to issue Commercial Paper to fund all or any portion of its Loans,
or is unable to repay such Commercial Paper upon the maturity thereof, such
Conduit shall put all or any portion of its Loans to its Liquidity Banks at any
time pursuant to its applicable Liquidity Agreement to finance or refinance the
necessary portion of its Loans through a Liquidity Funding to the extent
available. The Liquidity Fundings may be Alternate Base Rate Loans or LIBO Rate
Loans, or a combination thereof, selected by Borrower in accordance with Article
IV. Regardless of whether a Liquidity Funding constitutes the direct funding of
a Loan, an assignment of a Loan made by a Conduit or the sale of one or more
participations in a Loan made by a Conduit, each Liquidity Bank in such
Conduit's Group participating in a Liquidity Funding shall have the rights of a
"Lender" hereunder with the same force and effect as if it had directly made a
Loan to Borrower in the amount of its Liquidity Funding.

          (e) Nothing herein shall be deemed to commit any Conduit to make
Loans.

                                   ARTICLE II.
                            PAYMENTS AND COLLECTIONS

as and when Collections are received;

          (b) the fees set forth in the Fee Letter on the dates specified
therein;

          (c) all accrued and unpaid Interest on the Alternate Base Rate Loans

Section 2.2 Collections Prior to Amortization. On each Settlement Date
prior to the Amortization Date, the Servicer shall deposit to the applicable
Co-Agent Account, for distribution to the applicable Lenders, a portion of the
Collections received by it during the preceding Settlement Period (after
deduction of its Servicing Fee) equal to the sum of the following amounts for
application to the Obligations in the order specified:

          FIRST, ratably to the payment of all accrued and unpaid CP Costs,
Interest and Broken Funding Costs (if any) that are then due and owing,

          SECOND, ratably to the payment of all accrued and unpaid fees under
the Fee Letter (if any) that are then due and owing to the applicable Conduit or
its Co-Agent,

          THIRD, if required under Section 1.3 or 1.4, to the ratable reduction
of the applicable Conduit's Percentage of the Aggregate Principal, and

          FOURTH, for the ratable payment of all other unpaid Obligations of
Borrower, if any, that are then due and owing.

The balance, if any, shall be paid to Borrower or otherwise in accordance with
Borrower's instructions. Collections applied to the payment of Obligations of
Borrower shall be distributed in accordance with the aforementioned provisions,
and, giving effect to each of the priorities set forth above in this Section
2.2, shall be shared ratably (within each priority) among the applicable
Co-Agent and the Lenders in its Conduit Group in accordance with the amount of
such Obligations owing to each of them in respect of each such priority.

     Section 2.3 Collections Following Amortization. On the Amortization Date
and on each day thereafter, the Servicer shall set aside and hold in trust, for
the Secured Parties, all Collections received on such day. On and after the
Amortization Date, the Servicer shall, on each Settlement Date and on each other
Business Day specified by the Administrative Agent at the direction of any
Co-Agent (after deduction of any accrued and unpaid Servicing Fee as of such
date): (i) remit to the applicable Co-Agent Account the applicable Conduit
Group's Percentage of the amounts set aside and held in trust pursuant to the
preceding sentence, and (ii) apply such amounts to reduce the Obligations of
Borrower as follows:

          FIRST, to the reimbursement of the applicable Conduit Group's
Percentage Share of the Administrative Agent's costs of collection and
enforcement of this Agreement,

          SECOND, ratably to the payment of all accrued and unpaid CP Costs,
Interest and Broken Funding Costs (if any),

          THIRD, ratably to the payment of all accrued and unpaid fees under the
Fee Letter,

          FOURTH, to the ratable reduction of such Conduit's Percentage of the
Aggregate Principal,

          FIFTH, for the ratable payment of all other unpaid Obligations of
Borrower, and

6

SIXTH, after the Obligations of Borrower have been indefeasibly
reduced to zero, to Borrower.

Collections applied to the payment of Obligations of Borrower shall be
distributed in accordance with the aforementioned provisions, and, giving effect
to each of the priorities set forth above in this Section 2.3, shall be shared
ratably (within each priority) among the Co-Agents and the Lenders in accordance
with the amount of such Obligations owing to each of them in respect of each
such priority.

     Section 2.4 Payment Rescission. No payment of any of the Obligations shall
be considered paid or applied hereunder to the extent that, at any time, all or
any portion of such payment or application is rescinded by application of law or
judicial authority, or must otherwise be returned or refunded for any reason.
Borrower shall remain obligated for the amount of any payment or application so
rescinded, returned or refunded, and shall promptly pay to the applicable
Co-Agent Account (for application to the Person or Persons who suffered such
rescission, return or refund) the full amount thereof, plus Interest on such
amount at the Default Rate from the date of any such rescission, return or
refunding.

                                  ARTICLE III.
                                 CONDUIT FUNDING

     Section 3.1 CP Costs. Borrower shall pay CP Costs with respect to the
principal balance of the Loans from time to time outstanding. Each Loan of a
Conduit that is funded substantially with Pooled Commercial Paper will accrue CP
Costs each day on a pro rata basis, based upon the percentage share that the
principal in respect of such Loan represents in relation to all assets held by
such Conduit and funded substantially with related Pooled Commercial Paper on
such day.

     Section 3.2 Calculation of CP Costs. Not later than the 3rd Business Day
immediately preceding each Monthly Reporting Date, each Conduit shall calculate
the aggregate amount of CP Costs applicable to its CP Rate Loans for the
Calculation Period then most recently ended and shall notify Borrower of such
aggregate amount.

     Section 3.3 CP Costs Payments. On each Settlement Date, Borrower shall pay
to each of the Co-Agents (for the benefit of its respective Conduit) an
aggregate amount equal to all accrued and unpaid CP Costs in respect of the
principal associated with all CP Rate Loans of such Conduit for the calendar
month then most recently ended in accordance with Article II.

     Section 3.4 Default Rate. From and after the occurrence of an Amortization
Event, all Loans of the Conduits shall accrue Interest at the Default Rate and
shall cease to be CP Rate Loans.

                                   ARTICLE IV.
                             LIQUIDITY BANK FUNDING

     Section 4.1 Liquidity Bank Funding. Prior to the occurrence of an
Amortization Event, the outstanding principal balance of each Liquidity Funding
shall accrue interest for each day during its Interest Period at either the LIBO
Rate or the Alternate Base Rate in accordance

7

with the terms and conditions hereof. Until Borrower gives notice to the
applicable Co-Agent of another Interest Rate in accordance with Section 4.4, the
initial Interest Rate for any Loan transferred to the Liquidity Banks by the
applicable Conduit pursuant to the applicable Liquidity Agreement shall be the
Alternate Base Rate (unless the Default Rate is then applicable). If the
applicable Liquidity Banks acquire by assignment from the applicable Conduit any
Loan pursuant to the applicable Liquidity Agreement, each Loan so assigned shall
each be deemed to have an Interest Period commencing on the date of any such
assignment.

     Section 4.2 Interest Payments. On the Settlement Date for each Liquidity
Funding, Borrower shall pay to the applicable Co-Agent (for the benefit of the
Liquidity Banks in its Conduit Group) an aggregate amount equal to the accrued
and unpaid Interest for the entire Interest Period of each such Liquidity
Funding in accordance with Article II.

     Section 4.3 Selection and Continuation of Interest Periods.

          (a) With consultation from the applicable Co-Agent, Borrower shall
from time to time request Interest Periods for the Liquidity Fundings, PROVIDED
THAT if at any time any Liquidity Funding is outstanding, Borrower shall always
request Interest Periods such that at least one Interest Period shall end on the
date specified in clause (A) of the definition of Settlement Date.

          (b) Borrower or the applicable Co-Agent, upon notice to and consent by
the other received at least three (3) Business Days prior to the end of an
Interest Period (the "TERMINATING TRANCHE") for any Liquidity Funding, may,
effective on the last day of the Terminating Tranche: (i) divide any such
Liquidity Funding into multiple Liquidity Fundings, (ii) combine any such
Liquidity Funding with one or more other Liquidity Fundings that have a
Terminating Tranche ending on the same day as such Terminating Tranche or (iii)
combine any such Liquidity Funding with a new Liquidity Funding to be made by
the Liquidity Banks on the day such Terminating Tranche ends.

     Section 4.4 Liquidity Bank Interest Rates. Borrower may select the LIBO
Rate or the Alternate Base Rate for each Liquidity Funding. Borrower shall by
12:00 noon (New York time): (i) at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
expiration of any Terminating Tranche with respect to which the LIBO Rate is
being requested as a new Interest Rate and (ii) at least one (1) Business Day
prior to the expiration of any Terminating Tranche with respect to which the
Alternate Base Rate is being requested as a new Interest Rate, give the
applicable Co-Agent irrevocable notice of the new Interest Rate for the
Liquidity Funding associated with such Terminating Tranche. Until Borrower gives
notice to the Applicable Co-Agent of another Interest Rate, the initial Interest
Rate for any Loan transferred to the applicable Liquidity Banks pursuant to the
applicable Liquidity Agreement shall be the Alternate Base Rate (unless the
Default Rate is then applicable).

     Section 4.5 Suspension of the LIBO Rate

          (a) If any Liquidity Bank notifies its applicable Co-Agent that it has
determined that funding its Pro Rata Share of its Conduit Group's Percentage of
the Liquidity Fundings at a LIBO Rate would violate any applicable law, rule,
regulation, or directive of any governmental

8

or regulatory authority, whether or not having the force of law, or that (i)
deposits of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund its Liquidity Funding
at such LIBO Rate are not available or (ii) such LIBO Rate does not accurately
reflect the cost of acquiring or maintaining a Liquidity Funding at such LIBO
Rate, then such Co-Agent shall suspend the availability of such LIBO Rate and
require Borrower to select the Alternate Base Rate for any Liquidity Funding of
such Liquidity Bank accruing Interest at such LIBO Rate.

          (b) If less than all of the Liquidity Banks of any applicable Conduit
Group give a notice to such Group's Co-Agent pursuant to Section 4.5(a), each
Liquidity Bank which gave such a notice shall be obliged, at the request of
Borrower, the applicable Conduit or the applicable Co-Agent, to assign all of
its rights and obligations hereunder to (i) another Liquidity Bank in its
Conduit Group or (ii) another funding entity nominated by Borrower or the
applicable Co-Agent that is an Eligible Assignee willing to participate in this
Agreement through the Liquidity Termination Date in the place of such notifying
Liquidity Bank; PROVIDED THAT (i) the notifying Liquidity Bank receives payment
in full, pursuant to an Assignment Agreement, of all Obligations owing to it
(whether due or accrued), and (ii) the replacement Liquidity Bank otherwise
satisfies the requirements of Section 12.1(b).

     Section 4.6 Default Rate. From and after the occurrence of an Amortization
Event, all Liquidity Fundings shall accrue Interest at the Default Rate.

                                   ARTICLE V.
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     Section 5.1 Representations and Warranties of the Loan Parties. Each Loan
Party hereby represents and warrants to the Agents and the Lenders, as to
itself, as of the date hereof, as of the date of each Advance and as of each
Settlement Date that:

duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign entity, and
has and holds all organizational power and all governmental licenses,
authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on its business in each

The execution and delivery by such Loan Party of this Agreement and each other
Transaction Document to which it is a party, and the performance of its
obligations hereunder and thereunder and, in the case of Borrower, Borrower's
use of the proceeds of Advances made hereunder, are within its corporate powers
and authority and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
its part. This Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which such Loan
Party is a party has been duly executed and delivered by such Loan Party.

9

(c) No Conflict. The execution and delivery by such Loan Party of this
Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it is a party, and the
performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder do not contravene or
violate (i) its certificate or articles of incorporation or by-laws, (ii) any
law, rule or regulation applicable to it, (iii) any restrictions under any
agreement, contract or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any
of its property is bound, or (iv) any order, writ, judgment, award, injunction
or decree binding on or affecting it or its property, and do not result in the
creation or imposition of any Adverse Claim on assets of such Loan Party or its
Subsidiaries (except as created hereunder) except, in any case, where such
contravention or violation would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect; and no transaction contemplated hereby requires compliance with
any bulk sales act or similar law.

          (d) Governmental Authorization. Other than the filing of the financing
statements required hereunder, no authorization or approval or other action by,
and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body
is required for the due execution and delivery by such Loan Party of this
Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it is a party and the
performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder.

          (e) Actions, Suits. There are no actions, suits or proceedings
pending, or to the best of such Loan Party's knowledge, threatened, against or
affecting such Loan Party, or any of its properties, in or before any court,
arbitrator or other body, that would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Such Loan Party is not in default with respect to any order of
any court, arbitrator or governmental body.

          (f) Binding Effect. This Agreement and each other Transaction Document
to which such Loan Party is a party constitute the legal, valid and binding
obligations of such Loan Party enforceable against such Loan Party in accordance
with their respective terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws relating
to or limiting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

          (g) Accuracy of Information. All information heretofore furnished by
such Loan Party or any of its Affiliates to the Agents or the Lenders for
purposes of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the other Transaction
Documents or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby is, and all such
information hereafter furnished by such Loan Party or any of its Affiliates to
the Agents or the Lenders will be, true and accurate in every material respect
on the date such information is stated or certified and does not and will not
contain any material misstatement of fact or omit to state a material fact or
any fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not materially
misleading.

10

(h) Use of Proceeds. Borrower represents and warrants that no proceeds
of any Advance hereunder will be used (i) for a purpose that violates, or would
be inconsistent with, (A) Section 7.2(e) of this Agreement or (B) Regulation T,
U or X promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from
time to time or (ii) to acquire any security in any transaction which is subject

respect thereto, free and clear of any Adverse Claim, except as created by the

Business Days after the date of any Advance) will be duly filed all financing
statements or other similar instruments or documents necessary under the UCC (or
any comparable law) of all appropriate jurisdictions to perfect the
Administrative Agent's (on behalf of the Secured Parties) security interest in
the Collateral. Each of the Loan Parties represents and warrants that such Loan
Party's jurisdiction of organization is a jurisdiction whose law generally
requires information concerning the existence of a nonpossessory security
interest to be made generally available in a filing, record or registration
system as a condition or result of such a security interest's obtaining priority
over the rights of a lien creditor which respect to collateral.

          (k) Places of Business and Locations of Records. The principal places
of business and chief executive office of such Loan Party and the offices where
it keeps all of its Records are located at the address(es) listed on Exhibit III
or such other locations of which the Administrative Agent has been notified in

Servicer access to the Lock-Boxes and Collection Accounts prior to delivery of a
Collection Notice, Borrower has not granted any Person, other than the
Administrative Agent or the TPF Agent as contemplated by this Agreement,
dominion and control of any Lock-Box or Collection Account, or the right to take
dominion and control of any such Lock-Box or Collection Account at a future time
or upon the occurrence of a future event.

          (m) Material Adverse Effect. (i) The initial Servicer represents and
warrants that since June 30, 2005, no event has occurred that would have a
material adverse effect on the

11

financial condition or operations of the initial Servicer or the ability of the
initial Servicer to perform its obligations under this Agreement, and (ii)
Borrower represents and warrants that since the date of this Agreement, no event
has occurred that would have a material adverse effect on (A) the financial
condition or operations of Borrower, (B) the ability of Borrower to perform its
obligations under the Transaction Documents, or (C) the collectibility of the
Receivables generally or any material portion of the Receivables.

          (n) Names. Borrower represents and warrants that: (i) the name in
which Borrower has executed this Agreement is identical to the name of Borrower
as indicated on the public record of its state of organization which shows
Borrower to have been organized, and (ii) in the past five (5) years, Borrower
has not used any corporate names, trade names or assumed names other than the
name in which it has executed this Agreement.

          (o) Ownership of Borrower. Rock-Tenn Company owns, directly or
indirectly, 100% of the issued and outstanding Equity Interest of Borrower, free

paid and nonassessable, and there are no options, warrants or other rights to
acquire securities of Borrower.

          (p) Not a Holding Company or an Investment Company. Such Loan Party is
not a "holding company" or a "subsidiary holding company" of a "holding company"
within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as
amended, or any successor statute. Such Loan Party is not an "investment
company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,
or any successor statute.

          (q) Compliance with Law. Such Loan Party has complied in all respects
with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, orders, writs, judgments,
injunctions, decrees or awards to which it may be subject, except where the
failure to so comply would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Borrower represents and warrants that each Receivable, together with the
Contract related thereto, does not contravene any laws, rules or regulations
applicable thereto (including, without limitation, laws, rules and regulations
relating to truth in lending, fair credit billing, fair credit reporting, equal
credit opportunity, fair debt collection practices and privacy), and no part of
such Contract is in violation of any such law, rule or regulation, except where
such contravention or violation would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

          (r) Compliance with Credit and Collection Policy. Such Loan Party has
complied in all material respects with the Credit and Collection Policy with
regard to each Receivable and the related Contract, and has not made any change
to such Credit and Collection Policy, except such material change as to which
the Administrative Agent has been notified in accordance with Section
7.1(a)(vii).

          (s) Payments to Applicable Originator. Borrower represents and
warrants that: (i) with respect to each Receivable transferred to Borrower under
the Receivables Sale Agreement, Borrower has given reasonably equivalent value
to the applicable Originator in consideration therefor and such transfer was not
made for or on account of an antecedent debt, and (ii) no transfer by any
Originator of any Receivable under the Receivables Sale Agreement is

12

or may be voidable under any section of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 (11
U.S.C. Sections 101 et seq.), as amended.

          (t) Enforceability of Contracts. Borrower represents and warrants that
each Contract with respect to each Receivable is effective to create, and has
created, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the related Obligor to pay the
Outstanding Balance of the Receivable created thereunder and any accrued
interest thereon, enforceable against the Obligor in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other similar laws relating to or limiting creditors' rights
generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement
is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

          (u) Eligible Receivables. Each Receivable included in the Net Pool
Balance as an Eligible Receivable on the date of any Monthly Report was an
Eligible Receivable on such date.

          (v) Borrowing Limit. Immediately after giving effect to each Advance
and each settlement on any Settlement Date hereunder, the Aggregate Principal is
less than or equal to the Borrowing Limit.

          (w) Accounting. The manner in which such Loan Party accounts for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Receivables Sale Agreement
does not jeopardize the true sale analysis.

     Section 5.2 Liquidity Bank Representations and Warranties. Each Liquidity
Bank hereby represents and warrants to the Agents, Conduits and the Loan Parties
that:

          (a) Existence and Power. Such Liquidity Bank is a banking association
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization, and has all organizational power to perform its

agreement, contract or instrument to which it is a party or any of its property
is bound, or (iv) any order, writ, judgment, award, injunction or decree binding
on or affecting it or its property, and do not result in the creation or
imposition of any Adverse Claim on its assets. This Agreement and the Liquidity
Agreement have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such Liquidity
Bank.

          (c) Governmental Authorization. No authorization or approval or other
action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or
regulatory body is required for the due execution and delivery by such Liquidity
Bank of this Agreement or the Liquidity Agreement and the performance of its
obligations hereunder or thereunder.

13

(d) Binding Effect. Each of this Agreement and the Liquidity Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Liquidity Bank
enforceable against such Liquidity Bank in accordance with its terms, except as
such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other similar laws relating to or limiting creditors' rights
generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

     the Administrative Agent all Contracts (including, without limitation, all
     multiple originals of any such Contract constituting an instrument, a
     certificated security or chattel paper) relating to the Receivables.

17

(f) Compliance with Contracts and Credit and Collection Policy. Such
Loan Party will (and will cause each Originator to) timely and fully (i) perform
and comply with all provisions, covenants and other promises required to be

in all respects with the Credit and Collection Policy in regard to each
Receivable and the related Contract.

          (g) Maintenance and Enforcement of Receivables Sale Agreement and
Performance Undertaking. Borrower will maintain the effectiveness of, and
continue to perform under the Receivables Sale Agreement and the Performance
Undertaking, such that it does not amend, restate, supplement, cancel, terminate
or otherwise modify the Receivables Sale Agreement or the Performance
Undertaking, or give any consent, waiver, directive or approval thereunder or
waive any default, action, omission or breach under the Receivables Sale
Agreement or the Performance Undertaking or otherwise grant any indulgence
thereunder, without (in each case) the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent. Borrower will, and will require each Originator to,
perform each of their respective obligations and undertakings under and pursuant
to the Receivables Sale Agreement, will purchase Receivables thereunder in
strict compliance with the terms thereof and will vigorously enforce the rights
and remedies accorded to Borrower under the Receivables Sale Agreement. Borrower
will take all actions to perfect and enforce its rights and interests (and the
rights and interests of the Agents and the Lenders as assignees of Borrower)
under the Receivables Sale Agreement as any of the Agents may from time to time
reasonably request, including, without limitation, making claims to which it may
be entitled under any indemnity, reimbursement or similar provision contained in
the Receivables Sale Agreement.

          (h) Ownership. Borrower will (or will cause each Originator to) take
all necessary action to (i) vest legal and equitable title to the Collateral
purchased under the Receivables Sale Agreement irrevocably in Borrower, free and
clear of any Adverse Claims (other than Adverse Claims in favor of the
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties) including, without
limitation, the filing of all financing statements or other similar instruments
or documents necessary under the UCC (or any comparable law) of all appropriate
jurisdictions to perfect Borrower's interest in such Collateral and such other
action to perfect, protect or more fully evidence the interest of Borrower
therein as any of the Agents may reasonably request), and (ii) establish and
maintain, in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured
Parties, a valid and perfected first priority security interest in all
Collateral, free and clear of any Adverse Claims, including, without limitation,
the filing of all financing statements or other similar instruments or documents
necessary under the UCC (or any comparable law) of all appropriate jurisdictions
to perfect the Administrative Agent's (for the benefit of the Secured Parties)
security interest in the Collateral and such other action to perfect, protect or
more fully evidence the interest of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of
the Secured Parties as any of the Agents may reasonably request.

          (i) Lenders' Reliance. Borrower acknowledges that the Agents and the
Lenders are entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
reliance upon Borrower's identity as a legal entity that is separate from each
Originator. Therefore, from and after the date of execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Borrower shall take all reasonable steps, including, without
limitation, all steps that any Agent or any Lender may from time to time
reasonably request, to maintain Borrower's identity as a separate legal entity
and to make it

18

manifest to third parties that Borrower is an entity with assets and liabilities
distinct from those of each Originator and any Affiliates thereof (other than
Borrower) and not just a division of any Originator or any such Affiliate.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and in addition to the other
covenants set forth herein, Borrower will:

               (i) maintain books, financial records and bank accounts in a

     business functions with the assets, funds, liabilities or business
     functions of any other person or entity except for payments that may be
     received in any Lock-Box prior to 30 days after the date of this Agreement;

               (iii) observe all appropriate corporation procedures and
     formalities;

     consolidated, the pro-rata cost) of the preparation of its financial
     statements, and have such financial statements audited by a certified
     public accounting firm that is not affiliated with Borrower or its
     Affiliates;

               (vii) not guarantee or become obligated for the debts or
     obligations of any other entity or person;

               (viii) not hold out its credit as being available to satisfy the
     debts or obligations of any other person or entity;

               (ix) hold itself out as an entity separate and distinct from any

     and nonarbitrarily any rent and overhead expenses among and between such
     entities with the result that each entity bears its fair share of all such
     rent and expenses;

               (xiv) to the extent that Borrower and any of its Affiliates share
     the same officers, allocate fairly, appropriately and nonarbitrarily any
     salaries and expenses related to providing benefits to such officers
     between or among such entities, with the result that each such entity will
     bear its fair share of the salary and benefit costs associated with all
     such common or shared officers;

               (xv) to the extent that Borrower and any of its Affiliates
     jointly contract or do business with vendors or service providers or share
     overhead expenses, allocate fairly, appropriately and nonarbitrarily any
     costs and expenses incurred in so doing between or among such entities,
     with the result that each such entity bears its fair share of all such
     costs and expenses;

               (xvi) to the extent Borrower contracts or does business with
     vendors or service providers where the goods or services are wholly or
     partially for the benefit of its Affiliates, allocate fairly, appropriately
     and nonarbitrarily any costs incurred in so doing to the entity for whose
     benefit such goods or services are provided, with the result that each such
     entity bears its fair share of all such costs;

               (xvii) not make any loans to any person or entity (other than
     such intercompany loans between Borrower and each Originator contemplated
     by this Agreement) or buy or hold any indebtedness issued by any other
     person or entity (except for cash and investment-grade securities);

               (xviii) conduct its own business in its own name;

               (xix) hold all of its assets in its own name;

               (xx) maintain an arm's-length relationship with its Affiliates

               (xxi) not pledge its assets for the benefit of any other Person;

               (xxii) not identify itself as a division or department of any

               (xxiii) maintain adequate capital in light of its contemplated
     business operations and in no event less than the Required Capital Amount
     (as defined in the Receivables Sale Agreement) and refrain from making any
     dividend, distribution, redemption of capital stock or payment of any
     subordinated indebtedness which would cause the Required Capital Amount to
     cease to be so maintained;

               (xxiv) conduct transactions between Borrower and third parties in
     the name of Borrower and as an entity separate and independent from each of
     its Affiliates;

20

(xxv) cause representatives and agents of Borrower to hold
     themselves out to third parties as being representatives or agents, as the
     case may be, of Borrower;

               (xxvi) cause transactions and agreements between Borrower, on the
     one hand, and any one or more of its Affiliates, on the other hand
     (including transactions and agreements pursuant to which the assets or
     property of one is used or to be used by the other), to be entered into in
     the names of the entities that are parties to the transaction or agreement,
     to be formally documented in writing and to be approved in advance by the
     Board (including the affirmative vote of the Independent Director);

               (xxvii) cause the pricing and other material terms of all such
     transactions and agreements to be established at the inception of the
     particular transaction or agreement on commercially reasonable terms
     (substantially similar to the terms that would have been established in a
     transaction between unrelated third parties) by written agreement (by
     formula or otherwise);

               (xxviii) not acquire or assume the obligations or acquire the
     securities of its Affiliates or owners, including partners of its
     Affiliates, provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower
     is authorized to engage in and consummate each of the transactions
     contemplated by each Transaction Document and Borrower is authorized to
     perform its obligations under each Transaction Document;

               (xxix) maintain its corporate charter in conformity with this
     Agreement, such that it does not amend, restate, supplement or otherwise

     the Transaction Documents, including, without limitation, Section 7.1(i) of
     this Agreement;

               (xxx) maintain its corporate separateness such that it does not

     except as otherwise contemplated herein) all or substantially all of its
     assets (whether now owned or hereafter acquired) to, or acquire all or
     substantially all of the assets of, any Person, nor at any time create,
     have, acquire, maintain or hold any interest in any Subsidiary; and

               (xxxi) take such other actions as are necessary on its part to
     ensure that the facts and assumptions set forth in the opinion issued by
     King & Spalding, as counsel for Borrower, in connection with the closing or
     initial Advance under this Agreement and relating to substantive
     consolidation issues, and in the certificates accompanying such opinion,
     remain true and correct in all material respects at all times.

          (j) Collections. Such Loan Party will cause (1) all proceeds from all
Lock-Boxes to be directly deposited by a Collection Bank into a Collection
Account and (2) each Lock-Box and Collection Account to be subject at all times
to a Collection Account Agreement that is in full force and effect; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the Collection Account at Wachovia need not be subject to a
Collection Account Agreement until December 9, 2005. In the event any payments
relating to the Collateral are remitted directly to Borrower or any Affiliate of

21

Borrower, Borrower will remit (or will cause all such payments to be remitted)

(2) Business Days following receipt thereof, and, at all times prior to such

by this Agreement and except for access granted to Servicer prior to delivery of
Collection Notices.

          (k) Taxes. Such Loan Party will file all tax returns and reports
required by law to be filed by it and will promptly pay all taxes and
governmental charges at any time owing, except any such taxes which are not yet
delinquent or are being diligently contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and for which adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP shall have
been set aside on its books. Borrower will pay when due any and all present and
future stamp, documentary, and other similar taxes and governmental charges
payable in connection with the Receivables, and hold each of the Indemnified
Parties harmless from and against any and all liabilities with respect to or
resulting from any delay or omission to pay such taxes and governmental charges.

          (l) Payment to Applicable Originator. With respect to any Receivable
purchased by Borrower from any Originator, such sale shall be effected under,
and in strict compliance with the terms of, the Receivables Sale Agreement,
including, without limitation, the terms relating to the amount and timing of
payments to be made to such Originator in respect of the purchase price for such
Receivable.

     Section 7.2 Negative Covenants of the Loan Parties. Until the Final Payout
Date, each Loan Party hereby covenants, as to itself, that:

          (a) Name Change, Offices and Records. Such Loan Party will not change
its name, identity or structure (within the meaning of any applicable enactment
of the UCC), relocate its chief executive office at any time while the location

will not add or terminate any bank as a Collection Bank, or make any change in
the instructions to Obligors regarding payments to be made to any Lock-Box or
Collection Account, unless the Administrative Agent shall have received, at
least ten (10) days before the proposed effective date therefor, (i) written
notice of such addition, termination or change and (ii) with respect to the
addition of a Collection Bank or a Collection Account or Lock-Box, an executed
Collection

22

Account Agreement with respect to the new Collection Account or Lock-Box;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Servicer may make changes in instructions to
Obligors regarding payments if such new instructions require such Obligor to
make payments to another existing Collection Account.

          (c) Modifications to Contracts and Credit and Collection Policy. Such
Loan Party will not, and will not permit any Originator to, make any change to
the Credit and Collection Policy that could adversely affect the collectibility
of the Receivables or decrease the credit quality of any newly created
Receivables. Except as provided in Section 8.2(d), the Servicer will not, and
will not permit any Originator to, extend, amend or otherwise modify the terms
of any Receivable or any Contract related thereto other than in accordance with
the Credit and Collection Policy.

          (d) Sales, Liens. Borrower will not sell, assign (by operation of law
or otherwise) or otherwise dispose of, or grant any option with respect to, or
create or suffer to exist any Adverse Claim upon (including, without limitation,
the filing of any financing statement) or with respect to, any of the
Collateral, or assign any right to receive income with respect thereto (other
than, in each case, the creation of a security interest therein in favor of the
Administrative Agent as provided for herein), and Borrower will defend the
right, title and interest of the Secured Parties in, to and under any of the
foregoing property, against all claims of third parties claiming through or
under Borrower or any Originator.

          (e) Use of Proceeds. Borrower will not use the proceeds of the

Security under and in accordance with the Receivables Sale Agreement, including
without limitation, making payments on the Subordinated Notes to the extent
permitted thereunder and under the Receivables Sale Agreement, (ii) making
demand loans to the Parent or the Originators at any time prior to the Facility
Termination Date while no Amortization Event or Unmatured Amortization Event
exists and is continuing, (iii) paying its ordinary and necessary operating
expenses when and as due, and (iv) making Restricted Junior Payments to the
extent permitted under this Agreement.

          (f) Termination Date Determination. Borrower will not designate the
Termination Date, or send any written notice to any Originator in respect
thereof, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, except
with respect to the occurrence of a Termination Date arising pursuant to Section
5.1(d) of the Receivables Sale Agreement.

          (g) Restricted Junior Payments. Borrower will not make any Restricted
Junior Payment if after giving effect thereto, Borrower's Net Worth (as defined
in the Receivables Sale Agreement) would be less than the Required Capital
Amount (as defined in the Receivables Sale Agreement).

          (h) Borrower Debt. Borrower will not incur or permit to exist any Debt
or liability on account of deposits except: (i) the Obligations, (ii) the

          (a) The servicing, administration and collection of the Receivables
shall be conducted by such Person (the "SERVICER") so designated from time to
time in accordance with this Section 8.1. Converting is hereby designated as,
and hereby agrees to perform the duties and obligations of, the Servicer
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. After the occurrence of an Amortization

Converting or any successor Servicer PROVIDED THAT the Rating Agency Condition

Liquidity Banks, Converting shall not be permitted to delegate any of its duties

in accordance with its customary practices. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so
long as Converting remains the Servicer hereunder: (i) Converting shall be and
remain liable to the Agents and the Lenders for the full and prompt performance
of all duties and responsibilities of the Servicer hereunder and (ii) the Agents
and the Lenders shall be entitled to deal exclusively with Converting in matters
relating to the discharge by the Servicer of its duties and responsibilities
hereunder.

     Section 8.2 Duties of Servicer.

          (a) The Servicer shall take or cause to be taken all such actions as
may be necessary or advisable to collect each Receivable from time to time, all
in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, with reasonable care
and diligence, and in accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy.

          (b) The Servicer will instruct all Obligors to pay all Collections
directly to a Lock-Box or Collection Account. The Servicer shall effect a
Collection Account Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit VIII to the
Receivables Sale Agreement with each bank party to a Collection Account at any
time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Collection Account at Wachovia need not be
subject to a Collection Account Agreement until December 9, 2005. In the case of
any remittances received in any Lock-Box or Collection Account that shall have
been identified, to the satisfaction of the Servicer, to not constitute
Collections or other proceeds of the Receivables or the Related Security, the
Servicer shall promptly remit such items to the Person identified to it as being
the owner of such remittances. From and after the date the Administrative Agent
delivers to any Collection Bank a Collection Notice pursuant to Section 8.3, any
Agent may request that the Servicer, and the Servicer thereupon promptly shall
instruct all Obligors with respect to the Receivables, to remit all payments
thereon to a new depositary account specified by the Administrative Agent and,
at all times thereafter, Borrower and the Servicer shall not deposit or
otherwise credit, and shall not permit any other Person to deposit or otherwise
credit to such new depositary account any cash or payment item other than
Collections.

24

(c) The Servicer shall administer the Collections in accordance with
the procedures described herein and in Article II. The Servicer shall set aside
and hold in trust for the account of Borrower and the Lenders their respective
shares of the Collections in accordance with Article II. The Servicer shall,
upon the request of any Agent, segregate, in a manner acceptable to the Agents,
all cash, checks and other instruments received by it from time to time
constituting Collections from the general funds of the Servicer or Borrower
prior to the remittance thereof in accordance with Article II. If the Servicer
shall be required to segregate Collections pursuant to the preceding sentence,
the Servicer shall segregate and deposit with a bank designated by the
Administrative Agent such allocable share of Collections of Receivables set
aside for the Lenders on the first Business Day following receipt by the
Servicer of such Collections, duly endorsed or with duly executed instruments of
transfer.

          (d) The Servicer may, in accordance with the Credit and Collection
Policy, extend the maturity of any Receivable or adjust the Outstanding Balance
of any Receivable as the Servicer determines to be appropriate to maximize
Collections thereof; PROVIDED, however, that such extension or adjustment shall
not alter the status of such Receivable as a Delinquent Receivable or Defaulted
Receivable or limit the rights of the Agents or the Lenders under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, from and
after the occurrence of an Amortization Event, the Administrative Agent shall
have the absolute and unlimited right to direct the Servicer to commence or
settle any legal action with respect to any Receivable or to foreclose upon or
repossess any Related Security.

          (e) The Servicer shall hold in trust for Borrower and the Lenders all
Records that (i) evidence or relate to the Receivables, the related Contracts
and Related Security or (ii) are otherwise necessary or desirable to collect the
Receivables and shall, as soon as practicable upon demand of the Administrative
Agent following the occurrence of an Amortization Event, deliver or make
available to the Administrative Agent all such Records, at a place selected by
the Administrative Agent. The Servicer shall, as soon as practicable following
receipt thereof turn over to Borrower any cash collections or other cash
proceeds received with respect to Debt not constituting Receivables or proceeds
of Collateral. The Servicer shall, from time to time at the request of any
Lender, furnish to the Lenders (promptly after any such request) a calculation
of the amounts set aside for the Lenders pursuant to Article II.

          (f) Any payment by an Obligor in respect of any indebtedness owed by
it to Originator or Borrower shall, except as otherwise specified by such
Obligor or otherwise required by contract or law and unless otherwise instructed
by a Co-Agent, be applied as a Collection of any Receivable of such Obligor
(starting with the oldest such Receivable) to the extent of any amounts then due
and payable thereunder before being applied to any other receivable or other
obligation of such Obligor.

     Section 8.3 Collection Notices. The Administrative Agent and, if
applicable, the TPF Agent are authorized at any time after the occurrence of an
Amortization Event to date and to deliver to the Collection Banks the Collection
Notices. Borrower hereby transfers to the Administrative Agent and, if
applicable, the TPF Agent for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders,
effective when the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, the TPF Agent
delivers such notice, the exclusive ownership and control of each Lock-Box and
the Collection Accounts. In case any authorized signatory of Borrower whose
signature appears on a Collection Account

25

Agreement shall cease to have such authority before the delivery of such notice,
such Collection Notice shall nevertheless be valid as if such authority had
remained in force. Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent, and
agrees that the Administrative Agent shall be entitled (i) at any time after
delivery of the Collection Notices, to endorse Borrower's name on checks and
other instruments representing Collections, (ii) at any time after the
occurrence of an Amortization Event, to enforce the Receivables, the related
Contracts and the Related Security, and (iii) at any time after the occurrence
of an Amortization Event, to take such action as shall be necessary or desirable
to cause all cash, checks and other instruments constituting Collections of
Receivables to come into the possession of the Administrative Agent rather than
Borrower.

     Section 8.4 Responsibilities of Borrower. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, the exercise by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the
Co-Agents and the Lenders of their rights hereunder shall not release the
Servicer, any Originator or Borrower from any of their duties or obligations
with respect to any Receivables or under the related Contracts. The Lenders
shall have no obligation or liability with respect to any Receivables or related
Contracts, nor shall any of them be obligated to perform the obligations of
Borrower. Moreover, the ultimate responsibility for the servicing of the
Receivables shall be borne by Borrower.

     Section 8.5 Monthly Reports. The Servicer shall prepare and forward to the
Agents (i) on each Monthly Reporting Date, a Monthly Report and an electronic
file of the data contained therein and (ii) at such times as the Co-Agents shall
reasonably request, a listing by Obligor of all Receivables together with an
aging of such Receivables.

     Section 8.6 Servicing Fee. As compensation for the Servicer's servicing
activities on their behalf, Borrower shall pay the Servicer the Servicing Fee,
which fee shall be paid from Collections in arrears on each Settlement Date.

                                   ARTICLE IX.

     Section 10.1 Indemnities by the Loan Parties. Without limiting any other
rights that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have hereunder or under
applicable law, (A) Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify (and pay upon demand to)
each of the Agents, each of the Conduits, each of the Liquidity Banks and each
of the respective assigns, officers, directors, agents and employees of the
foregoing (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from and against any and all damages,
losses, claims, taxes, liabilities, costs, expenses and for all other amounts
payable, including reasonable attorneys' fees actually incurred (which attorneys
may be employees of the Administrative Agent or such Lender) and disbursements
(all of the foregoing being collectively referred to as "INDEMNIFIED AMOUNTS")
awarded against or incurred by any of them arising out of or as a result of this
Agreement or the acquisition, either directly or indirectly, by a Lender of an
interest in the Receivables, and (B) the Servicer hereby agrees to indemnify
(and pay upon demand to) each Indemnified Party for Indemnified Amounts awarded
against or incurred by any of them arising out of the Servicer's activities as
Servicer hereunder EXCLUDING, HOWEVER, in all of the foregoing instances under
the preceding clauses (A) and (B):

29

negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Indemnified Party seeking
indemnification;

          (b) Indemnified Amounts to the extent the same includes losses in
respect of Receivables that are uncollectible on account of the insolvency,

under the terms of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing indemnification, Borrower shall indemnify the Agents and the Lenders
for Indemnified Amounts (including, without limitation, losses in respect of
uncollectible receivables, regardless of whether reimbursement therefor would
constitute recourse to such Loan Party) relating to or resulting from:

     Originator (or any officers of any such Person) under or in connection with
     this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or any other information or

     or regulation or any failure of any Originator to keep or perform any of
     its obligations, express or implied, with respect to any Contract;

               (iii) any failure of Borrower, the Servicer or any Originator to
     perform its duties, covenants or other obligations in accordance with the
     provisions of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document;

               (iv) any products liability, personal injury or damage suit, or
     other similar claim arising out of or in connection with merchandise,
     insurance or services that are the subject of any Contract or any
     Receivable;

     related to the financial condition, or discharge in bankruptcy, of the
     Obligor) of the Obligor to the payment of any Receivable (including,
     without limitation, a defense based on such Receivable or the related
     Contract not being a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Obligor
     enforceable against it in accordance with its terms), or any other claim
     resulting from the sale of the

30

merchandise or service related to such Receivable or the furnishing or
     failure to furnish such merchandise or services;

               (vi) the commingling of Collections of Receivables at any time

     transactions contemplated hereby, the use of the proceeds of any Advance,
     the Collateral or any other investigation, litigation or proceeding
     relating to Borrower, the Servicer or any Originator in which any
     Indemnified Party becomes involved as a result of any of the transactions
     contemplated hereby;

               (viii) any inability to litigate any claim against any Obligor in
     respect of any Receivable as a result of such Obligor being immune from
     civil and commercial law and suit on the grounds of sovereignty or
     otherwise from any legal action, suit or proceeding;

               (ix) any Amortization Event;

               (x) any failure of Borrower to acquire and maintain legal and
     equitable title to, and ownership of any of the Collateral from the
     applicable Originator, free and clear of any Adverse Claim (other than as
     created hereunder); or any failure of Borrower to give reasonably
     equivalent value to any Originator under the Receivables Sale Agreement in
     consideration of the transfer by such Originator of any Receivable, or any
     attempt by any Person to void such transfer under statutory provisions or
     common law or equitable action;

               (xi) any failure to vest and maintain vested in the
     Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders, or to transfer to the
     Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a valid first
     priority perfected security interests in the Collateral, free and clear of
     any Adverse Claim (except as created by the Transaction Documents);

               (xii) the failure to have filed, or any delay in filing,
     financing statements or other similar instruments or documents under the

     any Collateral, and the proceeds thereof, whether at the time of any
     Advance or at any subsequent time;

               (xiii) any action or omission by any Loan Party which reduces or
     impairs the rights of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders with respect
     to any Collateral or the value of any Collateral;

               (xiv) any attempt by any Person to void any Advance or the
     Administrative Agent's security interest in the Collateral under statutory
     provisions or common law or equitable action; and

               (xv) the failure of any Receivable included in the calculation of
     the Net Pool Balance as an Eligible Receivable to be an Eligible Receivable
     at the time so included.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the foregoing indemnification is not intended
to, and shall not, constitute a guarantee of the collectibility or payment of
the Receivables; and (B) nothing in

31

this Section 10.1 shall require Borrower to indemnify the Indemnified Parties
for Receivables which are not collected, not paid or otherwise uncollectible on
account of the insolvency, bankruptcy, credit-worthiness or financial inability
to pay of the applicable Obligor.

     Section 10.2 Increased Cost and Reduced Return. If after the date hereof,
any Funding Source shall be charged any fee, expense or increased cost on
account of any Regulatory Change (i) that subjects any Funding Source to any
charge or withholding on or with respect to any Funding Agreement or a Funding
Source's obligations under a Funding Agreement, or on or with respect to the
Receivables, or changes the basis of taxation of payments to any Funding Source
of any amounts payable under any Funding Agreement (except for changes in the
rate of tax on the overall net income of a Funding Source or taxes excluded by
Section 10.1) or (ii) that imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve,
assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against
assets of, deposits with or for the account of a Funding Source, or credit
extended by a Funding Source pursuant to a Funding Agreement or (iii) that
imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase the cost to a
Funding Source of performing its obligations under a Funding Agreement, or to
reduce the rate of return on a Funding Source's capital as a consequence of its
obligations under a Funding Agreement, or to reduce the amount of any sum
received or receivable by a Funding Source under a Funding Agreement or to
require any payment calculated by reference to the amount of interests or loans
held or interest received by it, then, upon demand by the applicable Co-Agent,
Borrower shall pay to such Co-Agent, for the benefit of the relevant Funding
Source, such amounts charged to such Funding Source or such amounts to otherwise
compensate such Funding Source for such increased cost or such reduction.

     Section 10.3 Other Costs and Expenses. Subject to Section 7.1(d), Borrower
shall pay to the Agents and the Conduits on demand all costs and out-of-pocket
expenses in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery and
administration of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby and the
other documents to be delivered hereunder, including without limitation, the
reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of legal counsel for the Agents and

among the remaining Liquidity Banks, a successor Administrative Agent, whereupon
such successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and
duties of the Administrative Agent and the term "Administrative Agent" shall
mean such successor agent, effective upon its appointment, and the former

          (d) No Loan Party may assign any of its rights or obligations under
this Agreement without the prior written consent of each of the Agents and each

a Participant, such Liquidity Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement
and such Liquidity Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Liquidity Bank shall
remain solely responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder and
under the Liquidity Agreement, and the Loan Parties, the Conduits and the Agents
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Liquidity Bank in
connection with such Liquidity Bank's rights and obligations under this
Agreement and the applicable Liquidity Agreement. Each Liquidity Bank agrees
that any agreement between such Liquidity Bank and any such Participant in

EXHIBIT VII

                         FORM OF PERFORMANCE UNDERTAKING

          THIS PERFORMANCE UNDERTAKING (this "UNDERTAKING"), dated as of October

AGREEMENT"), pursuant to which Originators, subject to the terms and conditions
contained therein, are dividending all of their respective right, title and
interest in certain of their accounts receivable to Parent, which Parent is then

due and punctual performance (a) by Originators of their obligations under the
Sale Agreement, (b) by each Originator, of its obligations in respect of any
demand loan made by Recipient to such Originator, and (c) by each Originator of
its Servicing Related Obligations (as hereinafter defined).

          4. Performance Guarantor wishes to guaranty the due and punctual
performance by Originators of the obligations described in clause 3 above as
provided herein.

                                    AGREEMENT

          NOW, THEREFORE, Performance Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:

          Section 1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined
herein shall the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Sale Agreement or

Restated Credit and Security Agreement, dated as of October 26, 2005 by and
among Recipient, as Borrower, Rock-Tenn Converting Company, as Servicer, the
Lenders party thereto, the Co-Agents party thereto and Wachovia Bank, National
Association, as Administrative Agent for such Co-Agents and such Lenders, as
amended, restated or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with the
terms thereof.

          "GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS" means, collectively:

          (a) all covenants, agreements, terms, conditions and indemnities to be
performed and observed by any Originator under and pursuant to the Sale
Agreement and each other document executed and delivered by any Originator
pursuant to the Sale Agreement, including, without limitation, the due and
punctual payment of all sums which are or may become due and owing by any
Originator under the Sale Agreement, whether for fees, expenses (including
reasonable counsel fees), indemnified amounts or otherwise, whether upon any
termination or for any other reason;

          (b) all obligations of any Originator to repay, upon demand, all
principal of and interest on any demand loan or demand advance made by Recipient
to such Originator on any date after the date hereof [(except for loans made
pursuant to that Line of Credit Loan Agreement, date as of the date hereof, by

          (c) all Servicing Related Obligations.

          "SERVICING RELATED OBLIGATIONS" means, collectively, all obligations
of Rock-Tenn Converting Company as Servicer under the Credit and Security

     Section 2. Guaranty of Performance of Guaranteed Obligations. Performance
Guarantor hereby guarantees to Recipient, the full and punctual payment and
performance by each Originator of its respective Guaranteed Obligations. This
Undertaking is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guaranty of the full
and punctual performance of all Guaranteed Obligations of each Originator under
the Agreements and each other document executed and delivered by any Originator
pursuant to the Agreements and is in no way conditioned upon any requirement
that Recipient first attempt to collect any amounts owing by any Originator to
Recipient, the Agents or the Lenders from any other Person or resort to any
collateral security, any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books
of Recipient, the Agents or any Lender in favor of any Originator or any other
Person or other means of obtaining payment. Should any Originator default in the
payment or performance of any of its Guaranteed Obligations, Recipient (or its
assigns) may cause the immediate performance by Performance Guarantor of the
Guaranteed Obligations and cause any payment Guaranteed Obligations to become
forthwith due and payable to Recipient (or its assigns), without demand or
notice of any nature (other than as expressly provided herein), all of which are
hereby expressly waived by Performance Guarantor.

83

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Undertaking is not a guarantee of the
collection of any of the Receivables and Performance Guarantor shall not be
responsible for any Guaranteed Obligations to the extent the failure to perform
such Guaranteed Obligations by any Originator results from Receivables being
uncollectible on account of the insolvency, bankruptcy or lack of
creditworthiness of the related Obligor; PROVIDED THAT nothing herein shall
relieve any Originator from performing in full its Guaranteed Obligations under
the Agreements or Performance Guarantor of its undertaking hereunder with
respect to the full performance of such duties.

     Section 3. Performance Guarantor's Further Agreements to Pay. Performance
Guarantor further agrees, as the principal obligor and not as a guarantor only,
to pay to Recipient (and its assigns), forthwith upon demand in funds
immediately available to Recipient, all reasonable costs and expenses (including
court costs and reasonable legal expenses) incurred or expended by Recipient in
connection with the Guaranteed Obligations, this Undertaking and the enforcement
thereof, together with interest on amounts recoverable under this Undertaking
from the time when such amounts become due until payment, at a rate of interest
(computed for the actual number of days elapsed based on a 360 day year) equal
to the Prime Rate plus 2% per annum, such rate of interest changing when and as
the Prime Rate changes.

     Section 4. Waivers by Performance Guarantor. Performance Guarantor waives
notice of acceptance of this Undertaking, notice of any action taken or omitted
by Recipient (or its assigns) in reliance on this Undertaking, and any
requirement that Recipient (or its assigns) be diligent or prompt in making
demands under this Undertaking, giving notice of any Termination Event,
Amortization Event, other default or omission by any Originator or asserting any
other rights of Recipient under this Undertaking. Performance Guarantor warrants
that it has adequate means to obtain from each Originator, on a continuing
basis, information concerning the financial condition of such Originator, and
that it is not relying on Recipient to provide such information, now or in the
future. Performance Guarantor also irrevocably waives all defenses (i) that at
any time may be available in respect of the Obligations by virtue of any statute
of limitations, valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or
hereafter in effect or (ii) that arise under the law of suretyship, including
impairment of collateral. Recipient (and its assigns) shall be at liberty,
without giving notice to or obtaining the assent of Performance Guarantor and
without relieving Performance Guarantor of any liability under this Undertaking,
to deal with each Originator and with each other party who now is or after the
date hereof becomes liable in any manner for any of the Guaranteed Obligations,
in such manner as Recipient in its sole discretion deems fit, and to this end
Performance Guarantor agrees that the validity and enforceability of this
Undertaking, including without limitation, the provisions of Section 7 hereof,
shall not be impaired or affected by any of the following: (a) any extension,
modification or renewal of, or indulgence with respect to, or substitutions for,
the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto
at any time; (b) any failure or omission to enforce any right, power or remedy
with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement
relating thereto, or any collateral securing the Guaranteed Obligations or any
part thereof; (c) any waiver of any right, power or remedy or of any Termination
Event, Amortization Event, or default with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations
or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto; (d) any release,
surrender, compromise, settlement, waiver, subordination or modification, with
or without consideration, of any other obligation of any person or entity with
respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (e) the
enforceability or validity of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or
the

84

genuineness, enforceability or validity of any agreement relating thereto or
with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (f) the
application of payments received from any source to the payment of any payment
Obligations of any Originator or any part thereof or amounts which are not
covered by this Undertaking even though Recipient (or its assigns) might
lawfully have elected to apply such payments to any part or all of the payment
Obligations of such Originator or to amounts which are not covered by this
Undertaking; (g) the existence of any claim, setoff or other rights which
Performance Guarantor may have at any time against any Originator in connection
herewith or any unrelated transaction; (h) any assignment or transfer of the
Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; or (i) any failure on the part of
any Originator to perform or comply with any term of the Agreements or any other
document executed in connection therewith or delivered thereunder, all whether
or not Performance Guarantor shall have had notice or knowledge of any act or
omission referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) through (i) of this Section 4.

     Section 5. Unenforceability of Guaranteed Obligations Against Originators.
Notwithstanding (a) any change of ownership of any Originator or the insolvency,
bankruptcy or any other change in the legal status of any Originator; (b) the
change in or the imposition of any law, decree, regulation or other governmental
act which does or might impair, delay or in any way affect the validity,
enforceability or the payment when due of the Guaranteed Obligations; (c) the
failure of any Originator or Performance Guarantor to maintain in full force,
validity or effect or to obtain or renew when required all governmental and
other approvals, licenses or consents required in connection with the Guaranteed
Obligations or this Undertaking, or to take any other action required in
connection with the performance of all obligations pursuant to the Guaranteed
Obligations or this Undertaking; or (d) if any of the moneys included in the
Guaranteed Obligations have become irrecoverable from any Originator for any
other reason other than final payment in full of the payment Obligations in
accordance with their terms, this Undertaking shall nevertheless be binding on
Performance Guarantor. This Undertaking shall be in addition to any other
guaranty or other security for the Guaranteed Obligations, and it shall not be
rendered unenforceable by the invalidity of any such other guaranty or security.
In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any
Originator or for any other reason with respect to any Originator, all such
amounts then due and owing with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations under the
terms of the Agreements, or any other agreement evidencing, securing or
otherwise executed in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations, shall be
immediately due and payable by Performance Guarantor.

     Section 6. Representations and Warranties. Performance Guarantor hereby
represents and warrants to Recipient that:

          (a) Existence and Standing. Performance Guarantor is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
state of incorporation. Performance Guarantor is duly qualified to do business
and is in good standing as a foreign corporation, and has and holds all
corporate power and all governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and
approvals required to carry on its business in each jurisdiction in which its
business is conducted except where the failure to so qualify or so hold would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

85

(b) Authorization, Execution and Delivery; Binding Effect. The
execution and delivery by Performance Guarantor of this Undertaking, and the
performance of its obligations hereunder, are within its corporate powers and
authority and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on its
part. This Undertaking has been duly executed and delivered by Performance
Guarantor. This Undertaking constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation
of Performance Guarantor enforceable against Performance Guarantor in accordance
with their respective terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws relating
to or limiting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

          (c) No Conflict; Government Consent. The execution and delivery by
Performance Guarantor of this Undertaking, and the performance of its
obligations hereunder do not contravene or violate (i) its certificate or
articles of incorporation or by-laws, (ii) any law, rule or regulation
applicable to it, (iii) any restrictions under any agreement, contract or
instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its property is
bound, or (iv) any order, writ, judgment, award, injunction or decree binding on
or affecting it or its property, and do not result in the creation or imposition
of any Adverse Claim on assets of Performance Guarantor or its Subsidiaries
(except as created hereunder) except, in any case, where such contravention or
violation would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (d) Financial Statements. The consolidated financial statements of
Performance Guarantor and its consolidated Subsidiaries dated as of June 30,
2005 heretofore delivered to Recipient have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied and fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial condition and results of
operations of Performance Guarantor and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of such
dates and for the periods ended on such dates. Since the later of (i) June 30,
2005 and (ii) the last time this representation was made or deemed made, no
event has occurred which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

          (e) Taxes. Performance Guarantor has filed all United States federal
tax returns and all other tax returns which are required to be filed and have
paid all taxes due pursuant to said returns or pursuant to any assessment
received by Performance Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries, except such taxes,
if any, as are being contested in good faith and as to which adequate reserves
have been provided. No federal or state tax liens have been filed and no claims
are being asserted with respect to any such taxes. The charges, accruals and
reserves on the books of Performance Guarantor in respect of any taxes or other
governmental charges are adequate.

          (f) Litigation and Contingent Obligations. Except as disclosed in the
filings made by Performance Guarantor with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the best
of Performance Guarantor's knowledge threatened against or affecting Performance
Guarantor or any of its properties, in or before any court, arbitrator or other
body, that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (i)
the business, properties, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of
operations of Performance Guarantor and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (ii)
the ability of Performance Guarantor to perform its obligations under this
Undertaking, or (iii) the validity or enforceability

86

of any of this Undertaking or the rights or remedies of Recipient hereunder.
Performance Guarantor does not have any material Contingent Obligations not
provided for or disclosed in the financial statements referred to in Section
6(d).

     Section 7. Subrogation; Subordination. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, until the Guaranteed Obligations are paid in full
Performance Guarantor: (a) will not enforce or otherwise exercise any right of
subrogation to any of the rights of Recipient, the Agents or any Lender against
any Originator, (b) hereby waives all rights of subrogation (whether
contractual, under Section 509 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, at law or
in equity or otherwise) to the claims of Recipient, the Agents and the Lenders
against any Originator and all contractual, statutory or legal or equitable
rights of contribution, reimbursement, indemnification and similar rights and
"claims" (as that term is defined in the United States Bankruptcy Code) which
Performance Guarantor might now have or hereafter acquire against any Originator
that arise from the existence or performance of Performance Guarantor's
obligations hereunder, (c) will not claim any setoff, recoupment or counterclaim
against any Originator in respect of any liability of Performance Guarantor to
such Originator and (d) waives any benefit of and any right to participate in
any collateral security which may be held by Recipient, the Agents or the
Lenders. The payment of any amounts due with respect to any indebtedness of any
Originator now or hereafter owed to Performance Guarantor is hereby subordinated
to the prior payment in full of all of the Guaranteed Obligations. Performance
Guarantor agrees that, after the occurrence of any default in the payment or
performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, Performance Guarantor will not
demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any such indebtedness of any
Originator to Performance Guarantor until all of the Guaranteed Obligations
shall have been paid and performed in full. If, notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, Performance Guarantor shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts in
respect of such indebtedness while any Obligations are still unperformed or
outstanding, such amounts shall be collected, enforced and received by
Performance Guarantor as trustee for Recipient (and its assigns) and be paid
over to Recipient (or its assigns) on account of the Guaranteed Obligations
without affecting in any manner the liability of Performance Guarantor under the
other provisions of this Undertaking. The provisions of this Section 7 shall be
supplemental to and not in derogation of any rights and remedies of Recipient
under any separate subordination agreement which Recipient may at any time and
from time to time enter into with Performance Guarantor.

     Section 8. Termination of Performance Undertaking. Performance Guarantor's
obligations hereunder shall continue in full force and effect until all
Obligations are finally paid and satisfied in full and the Credit and Security
Agreement is terminated, PROVIDED THAT this Undertaking shall continue to be
effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment or
other satisfaction of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must
otherwise be restored or returned upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, or
reorganization of any Originator or otherwise, as though such payment had not
been made or other satisfaction occurred, whether or not Recipient (or its
assigns) is in possession of this Undertaking. No invalidity, irregularity or
unenforceability by reason of the Bankruptcy Code or any insolvency or other
similar law, or any law or order of any government or agency thereof purporting
to reduce, amend or otherwise affect the Guaranteed Obligations shall impair,
affect, be a defense to or claim against the obligations of Performance
Guarantor under this Undertaking.

87

Section 9. Effect of Bankruptcy. This Performance Undertaking shall survive
the insolvency of any Originator and the commencement of any case or proceeding
by or against any Originator under the Bankruptcy Code or other federal, state
or other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization statutes. No
automatic stay under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to any Originator or other
federal, state or other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization
statutes to which any Originator is subject shall postpone the obligations of
Performance Guarantor under this Undertaking.

     Section 10. Setoff. Regardless of the other means of obtaining payment of
any of the Guaranteed Obligations, Recipient (and its assigns) is hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, without notice to Performance
Guarantor (any such notice being expressly waived by Performance Guarantor) and
to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any deposits and
other sums against the obligations of Performance Guarantor under this
Undertaking, whether or not Recipient (or any such assign) shall have made any
demand under this Undertaking and although such Obligations may be contingent or
unmatured.

     Section 11. Taxes. All payments to be made by Performance Guarantor
hereunder shall be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding. If
Performance Guarantor is required by law to make any deduction or withholding on
account of tax or otherwise from any such payment, the sum due from it in
respect of such payment shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure
that, after the making of such deduction or withholding, Recipient receive a net
sum equal to the sum which they would have received had no deduction or
withholding been made.

     Section 12. Further Assurances. Performance Guarantor agrees that it will
from time to time, at the request of Recipient (or its assigns), provide
information relating to the business and affairs of Performance Guarantor as
Recipient may reasonably request. Performance Guarantor also agrees to do all
such things and execute all such documents as Recipient (or its assigns) may
reasonably consider necessary or desirable to give full effect to this
Undertaking and to perfect and preserve the rights and powers of Recipient
hereunder.

     Section 13. Successors and Assigns. This Performance Undertaking shall be
binding upon Performance Guarantor, its successors and permitted assigns, and
shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Recipient and its successors
and assigns. Performance Guarantor may not assign or transfer any of its
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each of Recipient and
each Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, Recipient
may assign or otherwise transfer the Agreements, any other documents executed in
connection therewith or delivered thereunder or any other agreement or note held
by them evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with the
Guaranteed Obligations, or sell participations in any interest therein, to any
other entity or other person, and such other entity or other person shall
thereupon become vested, to the extent set forth in the agreement evidencing
such assignment, transfer or participation, with all the rights in respect
thereof granted to the Recipient herein.

     Section 14. Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any provision
of this Undertaking nor consent to any departure by Performance Guarantor
therefrom shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
Recipient, the Agents and

88

Performance Guarantor. No failure on the part of Recipient to exercise, and no
delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.

     Section 15. Notices. All notices and other communications provided for
hereunder shall be made in writing and shall be addressed as follows: if to
Performance Guarantor, at the address set forth beneath its signature hereto,
and if to Recipient, at the addresses set forth beneath its signature hereto, or
at such other addresses as each of Performance Guarantor or any Recipient may
designate in writing to the other. Each such notice or other communication shall
be effective (1) if given by telecopy, upon the receipt thereof, (2) if given by
mail, three (3) Business Days after the time such communication is deposited in
the mail with first class postage prepaid or (3) if given by any other means,
when received at the address specified in this Section 15.

     Section 16. GOVERNING LAW. THIS UNDERTAKING SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS (AND NOT THE LAW OF CONFLICTS) OF THE STATE OF
GEORGIA.

     Section 17. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. EACH OF PROVIDER AND RECIPIENT HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED STATES
FEDERAL OR GEORGIA STATE COURT SITTING IN THE FULTON COUNTY, GEORGIA, IN ANY
ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS UNDERTAKING, THE
AGREEMENTS OR ANY OTHER DOCUMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH OR DELIVERED
THEREUNDER AND EACH OF THE PERFORMANCE GUARANTOR AND RECIPIENT HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY
BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH COURT AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION
IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE AS TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT OR THAT SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

     Section 18. Bankruptcy Petition. Performance Guarantor hereby covenants and
agrees that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in
full of all outstanding senior Debt of Recipient, it will not institute against,
or join any other Person in instituting against, Recipient any bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or other
similar proceeding under the laws of the United States or any state of the
United States.

     Section 19. Miscellaneous. This Undertaking constitutes the entire
agreement of Performance Guarantor with respect to the matters set forth herein.
The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any
remedies provided by law or any other agreement, and this Undertaking shall be
in addition to any other guaranty of or collateral security for any of the
Guaranteed Obligations. The provisions of this Undertaking are severable, and in
any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state or
federal bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights
of creditors generally, if the obligations of Performance Guarantor hereunder
would otherwise be held or

89

determined to be avoidable, invalid or unenforceable on account of the amount of
Performance Guarantor's liability under this Undertaking, then, notwithstanding
any other provision of this Undertaking to the contrary, the amount of such
liability shall, without any further action by Performance Guarantor or
Recipient, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is
valid and enforceable as determined in such action or proceeding. Any provisions

laws of the state of its incorporation.

          (b) Each of the Loan Parties and Performance Guarantor has all
requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction where failure
to be so qualified would have a material adverse effect on such entity's
business.

          (c) The execution and delivery by each of the Loan Parties and
Performance Guarantor of the Transaction Document to which it is a party and its
performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by all
necessary organizational action and proceedings on the part of such entity and

               (i) require any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
     governmental body, agency or official (other than the filing of UCC
     financing statements);

               (ii) contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of
     applicable law or regulation or of its articles or certificate of
     incorporation or bylaws or of any agreement, judgment, injunction, order,
     decree or other instrument binding upon such entity; or

sought.

          (e) The provisions of the Credit and Security Agreement are effective
to create valid security interests in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the
benefit of the Secured Parties, in all of Borrower's right, title and interest
in and to the Receivables and Related Security described therein which
constitute "accounts" or "general intangibles" (each as defined in the UCC)
(collectively, the "OPINION COLLATERAL"), as security for the payment of the
Obligations.

93

(f) Each of the UCC-1 Financing Statements naming Borrower as debtor,
and Agent, as secured party, to be filed in the [describe filing offices], is in
appropriate form for filing therein. Upon filing of such UCC-1 Financing
Statements in such filing offices and payment of the required filing fees, the
security interest in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the
Secured Parties, in the Opinion Collateral will be perfected.

          (g) Based solely on our review of the [describe UCC Search Reports],
and assuming (i) the filing of the Financing Statements and payment of the
required filing fees in accordance with paragraph (f) and (ii) the absence of
any intervening filings between the date and time of the Search Reports and the
date and time of the filing of the Financing Statements, the security interest
of the Administrative Agent in the Opinion Collateral is prior to any security
interest granted in the Opinion Collateral by Borrower, the priority of which is
determined solely by the filing of a financing statement in the [describe filing
offices].

          (h) Neither of the Loan Parties is a "holding company" or a
"subsidiary holding company" of a "holding company" within the meaning of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, or an "investment

AMENDED AND RESTATED RECEIVABLES SALE AGREEMENT

          THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED RECEIVABLES SALE AGREEMENT, dated as of
October 26, 2005, is by and among:

          (a) Rock-Tenn Company, a Georgia corporation ("PARENT"),

          (b) Rock-Tenn Company of Texas, a Georgia corporation, Rock-Tenn
Converting Company, a Georgia corporation, Rock-Tenn Mill Company, LLC, a
Georgia limited liability company, Rock-Tenn Packaging and Paperboard, LLC, a
Georgia limited liability company, PCPC, Inc., a California corporation, and
Waldorf Corporation, a Delaware corporation (each of the foregoing, an
"ORIGINATOR" and collectively, the "ORIGINATORS"), and

          (c) Rock-Tenn Financial, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("BUYER"),

and amends and restates in its entirety that certain Receivables Sale Agreement
dated as of November 1, 2000 by and among Parent, certain of the Originators (or
their predecessors) and Buyer (the "EXISTING AGREEMENT").

UNLESS DEFINED ELSEWHERE HEREIN, CAPITALIZED TERMS USED IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL
HAVE THE MEANINGS ASSIGNED TO SUCH TERMS IN EXHIBIT I HERETO.

                             PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS

          Each of the Originators now owns, and from time to time hereafter will
own, Receivables.

          On the date of the Existing Agreement, each of the Originators party
to the Existing Agreement made a dividend to Parent of all of such Originator's
right, title and interest in and to 100% of its Receivables in existence as of
the close of business on its Initial Cutoff Date, together with the associated
Related Security and Collections, and Parent contributed all of such Receivables
and the associated Related Security and Collections to Buyer's capital (such
Receivables, the "INITIAL CONTRIBUTED RECEIVABLES" and, together with the
associated Related Security and Collections, the "INITIAL CONTRIBUTED ASSETS")
in exchange for 100% of the authorized Equity Interests of Buyer.

          Parent intended the contribution of the Initial Contributed Assets to
be an absolute conveyance by Parent to Buyer thereof, providing Buyer with the
full benefits of ownership of such Initial Contributed Assets, and neither
Parent nor Buyer intended such contribution to be, or for any purpose to be
characterized as, a loan from Buyer to Parent.

          Each of the Originators wishes to sell and assign to Buyer, and Buyer
wishes to purchase from each Originator, all of such Originator's right, title
and

interest in and to its Receivables (other than Initial Contributed Receivables),
together with the Related Security and Collections with respect thereto.

          Each of the Originators and Buyer intend the transactions contemplated
hereby to be true sales to Buyer by such Originator of the Receivables
originated by it, providing Buyer with the full benefits of ownership of such
Receivables, and none of the Originators nor Buyer intends these transactions to
be, or for any purpose to be characterized as, loans from Buyer to such
Originator.

          Buyer may finance its purchase of Receivables from the Originators, in
part, by borrowing pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Credit and
Security Agreement dated as of October 26, 2005 (as amended, restated, replaced
and/or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with the terms
thereof, the "CREDIT AND SECURITY AGREEMENT") among Buyer, Rock-Tenn Converting
Company, as initial Servicer, Blue Ridge Asset Funding Corporation, Three
Pillars Funding LLC, SunTrust Bank, SunTrust Capital Markets, Inc., as TPF
Agent, and Wachovia Bank, National Association, individually, as Blue Ridge
Agent and as administrative agent (in such last capacity, the "ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT").

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
mutual agreements herein contained and other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I
                        AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF THE PURCHASE

     Section 1.1 Initial Dividend and Contribution of Receivables. On the date
hereof:

          (a) Each of the Originators party to the Existing Agreement confirms
that it made a dividend to Parent of the Initial Contributed Assets; and

          (b) Parent hereby confirms that it contributed, assigned, transferred,
set-over and otherwise conveyed to Buyer, and Buyer hereby confirms that it
accepted from Parent, the Initial Contributed Assets, in exchange for the
issuance of 100% of Buyer's Equity Interests.

          (c) It is the intention of the parties hereto that (i) the
distribution by each Originator party to the Existing Agreement to Parent of the
Initial Contributed Assets originated by such Originator, and (ii) the
subsequent contribution thereof by Parent to Buyer hereunder, each constituted
an outright assignment of such Initial Contributed Assets, which assignment was
absolute and irrevocable and provided Buyer with the full benefits of ownership
of the Initial Contributed Assets. The distribution to Parent of Initial
Contributed Assets

2

originated by each such Originator was made without recourse to such Originator,
and the contribution of such Initial Contributed Assets to Buyer was made
without recourse to Parent; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) such Originator remains
liable to Parent and its assigns for all representations, warranties, covenants
and indemnities made by such Originator pursuant to the terms of the Transaction
Documents to which such Originator is a party, (ii) Parent remains liable to
Buyer and its assigns for all representations, warranties, covenants and
indemnities made by Parent, and (iii) such distribution and contribution did not
constitute and were not intended to result in an assumption by Buyer or any
assignee thereof of any obligation of such Originator or any other Person
arising in connection with the Initial Contributed Assets or any other
obligations of such Originator. Each Originator party to the Existing Agreement
and Parent agrees that it has, on or prior to the date hereof and in accordance
with Section 4.1(e)(ii), marked its master data processing records relating to
the Initial Contributed Assets originated (or, in the case of Parent,
contributed) by it with a legend acceptable to Buyer and to the Administrative
Agent (as Buyer's assignee), evidencing that Buyer has acquired such Initial
Contributed Assets as provided in this Agreement and to note in its financial
statements that the Initial Contributed Assets have been distributed to Parent
and contributed to Buyer's capital. Upon the request of Buyer or the
Administrative Agent (as Buyer's assignee), each Originator and Parent will
execute and file such financing or continuation statements, or amendments
thereto or assignments thereof, and such other instruments or notices, as may be
necessary or appropriate to perfect and maintain the perfection of Buyer's
ownership interest in the Initial Contributed Assets.

     Section 1.2 Purchase of Receivables (Other than Initial Contributed
Receivables).

          (a) In consideration for the Purchase Price paid to each Originator
and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, each
Originator does hereby sell, assign, transfer, set-over and otherwise convey to
Buyer, without recourse (except to the extent expressly provided herein), and
Buyer does hereby purchase from such Originator, all of such Originator's right,
title and interest in and to all Receivables originated by such Originator and
existing as of the close of business on the Initial Cutoff Date (other than the
Initial Contributed Receivables) and all Receivables thereafter originated by
such Originator through and including the applicable Termination Date, together,
in each case, with all Related Security relating thereto and all Collections
thereof. In accordance with the preceding sentence, on the date hereof Buyer
shall acquire all of each Originator's right, title and interest in and to all
Receivables existing as of the Initial Cutoff Date (other than the Initial
Contributed Receivables) and thereafter arising through and including the
applicable Termination Date, together with all Related Security relating thereto
and all Collections thereof. Buyer shall be obligated to pay the

3

Purchase Price for the Receivables purchased hereunder from each Originator in
accordance with Section 1.3.

          (b) On the 15th day of each month hereafter (or if any such day is not
a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day thereafter, each Originator
shall (or shall require the Servicer to) deliver to Buyer a report in
substantially the form of Exhibit VII hereto (each such report being herein
called a "PURCHASE REPORT") with respect to the Receivables sold by such
Originator to Buyer during the Settlement Period then most recently ended. In
addition to, and not in limitation of, the foregoing, in connection with the
payment of the Purchase Price for any Receivables purchased hereunder, Buyer may
request that the applicable Originator deliver, and such Originator shall
deliver, such approvals, opinions, information or documents as Buyer may
reasonably request.

          (c) It is the intention of the parties hereto that the Purchase of
Receivables (other than Initial Contributed Receivables) from each Originator
hereunder shall constitute a sale, which sale is absolute and irrevocable and
provides Buyer with the full benefits of ownership of the Receivables (other
than Initial Contributed Receivables) originated by such Originator. Except for
the Purchase Price Credits owed to such Originator pursuant to Section 1.4, the
sale of Receivables hereunder by each Originator is made without recourse to
such Originator; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) such Originator shall be liable to
Buyer for all representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities made by
such Originator pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Documents to which such
Originator is a party, and (ii) such sale does not constitute and is not
intended to result in an assumption by Buyer or any assignee thereof of any
obligation of such Originator or any other Person arising in connection with
such Receivables, the related Contracts and/or other Related Security or any
other obligations of such Originator. In view of the intention of the parties
hereto that the sale of Receivables (other than Initial Contributed Receivables)
by each Originator hereunder shall constitute a sale of such Receivables rather
than loans secured thereby, each Originator agrees that it will, on or prior to
the date hereof and in accordance with Section 4.1(e)(ii), mark its master data
processing records relating to the Receivables (other than Initial Contributed
Receivables) originated by it with a legend acceptable to Buyer and to the
Administrative Agent (as Buyer's assignee), evidencing that Buyer has purchased
such Receivables as provided in this Agreement and to note in its financial
statements that its Receivables have been sold to Buyer. Upon the request of
Buyer or the Administrative Agent (as Buyer's assignee), each Originator will
execute and file such financing or continuation statements, or amendments
thereto or assignments thereof, and such other instruments or notices, as may be
necessary or appropriate to perfect and maintain the perfection of Buyer's
ownership interest in the Receivables (other than Initial Contributed
Receivables) originated by such

4

Originator and the Related Security and Collections with respect thereto, or as
Buyer or the Administrative Agent (as Buyer's assignee) may reasonably request.

     Section 1.3 Payment for the Purchases.

          (a) The Purchase Price for the Purchase from each Originator of its
Receivables in existence as of the close of business on the Initial Cutoff Date
(other than the Initial Contributed Receivables) shall be payable in full by
Buyer to such Originator on the date hereof, and shall be paid to such
Originator in the following manner:

               (i) by delivery of immediately available funds, to the extent of
     funds made available to Buyer in connection with its subsequent sale of an
     interest in such Receivables to the Lenders under the Credit and Security
     Agreement, and/or

               (ii) by delivery of the proceeds of a subordinated revolving loan
     from such Originator to Buyer (a "SUBORDINATED LOAN") in an amount not to
     exceed the least of (A) the remaining unpaid portion of such Purchase
     Price, (B) the maximum Subordinated Loan that could be borrowed without
     rendering Buyer's Net Worth less than the Required Capital Amount, and (C)
     thirty percent (30%) of such Purchase Price. Each Originator is hereby
     authorized by Buyer to endorse on the schedule attached to its Subordinated
     Note an appropriate notation evidencing the date and amount of each advance
     thereunder, as well as the date of each payment with respect thereto,
     PROVIDED THAT the failure to make such notation shall not affect any
     obligation of Buyer thereunder.

The Purchase Price for each Receivable coming into existence after the Initial
Cutoff Date shall be due and owing in full by Buyer to the applicable Originator
or its designee on the date each such Receivable came into existence (except
that Buyer may, with respect to any such Purchase Price, offset against such
Purchase Price any amounts owed by such Originator to Buyer hereunder and which
have become due but remain unpaid) and shall be paid to such Originator in the
manner provided in the following paragraphs (b), (c) and (d).

          (b) With respect to any Receivables coming into existence after the
Initial Cutoff Date, on each Settlement Date, Buyer shall pay the applicable
Originator the Purchase Price therefor in accordance with Section 1.3(d) and in
the following manner:

          FIRST, by delivery to the applicable Originator or its designee of
immediately available funds; and/or

5

SECOND, by delivery to the applicable Originator or its designee of
the proceeds of a Subordinated Loan, PROVIDED THAT the making of any such
Subordinated Loan shall be subject to the provisions set forth in Section
1.3(a)(ii).

Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 1.3(a)(ii), each Originator
irrevocably agrees to advance each Subordinated Loan requested by Buyer on or
prior to the applicable Termination Date. The Subordinated Loans owing to each
Originator shall be evidenced by, and shall be payable in accordance with the
terms and provisions of its Subordinated Note and shall be payable solely from
cash available to Buyer after payment of all amounts due in respect of the
Senior Claim (as defined in the Subordinated Note) or to become due in respect
of the Senior Claim within 30 days of the date of proposed payment on the
Subordinated Note.

          (c) From and after the applicable Termination Date, no Originator
shall be obligated to (but may, at its option) sell Receivables to Buyer.

          (d) Although the Purchase Price for each Receivable coming into
existence after the Initial Cutoff Date shall be due and payable in full by
Buyer to the applicable Originator on the date such Receivable came into
existence, settlement of the Purchase Price between Buyer and such Originator
shall be effected on a monthly basis on Settlement Dates with respect to all
Receivables originated by such Originator during the same Calculation Period and
based on the information contained in the Purchase Report delivered by such
Originator for the Calculation Period then most recently ended. Although
settlement shall be effected on Settlement Dates, increases or decreases in the
amount owing under the Subordinated Note made pursuant to Section 1.3 shall be
deemed to have occurred and shall be effective as of the last Business Day of
the Calculation Period to which such settlement relates.

     Section 1.4 Purchase Price Credit Adjustments. If on any day:

          (a) the Outstanding Balance of a Receivable purchased from any
Originator is:

               (i) reduced as a result of any defective or rejected or returned
     goods or services, any discount or any adjustment or otherwise by such
     Originator (other than as a result of a charge-off of such Receivable or
     cash Collections applied to such Receivable),

               (ii) reduced or canceled as a result of a setoff in respect of
     any claim by any Person (whether such claim arises out of the same or a
     related transaction or an unrelated transaction), or

          (b) any of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections
2.1(i), (j), (l), (r), (s), (t), (u), the second sentence of Section 2.1(q)
hereof is not true when made or deemed made with respect to any such Receivable,

6

then, in such event, Buyer shall be entitled to a credit (each, a "PURCHASE
PRICE CREDIT") against the Purchase Price otherwise payable to the applicable
Originator hereunder equal to the Outstanding Balance of such Receivable
(calculated before giving effect to the applicable reduction or cancellation).
If such Purchase Price Credit exceeds the Original Balance of the Receivables
originated by the applicable Originator on any day, such Originator shall pay
the remaining amount of such Purchase Price Credit in cash immediately, PROVIDED
THAT if the applicable Termination Date has not occurred, such Originator shall
be allowed to deduct the remaining amount of such Purchase Price Credit from any
indebtedness owed to it under its Subordinated Note.

     Section 1.5 Payments and Computations, Etc. All amounts to be paid or
deposited by Buyer hereunder shall be paid or deposited in accordance with the
terms hereof on the day when due in immediately available funds to the account
of the applicable Originator designated from time to time by such Originator or
as otherwise directed by such Originator. In the event that any payment owed by
any Person hereunder becomes due on a day that is not a Business Day, then such
payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day. If any Person fails
to pay any amount hereunder when due, such Person agrees to pay, on demand, the
Default Rate in respect thereof until paid in full; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such
Default Rate shall not at any time exceed the maximum rate permitted by
applicable law. All computations of interest payable hereunder shall be made on
the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days (including the
first but excluding the last day) elapsed.

     Section 1.6 License of Software.

          (a) To the extent that any software used by any Originator to account
for the Receivables originated by it is non-transferable, such Originator hereby
grants to each of Buyer, the Administrative Agent and the Servicer an
irrevocable, non-exclusive license to use, without royalty or payment of any
kind, all such software used by such Originator to account for such Receivables,
to the extent necessary to administer such Receivables, whether such software is
owned by such Originator or is owned by others and used by such Originator under
license agreements with respect thereto; PROVIDED THAT should the consent of any
licensor of such software be required for the grant of the license described
herein, to be effective, such Originator hereby agrees that upon the request of
Buyer (or Buyer's assignee), such Originator will use its reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent of such third-party licensor. If any software used by any
Originator to account for the Receivables originated by it prohibits such
Originator from granting the license to use described herein, or if, after
reasonable efforts, consent of any licensor of such software for the grant of
the license described herein is not obtained, there shall be no transfer of such
software hereunder or any grant by such Originator of the license to use
described herein. The license granted hereby shall be irrevocable until the
later to occur of (i) indefeasible payment in full of the Obligations (as
defined in the Credit and Security Agreement), and (ii) the

7

date each of this Agreement and the Credit and Security Agreement terminates in
accordance with its terms.

          (b) Each Originator (i) shall take such action requested by Buyer
and/or the Administrative Agent (as Buyer's assignee), from time to time
hereafter, that may be necessary or appropriate to ensure that Buyer and its
assigns have an enforceable ownership interest in the Records relating to the
Receivables distributed by purchased from such Originator hereunder, and (ii)
shall use its reasonable efforts to ensure that Buyer, the Administrative Agent
and the Servicer each has an enforceable right (whether by license or sublicense
or otherwise) to use all of the computer software used to account for such
Receivables and/or to recreate such Records.

     Section 1.7 Characterization. If, notwithstanding the intention of the
parties expressed in Section 1.2(c), any sale or contribution by an Originator
or Parent to Buyer of Receivables hereunder shall be characterized as a secured
loan and not a sale or contribution or such transfer shall for any reason be
ineffective or unenforceable, then this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute
a security agreement under the UCC and other applicable law. For this purpose
and without being in derogation of the parties' intention that each conveyance
of Receivables by an Originator or Parent hereunder shall constitute a true sale
or other absolute assignment thereof: (i) Parent hereby grants to Buyer a duly
perfected security interest in all of Parent's right, title and interest in and
to the Initial Contributed Assets and all proceeds thereof to secure the prompt
and complete payment of a loan deemed to have been made in an amount equal to
the credit to Buyer's paid-in capital and capital surplus booked at the time of
the issuance to Parent of Buyer's Equity Interests, together with all other
obligations of Parent to Buyer hereunder, which security interest shall be prior
to all other Adverse Claims (except as created under the Transaction Documents),
and (ii) such Originator hereby grants to Buyer a duly perfected security
interest in all of such Originator's right, title and interest in, to and under
all Receivables of such Originator which are now existing or hereafter arising,
all Collections and Related Security with respect thereto, each Lock-Box and
Collection Account, all other rights and payments relating to such Receivables
and all proceeds of the foregoing to secure the prompt and complete payment of a
loan deemed to have been made in an amount equal to the Purchase Price owing to
such Originator. Buyer and its assigns shall have, in addition to the rights and
remedies which they may have under this Agreement, all other rights and remedies
provided to a secured creditor under the UCC and other applicable law, which
rights and remedies shall be cumulative.

ARTICLE II
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     Section 2.1 Representations and Warranties. Parent hereby represents and
warrants to Buyer and its assigns on the date hereof, and each Originator hereby
represents and warrants to Parent, Buyer and Buyer's assigns, on the date hereof
and on each date that any Receivable is originated by such Originator on or
after the date hereof, that:

          (a) Existence and Power. Such Transferor is a corporation, duly
organized under the laws of the state set forth after its name in the preamble
to this Agreement (the "APPLICABLE STATE"), and no other state or jurisdiction,
and as to which such Applicable State must maintain a public record showing such
corporation to have been organized. Such Transferor is validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its Applicable State and is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing as a foreign entity, and has and holds all
power and all governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals
required to carry on its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is
conducted except where the failure to so qualify or so hold could not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (b) Power and Authority; Due Authorization, Execution and Delivery.
The execution and delivery by such Person of this Agreement and each other
Transaction Document to which it is a party, and the performance of its
obligations hereunder and thereunder, and, in the case of any Originator, such
Originator's use of the proceeds of the Purchase made from it hereunder, are
within its organizational powers and authority and have been duly authorized by
all necessary organizational action on its part. This Agreement and each other
Transaction Document to which such Transferor is a party has been duly executed
and delivered by such Transferor.

          (c) No Conflict. The execution and delivery by such Transferor of this
Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it is a party, and the
performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder do not result in the
creation or imposition of any Adverse Claim on assets of such Transferor, or
contravene or violate (i) its Organizational Documents, (ii) any law, rule or
regulation applicable to it, (iii) any restrictions under any agreement,
contract or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its
property is bound, or (iv) any order, writ, judgment, award, injunction or
decree binding on or affecting it or its property (except as created under the
Transaction Documents) except, in any case, where such contravention or
violation could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;
and no transaction contemplated hereby requires compliance with any bulk sales
act or similar law.

          (d) Governmental Authorization. Other than the filing of the financing
statements required hereunder, no authorization or approval or other action by,
and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body
is required for the due execution and delivery by such Transferor of this
Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it is a party and the
performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder.

9

(e) Actions, Suits. There are no actions, suits or proceedings
pending, or to the best of such Transferor's knowledge, threatened, against or
affecting such Transferor, or any of its properties, in or before any court,
arbitrator or other body, that could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

          (f) Binding Effect. Each of the Transaction Document to which such
Transferor is a party constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
such Transferor enforceable against such Transferor in accordance with its
respective terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws relating to or
limiting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

          (g) Accuracy of Information. All information heretofore furnished by
such Transferor or any of its Affiliates to Buyer (or its assigns) for purposes
of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the other Transaction Documents
or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby is, and all such information
hereafter furnished by such Transferor or any of its Affiliates to Buyer (or its
assigns) will be, true and accurate in every material respect on the date such
information is stated or certified and does not and will not contain any
material misstatement of fact or omit to state a material fact or any fact
necessary to make the statements contained therein, taken as a whole, not
misleading.

          (h) Use of Proceeds. No portion of any Purchase Price payment
hereunder will be used (i) for a purpose that violates, or would be inconsistent
with, any law, rule or regulation applicable to such Transferor or (ii) to
acquire any security in any transaction which is subject to Section 12, 13 or 14
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

          (i) Good Title. Immediately prior to the distribution of Initial
Contributed Assets by such Originator (if applicable) to Parent and the Purchase
from such Originator hereunder and upon the creation of each Receivable
originated by such Originator after the Initial Cut-Off Date, such Originator
(i) is the legal and beneficial owner of such Receivables and (ii) is the legal
and beneficial owner of the Related Security with respect thereto or possesses a
valid and perfected security interest therein, in each case, free and clear of
any Adverse Claim, except as created by the Transaction Documents. Immediately
prior to Parent's contribution of the Initial Contributed Assets to Buyer's
capital, Parent is the legal and beneficial owner of the Initial Contributed
Assets, free and clear of any Adverse Claim, except as created by the
Transaction Documents

          (j) Perfection. This Agreement, together with the filing of the
financing statements and assignments contemplated hereby, is effective to
transfer to Buyer (and Buyer shall acquire from such Transferor, directly or
indirectly): (i) legal and equitable title to, with the right to sell and
encumber each Receivable originated by such Originator, whether now existing and
hereafter arising, together with the Collections with respect thereto, and (ii)
all of such Originator's right, title and interest in the Related Security
associated with each such Receivable, in each case, free and clear of any
Adverse Claim, except as created by the

10

Transaction Documents. There have been duly filed all financing statements or
other similar instruments or documents necessary under the UCC (or any
comparable law) of all appropriate jurisdictions to perfect Buyer's ownership
interest in such Receivables, the Related Security and the Collections. Such
Transferor's jurisdiction of organization is a jurisdiction whose law generally
requires information concerning the existence of a nonpossessory security
interest to be made generally available in a filing, record or registration
system as a condition or result of such a security interest's obtaining priority
over the rights of a lien creditor which respect to collateral.

          (k) Places of Business and Locations of Records. The principal place
of business and chief executive office of such Transferor and the offices where
it keeps all of its Records are located at the address(es) listed on Exhibit II
or such other locations of which Buyer has been notified in accordance with
Section 4.2(a) in jurisdictions where all action required by Section 4.2(a) has
been taken and completed. Such Transferor's Federal Employer Identification
Number is correctly set forth on Exhibit II.

          (l) Collections. The conditions and requirements set forth in Section
4.1(j) have at all times been satisfied and duly performed. The names and
addresses of all Collection Banks, together with the account numbers of the
Collection Accounts of such Transferor at each Collection Bank and the post
office box number of each Lock-Box, are listed on Exhibit III. Such Originator
has not granted any Person, other than Buyer (and its assigns) dominion and
control of any Lock-Box or Collection Account, or the right to take dominion and
control of any such Lock-Box or Collection Account at a future time or upon the
occurrence of a future event.

          (m) Material Adverse Effect. Since June 30, 2005, no event has
occurred that would have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (n) Names. The name in which such Transferor has executed this
Agreement is identical to the name of such Transferor as indicated on the public
record of its state of organization which shows such Transferor to have been
organized. In the past five (5) years, such Transferor has not used any
corporate names, trade names or assumed names other than the name in which it
has executed this Agreement and as listed on Exhibit II.

          (o) Ownership of Buyer. Parent owns, directly or indirectly, 100% of
the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of each Originator and Buyer. Such
Equity Interests are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and there are
no options, warrants or other rights to acquire securities of Buyer or any
Originator.

          (p) Not a Holding Company or an Investment Company. Such Transferor is
not a "holding company" or a "subsidiary holding company" of a "holding company"
within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as
amended, or any successor statute. Such Transferor is not an "investment
company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,
or any successor statute.

11

(q) Compliance with Law. Such Transferor has complied in all respects
with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, orders, writs, judgments,
injunctions, decrees or awards to which it may be subject, except where the
failure to so comply could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Each Receivable, together with the Contract related thereto, does not
contravene any laws, rules or regulations applicable thereto (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, laws, rules and regulations relating to truth in lending, fair
credit billing, fair credit reporting, equal credit opportunity, fair debt
collection practices and privacy), and no part of such Contract is in violation
of any such law, rule or regulation, except where such contravention or
violation could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (r) Compliance with Credit and Collection Policy. Such Transferor has
complied in all material respects with the Credit and Collection Policy with
regard to each Receivable originated or contributed by it that was reflected in
any Purchase Report as an Eligible Receivable and was an Eligible Receivable on
the date of its acquisition by Buyer hereunder, and with regard to each Contract
with respect to such Receivable, and has not made any change to such Credit and
Collection Policy, except such material change as to which Buyer (and its
assigns) have been notified in accordance with Section 4.1(a)(vii).

          (s) Payments to such Originator. With respect to each Receivable
originated by such Originator and sold to Buyer hereunder, the Purchase Price
received by such Originator constitutes reasonably equivalent value in
consideration therefor. No transfer hereunder by such Originator of any
Receivable originated by such Originator is or may be voidable under any section
of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 (11 U.S.C. Sections 101 et seq.), as
amended.

          (t) Enforceability of Contracts. Each Contract with respect to each
Receivable that was reflected in any Purchase Report as an Eligible Receivable
and was an Eligible Receivable on the date of its acquisition by Buyer hereunder
is effective to create, and has created, a legal, valid and binding obligation
of the related Obligor to pay the Outstanding Balance of the Receivable created
thereunder and any accrued interest thereon, enforceable against the Obligor in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws relating
to or limiting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

          (u) Eligible Receivables. Each Receivable reflected in any Purchase
Report as an Eligible Receivable was an Eligible Receivable on the date of its
acquisition by Buyer hereunder.

          (v) Accounting. The manner in which such Originator accounts for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in its financial statements does not
jeopardize the characterization of the transactions contemplated herein as being
true sales.

12

ARTICLE III
                             CONDITIONS OF PURCHASE

     Section 3.1 Conditions Precedent to Purchase. The Purchase from each
Originator under this Agreement is subject to the conditions precedent that (a)
Buyer shall have been capitalized with the Initial Contributed Assets, (b) Buyer
shall have received on or before the closing date of the Credit and Security
Agreement those documents listed on Schedule A and (c) all of the conditions to
the initial purchase under the Credit and Security Agreement shall have been
satisfied on or before the closing date thereof or waived in accordance with the
terms thereof.

     Section 3.2 Conditions Precedent to Subsequent Payments. Buyer's obligation
to pay for Receivables coming into existence after the Initial Cutoff Date shall
be subject to the further conditions precedent that: (a) the Facility
Termination Date shall not have occurred under the Credit and Security
Agreement; (b) Buyer (or its assigns) shall have received such other approvals,
opinions or documents as it may reasonably request, and (c) on the date such
Receivable came into existence, the following statements shall be true (and
acceptance of the proceeds of any payment for such Receivable shall be deemed a
representation and warranty by such Originator that such statements are then
true):

               (i) the representations and warranties set forth in Article II
     are true and correct on and as of the date such Receivable came into
     existence as though made on and as of such date; and

               (ii) no event has occurred and is continuing that will constitute
     a Termination Event or an Unmatured Termination Event.

Notwithstanding the foregoing conditions precedent, upon payment of the Purchase
Price for any Receivable originated by any Originator (whether by payment of
cash or through an increase in the amounts outstanding under such Originator's
Subordinated Note), title to such Receivable and the Related Security and
Collections with respect thereto shall vest in Buyer, whether or not the
conditions precedent to Buyer's obligation to pay for such Receivable were in
fact satisfied. The failure of such Originator to satisfy any of the foregoing
conditions precedent, however, shall give rise to a right of Buyer to rescind
the related purchase and direct such Originator to pay to Buyer an amount equal
to the Purchase Price payment that shall have been made with respect to any
Receivables related thereto.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                                    COVENANTS

     Section 4.1 Affirmative Covenants of Transferors. Until the date on which

     statements required hereunder, a compliance certificate in substantially
     the form of Exhibit IV signed by a Financial Officer of Parent and dated

     Section 4043(b) of ERISA) with respect to any Plan has occurred (other than
     such a Reportable Event for which the PBGC has waived the 30-day notice

Transferor will comply in all respects with all applicable laws, rules,
regulations, orders, writs,

15

judgments, injunctions, decrees or awards to which it may be subject, except
where the failure to so comply could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Each Transferor will preserve and maintain its legal
existence, rights, franchises and privileges in the jurisdiction of its
organization, and qualify and remain qualified in good standing as a foreign
entity in each jurisdiction where its business is conducted, except where the
failure to so qualify or remain in good standing could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (d) Audits. Each Transferor will furnish to Buyer (or its assigns)
from time to time such information with respect to it and the Receivables sold
or contributed by it as Buyer (or its assigns) may reasonably request. Each
Transferor will, from time to time during regular business hours as requested by
Buyer (or its assigns), upon reasonable notice and at the sole cost of such
Transferor, permit Buyer (or its assigns) or their respective agents or
representatives, (i) to examine and make copies of and abstracts from all
Records in the possession or under the control of such Transferor relating to
the Receivables and the Related Security, including, without limitation, the
related Contracts, and (ii) to visit the offices and properties of such
Transferor for the purpose of examining such materials described in clause (i)
above, and to discuss matters relating to such Transferor's financial condition
or the Receivables and the Related Security or such Transferor's performance
under any of the Transaction Documents or such Transferor's performance under
the Contracts and, in each case, with any of the officers or employees of such
Transferor having knowledge of such matters (each of the foregoing examinations
and visits, a "REVIEW"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, so long as no Amortization
Event (under and as defined in the Credit and Security Agreement) has occurred
and is continuing: (A) the Transferors, collectively, shall only be responsible
for the reasonable costs and expenses of one (1) Review in any one calendar
year, and (B) the Administrative Agent (as Buyer's assignee) will not request
more than four (4) Reviews in any one calendar year.

          (e) Keeping and Marking of Records and Books.

               (i) Such Transferor will maintain and implement administrative
     and operating procedures (including, without limitation, an ability to
     recreate records evidencing Receivables in the event of the destruction of
     the originals thereof), and keep and maintain all documents, books, records
     and other information reasonably necessary or advisable for the collection
     of all Receivables (including, without limitation, records adequate to
     permit the immediate identification of each new Receivable and all
     Collections of and adjustments to each existing Receivable). Such
     Transferor will give Buyer (or its assigns) notice of any material change
     in the administrative and operating procedures referred to in the previous
     sentence.

               (ii) Such Transferor will (A) on or prior to the date hereof,
     mark its master data processing records and other books and records
     relating to the Receivables with a legend, acceptable to Buyer (or its

16

assigns), describing Buyer's ownership interests in the Receivables and
     further describing the interest of the Administrative Agent (on behalf of
     the Lenders) under the Credit and Security Agreement and (B) upon the
     request of Buyer (or its assigns): (x) mark each Contract with a legend
     describing Buyer's ownership interests in the Receivables originated by
     such Transferor and further describing the interest of the Administrative
     Agent (on behalf of the Lenders) and (y) after the occurrence of a
     Termination Event, deliver to Buyer (or its assigns) all Contracts
     (including, without limitation, all multiple originals of any such
     Contract) relating to such Receivables.

          (f) Compliance with Contracts and Credit and Collection Policy. Such
Transferor will timely and fully (i) perform and comply with all provisions,
covenants and other promises required to be observed by it under the Contracts
related to the Receivables originated by it, and (ii) comply in all respects
with the Credit and Collection Policy in regard to each such Receivable and the
related Contract.

          (g) Ownership. Such Transferor, as applicable, will take all necessary
action to establish and maintain, irrevocably in Buyer, (A) legal and equitable
title to the Receivables originated by such Transferor and the Collections and
(B) all of such Transferor's right, title and interest in the Related Security
associated with the Receivables originated by such Transferor, in each case,
free and clear of any Adverse Claims other than Adverse Claims in favor of Buyer
(and its assigns) (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, the filing of all financing
statements or other similar instruments or documents necessary under the UCC (or
any comparable law) of all appropriate jurisdictions to perfect Buyer's interest
in such Receivables, Related Security and Collections and such other action to
perfect, protect or more fully evidence the interest of Buyer as Buyer (or its
assigns) may reasonably request).

          (h) Lenders' Reliance. Such Transferor acknowledges that the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders are entering into the transactions
contemplated by the Credit and Security Agreement in reliance upon Buyer's
identity as a legal entity that is separate from such Transferor and any
Affiliates thereof. Therefore, from and after the date of execution and delivery
of this Agreement, such Transferor will take all reasonable steps including,
without limitation, all steps that Buyer or any assignee of Buyer may from time
to time reasonably request to maintain Buyer's identity as a separate legal
entity and to make it manifest to third parties that Buyer is an entity with
assets and liabilities distinct from those of such Transferor and any Affiliates
thereof and not just a division of such Transferor or any such Affiliate.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and in addition to the other
covenants set forth herein, such Transferor (i) will not hold itself out to
third parties as liable for the debts of Buyer nor purport to own any of the
Receivables and other assets acquired by Buyer, (ii) will take all other actions
necessary on its part to ensure that Buyer is at all times in compliance with
the "separateness covenants" set forth in Section 7.1(i) of the Credit and
Security Agreement and (iii) will cause all tax liabilities arising in
connection with the transactions contemplated herein or otherwise to be
allocated between such Transferor and Buyer on an arm's-length basis and in

17

a manner consistent with the procedures set forth in U.S. Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.1502-33(d) and 1.1552-1.

          (i) Collections. Such Transferor will cause (1) all proceeds from all
Lock-Boxes to be directly deposited by a Collection Bank into a Collection
Account and (2) each Lock-Box and Collection Account to be subject at all times
to a Collection Account Agreement that is in full force and effect. In the event
any payments relating to Receivables are remitted directly to such Transferor or
any Affiliate of such Transferor, such Transferor will remit (or will cause all
such payments to be remitted) directly to a Collection Bank and deposited into a
Collection Account within three (3) Business Days following receipt thereof and,
at all times prior to such remittance, such Transferor will itself hold or, if
applicable, will cause such payments to be held in trust for the exclusive
benefit of Buyer and its assigns. Such Transferor will transfer exclusive
ownership, dominion and control of each Lock-Box and Collection Account to Buyer
and, will not grant the right to take dominion and control of any Lock-Box or
Collection Account at a future time or upon the occurrence of a future event to
any Person, except to Buyer (or its assigns) as contemplated by this Agreement
and the Credit and Security Agreement.

          (j) Taxes. Such Transferor will file all tax returns and reports
required by law to be filed by it and promptly pay all taxes and governmental
charges at any time owing, except any such taxes which are not yet delinquent or
are being contested in good faith by appropriate and timely proceedings and for
which adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP shall have been set aside on its
books. Such Transferor will pay when due any and all present and future stamp,
documentary, and other similar taxes and governmental charges payable in
connection with the Receivables originated by it, and hold Buyer and its assigns
harmless from and against any and all liabilities with respect to or resulting
from any delay or omission to pay such taxes and governmental charges.

     Section 4.2 Negative Covenants of Transferors. Until the date on which this
Agreement terminates in accordance with its terms, each Transferor hereby
covenants that:

          (a) Name Change, Offices and Records. Such Transferor will not change
its (i) state of organization, (ii) name, (iii) identity or structure (within
the meaning of Article 9 of any applicable enactment of the UCC) or relocate its
chief executive office at any time while the location of its chief executive
office is relevant to perfection of Buyer's interest in the Receivables or the
associated Related Security and Collections or any office where Records are kept
unless it shall have: (i) given Buyer (and the Administrative Agent, as its
assignee) at least forty-five (45) days' prior written notice thereof and (ii)
delivered to the Administrative Agent (as Buyer's assignee) all financing
statements, instruments and other documents requested by the Administrative
Agent in connection with such change or relocation.

          (b) Change in Payment Instructions to Obligors. Such Transferor will
not add or terminate any bank as a Collection Bank, or make any change in the
instructions to Obligors regarding payments to be made to any Lock-Box or
Collection Account, unless Buyer

18

(or its assigns) shall have received, at least ten (10) days before the proposed
effective date therefor, (i) written notice of such addition, termination or
change and (ii) with respect to the addition of a Collection Bank or a
Collection Account or Lock-Box, an executed Collection Account Agreement with
respect to the new Collection Account or Lock-Box; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such
Transferor may make changes in instructions to Obligors regarding payments if
such new instructions require such Obligor to make payments to another existing
Collection Account.

          (c) Modifications to Contracts and Credit and Collection Policy. Such
Transferor will not make any change to the Credit and Collection Policy that
could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the collectibility of the
Receivables originated by it or decrease the credit quality of any of its newly
created Receivables. Except as otherwise permitted in its capacity as Servicer
pursuant to the Credit and Security Agreement, such Transferor will not extend,
amend or otherwise modify the terms of any Receivable or any Contract related
thereto other than in accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy.

          (d) Sales, Liens. Such Transferor will not sell, assign (by operation
of law or otherwise) or otherwise dispose of, or grant any option with respect
to, or create or suffer to exist any Adverse Claim upon (including, without
limitation, the filing of any financing statement) or with respect to, any
Receivable, Related Security or Collections, or upon or with respect to any
Contract under which any Receivable arises, or any Lock-Box or Collection
Account, or assign any right to receive income with respect thereto (other than,
in each case, the creation of the interests therein in favor of Buyer provided
for herein), and such Transferor will defend the right, title and interest of
Buyer in, to and under any of the foregoing property, against all claims of
third parties claiming through or under such Transferor.

          (e) Accounting for Purchase. Such Transferor will not, and will not
permit any Affiliate to, financially account (whether in financial statements or
otherwise) for the transactions contemplated hereby in any manner other than the
sale or other outright conveyance by such Transferor to Buyer of the Receivables
originated by such Transferor and the associated Related Security or in any
other respect account for or treat the transactions contemplated hereby in any
manner other than as a sale of such Receivables and Related Security by such
Transferor to Buyer except to the extent that such transactions are not
recognized on account of consolidated financial reporting in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles.

               (ix) any Termination Event described in Section 5.1(f);

               (x) any failure to vest and maintain vested in Buyer, or to
     transfer to Buyer, legal and equitable title to, and ownership of, the

     Security associated with such Receivables, in each case, free and clear of
     any Adverse Claim;

               (xi) the failure to have filed, or any delay in filing, financing
     statements or other similar instruments or documents under the UCC of any
     applicable jurisdiction or other applicable laws with respect to any
     Receivable originated by such Transferor, the Related Security and
     Collections with respect thereto, and the proceeds of any thereof, whether
     at the time of the Purchase from such Transferor hereunder or at any
     subsequent time;

               (xii) any action or omission by such Transferor which reduces or

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the foregoing indemnification is not intended
to, and shall not, constitute a guarantee of the collectibility or payment of
the Receivables conveyed hereunder; and (ii) nothing in the Section 6.1 shall
require a Transferor to indemnify any Indemnified Party for Receivables which
are not collected, not paid or otherwise uncollectible on account of the
insolvency, bankruptcy, creditworthiness or financial inability to pay of the
applicable Obligor.

24

25

request, to perfect, protect or more fully evidence the interest of Buyer
hereunder and the interest of the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the
Lenders) under the Credit and Security Agreement, or to enable Buyer (or its
assigns) to exercise and enforce their rights and remedies hereunder. At any
time, Buyer (or its assigns) may, at such Transferor's sole cost and expense,
direct such Transferor to notify the Obligors of Receivables of the ownership
interests of Buyer under this Agreement and may also direct that payments of all
amounts due or that become due under any or all Receivables be made directly to

expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by such Transferor as
provided in Section 6.2. Each Transferor irrevocably authorizes Buyer (and its
assigns) at any time and from time to time in the sole discretion of Buyer (or
its assigns), and appoints Buyer (and its assigns) as its attorney(ies)-in-fact,
to act on behalf of such Transferor (i) to execute on behalf of such Transferor
as debtor and to file financing statements necessary or desirable in Buyer's (or
its assigns') sole discretion to perfect and to maintain the perfection and
priority of the interest of Buyer in the Receivables originated by such
Transferor and the associated Related Security and Collections and (ii) to file
a carbon, photographic or other reproduction of this Agreement or any financing
statement with respect to the Receivables as a financing statement in such
offices as Buyer (or its assigns) in their sole discretion deem necessary or
desirable to perfect and to maintain the perfection and priority of Buyer's
interests in such Receivables. This appointment is coupled with an interest and
is irrevocable. From and after July 1, 2001, if any Transferor fails to perform
any of its obligations hereunder: (A) such Transferor hereby authorizes Buyer
(or its assigns) to file financing statements and other filing or recording
documents with respect to the Receivables and Related Security (including any
amendments thereto, or continuation or termination statements thereof), without
the signature or other authorization of such Transferor, in such form and in
such offices as Buyer (or any of its assigns) reasonably determines appropriate
to perfect or maintain the perfection of the ownership or security interests of
Buyer (or its assigns) hereunder, (B) such Transferor acknowledges and agrees
that it is not authorized to, and will not, file financing statements or other
filing or recording documents with respect to the Receivables or Related
Security (including any amendments thereto, or continuation or termination
statements thereof), without the express prior written approval by the
Administrative Agent (as Buyer's assignee), consenting to the form and substance
of such filing or recording document, and (C) such Transferor approves,
authorizes and ratifies any filings or recordings made by or on behalf of the
Administrative Agent (as Buyer's assign) in connection with the perfection of
the ownership or security interests in favor of Buyer or the Administrative
Agent (as Buyer's assign).

external accountants, attorneys and other advisors and as required by any
applicable law or order of any judicial or administrative proceeding.

          (b) Each Transferor hereby consents to the disclosure of any nonpublic

participant of any of the Persons described in clause (i), and (iii) to any

Administrative Agent may disclose any such nonpublic information pursuant to any
law, rule, regulation, direction, request or order of any judicial,
administrative or regulatory authority or proceedings (whether or not having the
force or effect of law).

     Section 7.5 Bankruptcy Petition.

          (a) Each Transferor and Buyer each hereby covenants and agrees that,
prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all

such other Person (or its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys
or agents) for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages in
respect of any claim for breach of contract or any other theory of liability
arising out of or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith; and each of the
parties hereto, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, attorneys, agents, successors and assigns, hereby waives, releases,
and agrees not to sue upon any claim for any such damages, whether or not
accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist in its favor.

Section 7.10 Integration; Binding Effect; Survival of Terms.

with respect to the subject matter hereof and shall constitute the entire
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
superseding all prior oral or written understandings.

          (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Transferors, Buyer and their respective successors and permitted assigns
(including any trustee in bankruptcy). No Transferor may assign any of its
rights and obligations hereunder or any interest herein without the prior
written consent of Buyer. Buyer may assign at any time its rights and
obligations hereunder and interests herein to any other Person without the
consent of any Transferor. Without limiting the foregoing, each Transferor
acknowledges that Buyer, pursuant to the Credit and Security Agreement, may
assign to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, its rights,
remedies, powers and privileges hereunder and that the Administrative Agent may
further assign such rights, remedies, powers and privileges to the extent
permitted in the Credit and Security Agreement. Each Transferor agrees that the
Administrative Agent, as the assignee of Buyer, shall, subject to the terms of
the Credit and Security Agreement, have the right to enforce this Agreement and
to exercise directly all of Buyer's rights and remedies under this Agreement
(including, without limitation, the right to give or withhold any consents or
approvals of Buyer to be given or withheld hereunder) and each Transferor agrees
to cooperate fully with the Administrative Agent in the exercise of such rights
and remedies. This Agreement shall create and constitute the continuing
obligations of the parties hereto in accordance with its terms and shall remain
in full force and effect until terminated in accordance with its terms;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the rights and remedies with respect to (i) any breach
of any representation and warranty made by any Transferor pursuant to Article
II; (ii) the indemnification and payment provisions of Article VI; and (iii)
Section 7.5 shall be continuing and shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.

     Section 7.11 Counterparts; Severability; Section References. This Agreement
may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
original and all of which when taken together shall constitute one and the same
Agreement. Any provisions of this Agreement which are prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction. Unless otherwise expressly indicated, all references herein
to "Article," "Section," "Schedule" or "Exhibit" shall mean articles and
sections of, and schedules and exhibits to, this Agreement.

29

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be

shall be

disregarded and a Participant's annual cash bonus payable from Rock-Tenn's or

2

(d) SERP III Benefit.

          (1) General Rule. If a Participant is designated as eligible for a
SERP III Benefit, his or her SERP Benefit shall equal [(A - B) x (C)] - D, where

          A is a life only annuity payable as of the Participant's Normal
Retirement Date where the annual benefit equals 3.5833% of his or her Final
Average Compensation multiplied by the number of his or her years of Benefit
Service (up to a maximum of 15 years of Benefit Service), and

          B is a life only annuity payable as of the Participant's Normal
Retirement Date where the annual benefit equals the sum of (1) his or her Social
Security Benefit (expressed as an annual benefit) and (2) the benefits actually
payable to, or on behalf of, the Participant under the Pension Plan (expressed
as an annual benefit),

          C equals the appropriate early retirement factors and lump sum
conversion factors described in Section 3.3(b) (to convert (A - B) into a lump
sum benefit payable under Section 3.3) and

          D equals the amount of the benefits payable to, or on behalf of, the
Participant from his or her matching account under the 401(k) Plan and the

Service for purposes of determining his or her benefit on the Change in Control
Date.

          (e) Offsets. A benefit shall be treated as payable to, or on behalf
of, a Participant under Section 3.1(b)(1)(B), Section 3.1(c)(1)(B) and Section
3.1(d)(1)(B) if such benefit is payable to any person other than the Participant
for any reason whatsoever and, if a Participant's benefit is payable to any
other person as a result of a domestic relations order, the offsets called for
under such sections of this Section 3.1 shall be effected on an Actuarial
Equivalent basis.

Section 9.

          By adding a new Section 3.1(f), SERP IV Benefit, to read as follows:

          (f) SERP IV Benefit. Each Participant designated on Exhibit A attached
hereto shall be eligible to accrue a benefit under this Plan as of December 31,
2005, December 31, 2006, December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2008 equal to the
product of (a) times (b) where

          (a) equals the lesser of (1) 2% or (2) the "Consumer Price Index
Adjustment" immediately preceding each December 31 and

          (b) equals the sum of the amounts in column 1 and column 2 set forth
opposite each Participant's name on Exhibit A,

provided, however, he or she shall accrue a benefit as of a December 31 only if
he or she is employed by Rock-Tenn Company on such December 31.

For purposes of this paragraph, "Consumer Price Index Adjustment" means the
increase or decrease (expressed as a percentage) over the 12 month period ending
on September 30, 2005 or, when applicable, over the 12 month period ending on
the last day of each September thereafter in the U. S. Department of Labor's
Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for the U.S. City Average for All
Items, 1982-84=100, as such index is reported without any seasonal adjustment.

                                   Section 10.

          By amending Section 3.2, Vested Benefit, to read as follows:

     3.2 Vested Benefit. If a Participant is not fully vested in his or her
accrued benefit under the Pension Plan (based on the actual number of years of
vesting service he or she has completed under the Pension Plan) on his or her
Employment Termination Date, he or she shall forfeit his or her benefit under
this SERP, provided, however, a Participant's SERP IV Benefit shall be
nonfeitable to the extent accrued under Section 3.1(f).

                                   Section 11.

          By amending Section 3.3, Payment, to read as follows:

     3.3 Payment.

          (a) Employment Termination Prior to November 11, 2005. The SERP
Benefit I or II payable to, or on behalf of, a Participant under this Section 3
who had an Employment Termination Date prior to November 11, 2005 shall
(consistent with

4

the payment limitations under Section 409A of the Code) be paid as of the same
date, in the same benefit payment form and to the same person as the
Participant's benefit under the Pension Plan, all as determined without taking
into account any part of the Participant's benefit which is payable to any
person pursuant to any qualified domestic relations order.

          (b) Employment Termination On or After November 11, 2005. The SERP I,
II or IV Benefit payable to, or on behalf of a Participant under this Section 3
who has an Employment Termination Date on or after November 11, 2005 shall
(consistent with the payment limitations under Section 409A of the Code) be paid
as soon as practicable after his or her Employment Termination Date in a lump
sum which is the present value of the benefit (using the applicable "conversion
factors" and "early reduction factors" as set forth in paragraphs (i), (ii) and
(iii) below) payable to the Participant under this Plan, all as determined
without taking into account any part of the Participant's benefit which is
payable to any person pursuant to any qualified domestic relations order. The
appropriate conversion and early reduction factors shall be (1) determined by
the Plan's Actuary, (2) based on the Actuarial Equivalent factors set forth in
Section 2.1(b) as in effect on the Participant's Employment Termination Date and
(3) supplied by the Plan's Actuary as soon as practicable following the
Participant's Employment Termination Date.

               (i) In the event a Participant's Employment Termination Date is
     on or after his or her Normal Retirement Date, his or her SERP Benefit
     shall be converted to a lump sum present value benefit using the "immediate
     lump sum factor".

               (ii) In the event a Participant's Employment Termination Date is
     on or after his or her Early Retirement Date and before his or her Normal
     Retirement Date, his or her SERP Benefit shall be the greater of (A) the
     SERP Benefit (as first reduced by the applicable "early retirement
     reduction factors" used by the Actuary under the Pension Plan) converted to
     a lump sum present value benefit using the "immediate lump sum factor" or
     (B) the SERP Benefit converted to a lump sum present value benefit using
     the "deferred lump sum factor."

               (iii) In the event a Participant's Employment Termination Date is
     before he or she reaches either his or her Normal Retirement Date or his or
     her Early Retirement Date, his or her SERP Benefit shall be converted to a
     lump sum present value using the "deferred lump sum factor. "

          (c) SERP III Benefit. The SERP III Benefit payable to, or on behalf of
a Participant under this Section 3 who has an Employment Termination Date on or
after November 11, 2005 shall (consistent with the payment limitations under
Section 409A of the Code) be paid as soon as practicable after his or her
Employment Termination Date in a lump sum as determined under Section 3.1(d).

5

(d) Specified Employee. If the Participant is a "specified employee"
within the meaning of Code Section 409A, any benefit payable as an annuity shall
start, and any benefit payable as a lump sum shall be paid, to the Participant
no earlier than 6 months after the Participant's Employment Termination Date and
such benefit will be credited with interest (as determined under Section
2.1(b)(2)) until the date the benefit is paid to the Participant. If such
Participant dies and an annuity or lump sum is payable to his or her
beneficiary, such annuity shall start or such lump sum shall be paid to his or
her beneficiary as soon as practicable following his or her death and such
benefit will be credited with interest (as determined under Section 2.1(b)(2))
until the date the benefit is paid to the Participant's beneficiary.

          The amendment made in this Section 11 is intended to comply with the
guidance provided to date by the U. S. Treasury regarding Section 409A of the
Code.

                                   Section 12.

          Except as hereinabove amended and modified, the Plan as amended and
restated effective as of January 1, 2003, and as amended by Amendment Number One
shall remain in full force and effect. However, this Plan shall be administered
by the Committee in good faith to comply with the requirements of Section 409A
of the Code pending the amendment of this Plan to comply with such requirements.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, based on a resolution adopted by the Committee,
Rock-Tenn Company has caused this Amendment Number Two to be executed by its
duly authorized officer this 2nd day of February, 2006.

          B. Goal. The Controlling Company desires (i) to provide its designated
key management employees (and those of its affiliated companies that participate
in the Plan) with an opportunity to defer the receipt and income taxation of a
portion of such employees' annual base salary and other designated payments, and
(ii) to provide certain of such employees with additional deferred compensation
as the Controlling Company and/or certain other participating companies may
determine.

          C. Purpose. The purpose of the Plan document is to set forth the terms
and conditions pursuant to which these deferrals and contributions may be made
and to describe the nature and extent of the employees' rights to such amounts.

          D. Type of Plan. The Plan constitutes an unfunded, nonqualified
deferred compensation plan that benefits certain designated employees who are
within a select group of key management or highly compensated employees. Except
with regard to amounts that were earned and vested prior to January 1, 2005, it
is intended that this Plan comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the
Internal Revenue Code 1986, as amended.

                             STATEMENT OF AGREEMENT

          To amend and restate the Plan with the purposes and goals as

ARTICLE II
                          ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION

     2.1 Eligibility.

          Except as otherwise provided on an exhibit to the Plan, each
individual who is an Eligible Employee as of the first day of a Plan Year will
be eligible to participate in the Plan for the entire Plan Year. Such
individual's participation will become effective as of the first day of such
Plan Year (assuming he satisfies the procedures for admission described below).

     2.2 Procedure for Admission.

          Each Eligible Employee will become a Participant by completing such
forms and providing such data in a timely manner, as are required by the
Administrative Committee as a precondition of participation in the Plan. Such
forms and data may include, without limitation, a Deferral Election, the
Eligible Employee's acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Plan, and the
designation of a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries to receive any death benefits
payable hereunder.

     2.3 Cessation of Eligibility.

          (a) Cessation of Eligible Status. An employee will cease active
participation in the Plan if, as of any day during a Plan Year, he separates
from service with all members of the Controlled Group, in which case his
deferrals under the Plan will cease.

          (b) Inactive Participant Status. Even if his active participation in
the Plan ends, an employee will remain an inactive Participant in the Plan until
the earlier of (i) the date the full amount of his vested Account (if any) is
distributed from the Plan, or (ii) the date he again becomes an Eligible
Employee and recommences active participation in the Plan. During the period of
time that an employee is an inactive Participant in the Plan, his Account will
continue to be credited with earnings and/or losses as provided for in Section
3.5.

5

ARTICLE III
                 PARTICIPANTS' ACCOUNTS; DEFERRALS AND CREDITING

     3.1 Participants' Accounts.

          (a) Establishment of Accounts. The Administrative Committee will
establish and maintain an Account on behalf of each Participant. To the extent
provided herein, each Account will be credited with (i) Deferral Contributions,
and (ii) earnings attributable to such Deferral Contributions, and will be
debited by (A) losses attributable to such Deferral Contributions, and (B) the
amount of all distributions. Each Account of a Participant will be maintained
until the vested value thereof has been distributed to or on behalf of such
Participant or his Beneficiary or Beneficiaries.

          (b) Nature of Contributions and Accounts. The amounts credited to a
Participant's Account will be represented solely by bookkeeping entries. Except
as provided in Article VII, no monies or other assets will actually be set aside
for such Participant, and all payments to a Participant or Beneficiary under the
Plan will be made from the general assets of the Participating Companies.

          (c) Several Liabilities. Each Participating Company will be severally
(and not jointly) liable for the payment of benefits under the Plan in an amount
equal to all undistributed Deferral Contributions withheld from Participant's
Compensation paid or payable by each such Participating Company, as adjusted for
earnings and/or losses pursuant to Section 3.5. The Administrative Committee
will allocate the total liability to pay benefits under the Plan among the
Participating Companies pursuant to this formula, and the Administrative
Committee's determination will be final and binding.

          (d) General Creditors. Any assets which may be acquired by a
Participating Company in anticipation of its obligations under the Plan will be
part of the general assets of such Participating Company. A Participating
Company's obligation to pay benefits under the Plan constitutes a mere promise
of such Participating Company to pay such benefits, and a Participant or
Beneficiary will have and maintain no more rights than those of an unsecured,
general creditor of such Participating Company.

     3.2 Deferral Contributions.

          Except as provided on a exhibit to the Plan, each Eligible Employee
who is or becomes eligible to participate in the Plan for a Plan Year may elect
to have Deferral Contributions made on his behalf for such Plan Year by
completing and delivering to the Administrative Committee (or its designee) a
Deferral Election setting forth the terms of his election. Subject to the terms
and conditions set forth below, a Deferral Election will provide for the
reduction of an Eligible Employee's Compensation in each regular paycheck
payable during the Plan Year for which the Deferral Election is in effect.

6

3.3 Procedure for Elections. Except as otherwise provided on an exhibit to
the Plan and subject to any modifications, additions or exceptions that the
Administrative Committee, in its sole discretion, deems necessary, appropriate
or helpful, the following terms will apply to Deferral Elections:

          (a) Effective Date. A Participant's Deferral Election with respect to
his Compensation for any Plan Year will be effective for the first regular
paycheck that (i) is paid after the date the Deferral Election is submitted and
becomes effective and (ii) relates to a payroll period ending no earlier than
the last day of the immediately preceding Plan Year. To be effective, a
Participant's Deferral Election must be made before the first day of the Plan
Year for which Deferral Contributions will be made or at such earlier time as
the Administrative Committee may prescribe. If an Eligible Employee fails to
submit a Deferral Election in a timely manner, he will be deemed to have elected
not to participate in the Plan for that Plan Year.

          (b) Term. A Participant's Deferral Election will remain in effect only
for the Plan Year for which it is effective and will terminate on the earliest
of (i) the date the Participant ceases to be an active Participant, (ii) the
date the Participant's Deferral Election is revoked (as provided in subsection
(d) hereof), or (iii) the date on which is made the last payment of Compensation
relating to a payroll period ending prior to the last day of the Plan Year for
which the Deferral Election is effective. If a Participant is transferred from
the employment of one Participating Company to the employment of another
Participating Company, his Deferral Election with the first Participating
Company will remain in effect and will apply to his Compensation from the second
Participating Company until the earlier of those events set forth in the
preceding sentence.

          (c) Amount. A Participant may elect to defer his Compensation payable
in each regular paycheck in 1 percent increments, up to a maximum of 75 percent
of his Compensation; provided, no Participant shall be permitted to defer more
than $9,300 of his Compensation in any Plan Year; and, provided, further, the
Administrative Committee may establish other maximum percentages and or amounts
from time to time.

          (d) Revocation.

               (i) Automatic Revocation. If (i) a Participant receives a
     hardship distribution from any Code Section 401(k) plan maintain by a
     member of the Controlled Group, and (ii) the terms of such Code Section
     401(k) plan provide for the suspension of elective contributions, such
     Participant's Deferral Election shall automatically be revoked and such
     Participant shall be prohibited from making Deferral Contributions for the
     period during which elective contributions are suspended under the terms of
     such Code Section 401(k) plan. A Participant whose Deferral Election is
     revoked may enter into a new Deferral Election with respect to his
     Compensation for any subsequent Plan Year by making such Deferral Election
     in accordance this Section and Section 3.2; provided, such Deferral
     Election shall become effective no earlier than the end of the suspension
     period provided under the terms of the applicable Code Section 401(k) plan.

7

(ii) Voluntary Revocation. A Participant who has suffered a
     Financial Hardship during a Plan Year may revoke his Deferral Election for
     such Plan Year by delivering an application for revocation to the
     Administrative Committee, and such revocation will be effective as soon as
     practicable after the date of the Administrative Committee's decision, made
     in its sole discretion, that the Participant has suffered a Financial
     Hardship. A Participant who revokes his Deferral Election may enter into a
     new Deferral Election with respect to his Compensation for any subsequent
     Plan Year by making such Deferral Election in accordance this Section and
     Section 3.2.

          (e) Crediting of Deferred Compensation. For each Plan Year that a
Participant has a Deferral Election in effect, the Administrative Committee will
credit the amount of such Participant's Deferral Contributions to his Account
on, or as soon as practicable after, the Valuation Date on which such amount
would have been paid to him but for his election hereunder.

     3.4 Debiting of Distributions.

          As of each Valuation Date, the Administrative Committee will debit
each Participant's Account for any amount distributed from such Account since
the immediately preceding Valuation Date.

     3.5 Crediting of Earnings.

          As of each Valuation Date, the Administrative Committee will credit to
each Participant's Account the amount of earnings and/or losses applicable
thereto for the period since the immediately preceding Valuation Date, based on
the amount of the Participant's Account that was deemed invested in each
Investment Fund.

     3.6 Vesting.

          A Participant will at all times be fully vested in his Deferral
Contributions, as adjusted for earnings and/or losses pursuant to Section 3.5.

     3.7 Notice to Participants of Account Balances.

          At least once for each Plan Year, the Administrative Committee will
cause a written statement of a Participant's Account balance to be distributed
to the Participant.

     3.8 Good Faith Valuation Binding.

          In determining the value of the Accounts, the Administrative Committee
will exercise its best judgment, and all such determinations of value (in the
absence of bad faith) will be binding upon all Participants and their
Beneficiaries.

8

3.9 Errors and Omissions in Accounts.

          If an error or omission is discovered in the Account of a Participant
or in the amount of a Participant's deferrals, the Administrative Committee, in
its sole discretion, will cause appropriate, equitable adjustments to be made as
soon as administratively practicable following the discovery of such error or
omission.

9

ARTICLE IV
                                INVESTMENT FUNDS

     4.1 Selection by Administrative Committee.

          From time to time, the Administrative Committee will select two or
more Investment Funds for purposes of determining the rate of return on amounts
deemed invested in accordance with the terms of the Plan. The Administrative
Committee may change, add or remove Investment Funds on a prospective basis at
any time(s) and in any manner it deems appropriate.

     4.2 Participant Direction of Deemed Investments.

          Each Participant generally may direct the manner in which his Account
will be deemed invested in and among the Investment Funds; provided, such
investment directions will be made in accordance with the following terms:

          (a) Nature of Participant Direction. The selection of Investment Funds
by a Participant will be for the sole purpose of determining the rate of return
to be credited to his Account, and will not be treated or interpreted in any
manner whatsoever as a requirement or direction to actually invest assets in any
Investment Fund or any other investment media. The Plan, as an unfunded,
nonqualified deferred compensation plan, at no time will have any actual
investment of assets relative to the benefits or Accounts hereunder.

          (b) Participant Elections. Each Participant may make an Investment
Election prescribing the percentage of his Account and/or future contributions
that will be deemed invested in each Investment Fund and may modify such
Investment Elections with respect to his existing Account and/or future
contributions as of any Valuation Date; provided, any such modification will be
effective after the Administrative Committee (or its designee) has a reasonable
opportunity to process such modification pursuant to such procedures as the
Administrative Committee may determine from time to time.

          (c) Administrative Committee Discretion. The Administrative Committee
will have complete discretion to adopt and revise procedures to be followed in
making such Investment Elections. Such procedures may include, but are not
limited to, the process of making elections, the permitted frequency of making
elections, the incremental size of elections, the deadline for making elections,
the effective date of such elections and whether and the extent to which to
charge any Participant's Account an administrative fee for making such
Investment Elections. Any procedures adopted by the Administrative Committee
that are inconsistent with the deadlines or procedures specified in this Section
will supersede such provisions of this Section without the necessity of a Plan
amendment.

10

ARTICLE V
                           PAYMENT OF ACCOUNT BALANCES

     5.1 Benefit Payments Upon Termination of Service for Reasons Other Than
Death.

          (a) General Rule Concerning Benefit Payments. In accordance with the
terms of subsection (b) hereof, if a Participant separates from service with the
Controlling Company, all other members of the Controlled Group and all members
of the RTS Controlled Group for any reason other than death, he (or his
Beneficiary or Beneficiaries, if he dies after such termination of employment
but before distribution of his Account) will be entitled to receive or begin
receiving a distribution of the total of: (i) the entire vested amount credited
to his Account, determined as of the Valuation Date on which such distribution
is processed; plus (ii) the vested amount of Deferral Contributions made since
such Valuation Date. For purposes of this subsection (a), the "Valuation Date on
which such distribution is processed" refers to the Valuation Date established
for such purpose by administrative practice, even if actual payment is made or
commenced at a later date due to delays in valuation, administration or any
other procedure. For all purposes under the Plan, the term "separation from
service" shall have the meaning determined under Code Section 409A and shall
include a Participating Company ceasing to be a member of the Controlled Group
to the extent permitted under Code Section 409A.

          (b) Timing of Distribution.

               (i) General Rule. Except as provided in subsection (b)(ii) or
     (b)(iii) hereof, the distribution of the vested benefit payable to a
     Participant under this Section will be made or commenced as soon as
     administratively feasible after the date the Participant separates from
     service with the Controlling Company, all other members of the Controlled
     Group and all members of the RTS Controlled Group for any reason other than
     death.

               (ii) Distributions to Key Employees. Notwithstanding subsection
     (b)(i) hereof, the distribution of the vested benefit payable under this
     Section to a Participant who is a Key Employee will be made or commenced as
     soon as administratively feasible after the earlier of (i) the 6-month
     anniversary of the date the Participant separates from service with the
     Controlling Company, all other members of the Controlled Group and all
     members of the RTS Controlled Group for any reason other than death, or
     (ii) the date of the Participant's death.

               (iii) Distributions Following Change to Form of Distribution.
     Notwithstanding subsection (b)(i) hereof, the distribution of the vested
     benefit payable under this Section to a Participant who has changed his
     initially elected form of distribution pursuant to Section 5.2(c) hereof
     will be made or commenced as soon as administratively feasible after the
     5-year anniversary of the date the Participant separates from service with
     the Controlling Company, all other members of the Controlled Group and all
     members of the RTS Controlled Group for any reason other than death.

11

5.2 Form of Distribution.

          (a) Single-Sum Payment. Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof,
the benefit payable to a Participant under Section 5.1 will be distributed in
the form of a single-sum payment in cash.

          (b) Quarterly Installments. A Participant may elect, at the time he
makes his initial Deferral Election, to have the benefit payable to him under
Section 5.1 paid in the form of quarterly installment payments in cash. The
following terms and conditions will apply to quarterly installment payments made
under the Plan:

               (i) The quarterly installment payments will be made in
     substantially equal installments over a period of not less than 3 years and
     not more than 10 years (adjusted for earnings and/or losses between
     payments in the manner described in Section 3.5). The initial value of the
     obligation for the quarterly installment payments will be equal to the
     amount of the Participant's Account balance calculated in accordance with
     the terms of Section 5.1(a).

               (ii) If the amount of the first such quarterly installment
     payment is less than $100, the benefit payable to the Participant under
     Section 5.1 will be distributed in the form of a single-sum payment in cash
     without regard to the Participant's election of quarterly installment
     payments.

               (iii) If a Participant dies after payment of his benefit from the
     Plan has begun but before his entire benefit has been distributed, the
     remaining amount of his Account balance will be distributed to the
     Participant's designated Beneficiary or Beneficiaries in the form of a
     single-sum payment in cash.

          (c) Changing Form of Distribution. After the time a Participant makes
his initial Deferral Election, he may make one (and no more than one) change to
the form in which the benefit payable to him under Section 5.1 will be
distributed to another form otherwise available under subsection (a) or (b)
hereof; provided, such change will not be effective if the Participant separates
from service with all members of the Controlled Group and all members of the RTS
Controlled Group within 12 months of the date his change is made; and, provided
further, the date on which his distribution will be made or commenced will be
delayed in accordance with Section 5.1(b)(iii).

     5.3 Death Benefits.

          If a Participant dies before payment of his benefit from the Plan is
made or commenced, the Beneficiary or Beneficiaries designated by such
Participant in his latest beneficiary designation form filed with the
Administrative Committee will be entitled to receive a distribution of the total
of (i) the entire vested amount credited to such Participant's Account,
determined as of the Valuation Date on which such distribution is processed;
plus (ii) the vested amount of any Deferral Contributions made since such
Valuation Date. For purposes of this

12

Section, the "Valuation Date on which such distribution is processed" refers to
the Valuation Date established for such purpose by administrative practice, even
if actual payment is made or commenced at a later date due to delays in
valuation, administration or any other procedure. The benefit will be
distributed to such Beneficiary or Beneficiaries as soon as administratively
feasible after the date of the Participant's death (without regard to whether
the Participant was a Key Employee) in the form of a single-sum payment in cash.

     5.4 Hardship Distributions.

          Upon receipt of an application for an in-service hardship distribution
and the Administrative Committee's decision, made in its sole discretion, that a
Participant has suffered a Financial Hardship, such Participant will be entitled
to receive an in-service distribution. Such distribution will be paid in a
single-sum payment in cash as soon as administratively feasible after the
Administrative Committee determines that the Participant has incurred a
Financial Hardship. The amount of such single-sum payment will be limited to the
amount of the Participant's vested Account that the Administrative Committee
determines is reasonably necessary to meet the Participant's requirements
resulting from the Financial Hardship. The amount of such distribution will
reduce the Participant's Account balance as provided in Section 3.4.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, all hardship
distributions shall be subject to the requirements applicable to distributions
on account of unforeseeable emergency under Code Section 409A.

     5.5 Beneficiary Designation.

          (a) General. Participants will designate and from time to time may
redesignate their Beneficiaries in such form and manner as the Administrative
Committee may determine.

          (b) No Designation or Designee Dead or Missing. In the event that:

               (i) a Participant dies without designating a Beneficiary;

               (ii) the Beneficiary designated by a Participant is not surviving
     when a payment is to be made to such person under the Plan, and no
     contingent Beneficiary has been designated; or

               (iii) the Beneficiary designated by a Participant cannot be
     located by the Administrative Committee within 1 year from the date
     benefits are to be paid to such person;

then, in any of such events, the Beneficiary of such Participant with respect to
any benefits that remain payable under the Plan will be the Participant's
Surviving Spouse, if any, and if not, the estate of the Participant.

13

5.6 Taxes.

          If the whole or any part of any Participant's or Beneficiary's benefit
hereunder becomes subject to any estate, inheritance, income, employment or
other tax which a Participating Company is required to pay or withhold, the
Participating Company will have the full power and authority to withhold and pay
such tax out of any monies or other property in its hand for the account of the
Participant or Beneficiary whose interests hereunder are so affected (including,
without limitation, by reducing and offsetting the Participant's or
Beneficiary's Account balance). Prior to making any payment, the Participating
Company may require such releases or other documents from any lawful taxing
authority as it deems necessary.

     5.7 Offset of Benefit by Amounts Owed to the Controlling Company.

          Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the
Administrative Committee may, in its sole discretion, offset any payment or
payments of benefit to a Participant under the Plan by any amount owed by such
Participant to the Controlling Company or any member of the Controlled Group.

14

ARTICLE VI
                                     CLAIMS

     6.1 Rights.

          All Plan benefit will be paid in accordance with Article V, but, if a
Participant or Beneficiary has any grievance, complaint or claim concerning any
aspect of the operation or administration of the Plan, including but not limited
to claims for benefits (collectively referred to herein as "claim" or "claims"),
the Participant or Beneficiary shall submit the claim in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Article VI. All such claims must be submitted
within the "applicable limitations period." The "applicable limitations period"
shall be 2 years, beginning on (i) in the case of any single-sum payment, the
date on which the payment was made, (ii) in the case of a periodic payment, the
date of the first in the series of payments, or (iii) for all other claims, the
date on which the action complained of occurred. Additionally, upon denial of an
appeal pursuant to Section 6.3, a Participant or Beneficiary shall have 90 days
within which to bring suit against the Plan for any claim related to such denied
appeal; any such suit initiated after such 90-day period shall be precluded.

     6.2 Initial Claim.

          Claims for benefits under the Plan may be filed with the
Administrative Committee on forms or in such other written documents, as the
Administrative Committee may prescribe. The Administrative Committee will
furnish to the claimant written notice of the disposition of a claim within 90
days after the application therefor is filed; provided, if special circumstances
require an extension of time for processing the claim, the Administrative
Committee will furnish written notice of the extension to the claimant prior to
the end of the initial 90-day period, and such extension will not exceed one
additional, consecutive 90-day period. In the event the claim is denied, the
notice of the disposition of the claim will provide the specific reasons for the
denial, citations of the pertinent provisions of the Plan, and, where
appropriate, an explanation as to how the claimant can perfect the claim and/or
submit the claim for review.

     6.3 Appeal.

          Any Participant or Beneficiary who has been denied a benefit will be
entitled, upon request to the Administrative Committee, to appeal the denial of
his claim. The claimant (or his duly authorized representative) may review
pertinent documents related to the Plan in the Administrative Committee's
possession in order to prepare the appeal. The request for review, together with
a written statement of the claimant's position, must be filed with the
Administrative Committee no later than 60 days after receipt of the written
notification of denial of a claim provided for in Section 6.2. The
Administrative Committee's decision will be made within 60 days following the
filing of the request for review and will be communicated in writing to the
claimant; provided, if special circumstances require an extension of time for
processing the appeal, the Administrative Committee will furnish written notice
to the claimant prior to the end of the initial 60-day period, and such an
extension will not exceed one additional 60-day period.

15

If unfavorable, the notice of the decision will explain the reasons for denial
and indicate the provisions of the Plan or other documents used to arrive at the
decision.

     6.4 Satisfaction of Claims.

          Any payment to a Participant or Beneficiary will to the extent thereof
be in full satisfaction of all claims hereunder against the Administrative
Committee and the Participating Companies, any of whom may require such
Participant or Beneficiary, as a condition to such payment, to execute a receipt
and release therefor in such form as determined by the Administrative Committee
or the Participating Companies. If receipt and release is required but the
Participant or Beneficiary (as applicable) does not provide such receipt and
release in a timely enough manner to permit a timely distribution in accordance
with the general timing of distribution provisions in the Plan, the payment of
any affected distribution may be delayed until the Administrative Committee or
the Participating Companies receive a proper receipt and release.

16

ARTICLE VII
                             SOURCE OF FUNDS; TRUST

     7.1 Source of Funds.

          Except as provided in this Section and Section 7.2 (relating to the
Trust), each Participating Company will provide the benefits described in the
Plan from its general assets. However, to the extent that funds in such Trust
allocable to the benefits payable under the Plan are sufficient, the Trust
assets may be used to pay benefits under the Plan. If such Trust assets are not
sufficient to pay all benefits due under the Plan, then the appropriate
Participating Company will have the obligation, and the Participant or
Beneficiary, who is due such benefits, will look to such Participating Company
to provide such benefits.

     7.2 Trust.

          (a) Establishment. To the extent determined by the Controlling
Company, the Participating Companies will transfer to the Trustee the funds
necessary to fund benefits accrued hereunder to be held and administered by the
Trustee pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement. Except as otherwise
provided in the Trust Agreement, each transfer into the Trust Fund will be
irrevocable as long as a Participating Company has any liability or obligations
under the Plan to pay benefits, such that the Trust property is in no way
subject to use by the Participating Company; provided, it is the intent of the
Controlling Company that the assets held by the Trust are and will remain at all
times subject to the claims of the general creditors of the Participating
Companies.

          (b) Distributions. Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Trustee will
make payments to Plan Participants and Beneficiaries in accordance with a
payment schedule provided by a Participating Company. The Participating Company
will make provisions for the reporting and withholding of any federal, state or
local taxes that may be required to be withheld with respect to the payment of
benefits pursuant to the terms of the Plan and will pay amounts withheld to the
appropriate taxing authorities or determine that such amounts have been
reported, withheld and paid by the Participating Company.

          (c) Status of the Trust. No Participant or Beneficiary will have any
interest in the assets held by the Trust or in the general assets of the
Participating Companies other than as a general, unsecured creditor.
Accordingly, a Participating Company will not grant a security interest in the
assets held by the Trust in favor of the Participants, Beneficiaries or any
creditor.

     7.3 Controlling Company Guaranty.

          (a) Obligation Parameters. During any period in which any
Participating Company is insolvent or in bankruptcy or for any reason whatsoever
does not have sufficient, available, liquid assets to fully satisfy its
obligations under the Plan due and payable by such Participating Company (a
"Nonpayment Period"), the Controlling Company, in the capacity of guarantor,
will have the unconditional obligation to pay all of such Participating
Company's Plan

17

benefit obligations to the Participants of such Participating Company. During
any Nonpayment Period with respect to a Participating Company, a Participant of
such Participating Company shall not be obligated or required before enforcing
this Section against the Controlling Company (i) to pursue any right or remedy
he may have against such Participating Company or to commence any suit or other
proceeding against such Participating Company in any court or other tribunal;
(ii) to make any claim in a liquidation or bankruptcy of such Participating
Company; or (iii) to wait more than 30 days after making an initial demand of
such Participating Company under the normal claims procedures set forth under
the Plan.

          (b) Limit on Controlling Company's Obligation. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, in the event that the Controlling Company or
any of its affiliates ceases to own, directly or indirectly, in the aggregate,
all of the ownership interest in a Participating Company, all obligations under
the Plan applicable to such Participating Company shall be fixed as of the date
of such cessation, and any such obligations of such Participating Company
accruing after such date shall be expressly excluded from this Section.

          (c) Nature of Obligation. Any assets which may be acquired by the
Controlling Company in anticipation of its obligations under this Section shall
be part of the general assets of the Controlling Company. The Controlling
Company's obligation under this Section constitutes a mere promise to pay
certain obligations under the Plan, and a Participant shall be and remain no
more than an unsecured, general creditor of the Controlling Company.

     7.4 Plan Expenses.

          At the direction of the Administrative Committee, expenses incurred
with respect to administering the Plan and Trust shall be charged against
earnings and/or Participants' Account (on a per capita basis, in proportion to
the value of such Accounts or on any other basis) to the extent such costs are
not paid by the Participating Companies. The Administrative Committee may
provide for any expenses specifically attributable to transactions involving an
Account to be charged against such Account.

18

ARTICLE VIII
                            ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE

     8.1 Action.

          Action of the Administrative Committee may be taken with or without a
meeting of committee members; provided, action will be taken only upon the vote
or other affirmative expression of a majority of the committee members qualified
to vote with respect to such action. If a member of the committee is a
Participant or Beneficiary, he will not participate in any decision which solely
affects his own benefit under the Plan. For purposes of administering the Plan,
the Administrative Committee will choose a secretary who will keep minutes of
the committee's proceedings and all records and documents pertaining to the
administration of the Plan. The secretary may execute any certificate or any
other written direction on behalf of the Administrative Committee.

     8.2 Rights and Duties.

          The Administrative Committee will administer the Plan and will have
all powers necessary to accomplish that purpose, including (but not limited to)
the following:

          (a) To construe, interpret and administer the Plan;

          (b) To make determinations required by the Plan, and to maintain
records regarding Participants' and Beneficiaries' benefits hereunder;

          (c) To compute and certify to the Participating Companies the amount
and kinds of benefits payable to Participants and Beneficiaries, and to
determine the time and manner in which such benefits are to be paid;

          (d) To authorize all disbursements by the Participating Companies
pursuant to the Plan;

          (e) To maintain all the necessary records of the administration of the
Plan;

          (f) To make and publish such rules for the regulation of the Plan as
are not inconsistent with the terms hereof;

          (g) To delegate to other individuals or entities from time to time the
performance of any of its duties or responsibilities hereunder, and, to the
extent the Administrative Committee makes any such delegations, any use of the
term "Administrative Committee" in the Plan that relates to such area of
delegation shall be interpreted to refer to and include such other individuals
or entities; and

          (h) To hire agents, accountants, actuaries, consultants and legal
counsel to assist in operating and administering the Plan.

19

The Administrative Committee will have the exclusive right to construe and
interpret the Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility for benefits and to
determine the amount of such benefits, and its decisions on such matters will be
final and conclusive on all parties.

     8.3 Compensation, Indemnity and Liability.

          The Administrative Committee and its members will serve as such
without bond and without compensation for services hereunder. All expenses of
the Administrative Committee will be paid by the Participating Companies. No
member of the committee will be liable for any act or omission of any other
member of the committee, nor for any act or omission on his own part, excepting
his own willful misconduct. The Participating Companies will indemnify and hold
harmless the Administrative Committee and each member thereof against any and
all expenses and liabilities, including reasonable legal fees and expenses,
arising out of his membership on the committee, excepting only expenses and
liabilities arising out of his own willful misconduct.

20

ARTICLE IX
                            AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

     9.1 Amendments.

          The Administrative Committee will have the right, in its sole
discretion, to amend the Plan in whole or in part at any time and from time to
time; provided, any amendment that may (i) result in significantly increased
expenses under the Plan or (ii) materially alter the design of the Plan must be
approved by the Compensation Committee. Any amendment will be in writing and
executed by a duly authorized member of the Administrative Committee. An
amendment to the Plan may modify its terms in any respect whatsoever, and may
include, without limitation, a permanent or temporary freezing of the Plan such
that the Plan will remain in effect with respect to existing Account balances
without permitting any new contributions; provided, no such action may reduce
the amount already credited to a Participant's Account without the affected
Participant's written consent. All Participants and Beneficiaries will be bound
by such amendment.

     9.2 Termination of Plan.

          The Controlling Company reserves the right to discontinue and
terminate the Plan at any time, for any reason. Any action to terminate the Plan
will be taken by the Board or the Compensation Committee in the form of a
written Plan amendment executed by a duly authorized officer of the Controlling
Company. If the Plan is terminated, each Participant will become 100 percent
vested in his Account which will be distributed in a single-sum payment in cash
as soon as practicable after the date the Plan is terminated. The amount of any
such distribution will be determined as of the Valuation Date such termination
distribution is to be processed. Such termination will be binding on all
Participants and Beneficiaries. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the
contrary, a Participant's Account shall be distributed upon Plan termination
only if one or more of the following are satisfied:

          (a) The Plan is terminated within 12 months of a corporate dissolution
taxed under Code Section 331, or with the approval of a bankruptcy court
pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Section 503(b)(1)(A), provided that the amounts deferred
under the Plan are included in Participants' gross incomes in the latest of:

               (i) The calendar year in which the Plan termination occurs;

               (ii) The calendar year in which the amount is no longer subject
     to a substantial risk of forfeiture; or

               (iii) The first calendar year in which the payment is
     administratively practicable.

          (b) The Plan is terminated within the 30 days preceding or the 12
months following a change in control event (as defined under Code Section 409A).
For purposes of this

21

subsection (b), the Plan will be treated as terminated only if all substantially
similar arrangements sponsored by any member of the Controlled Group are
terminated, so that all Participants and all participants under substantially
similar arrangements are required to receive all amounts of compensation
deferred under the terminated arrangements within 12 months of the date of
termination of the arrangements.

          (c) Each of the following are satisfied:

          (1) All arrangements sponsored by any member of the Controlled Group
that would be aggregated with the Plan under Code Section 409A if the same
service provider participated in all of the arrangements are terminated;

          (2) No payments other than payments that would be payable under the
terms of the arrangements if the termination had not occurred are made within 12
months of the termination of the arrangements;

          (3) All payments are made within 24 months of the termination of the
arrangements; and

          (4) No member of the Controlled Group adopts a new arrangement that
would be aggregated with any terminated arrangement under Code Section 409A if
the same service provider participated in both arrangements, at any time within
5 years following the date of termination of the arrangements.

          (d) The Plan is terminated in connection with such other events or
under such other conditions as the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service
may prescribe in generally applicable guidance published in the Internal Revenue
Bulletin.

22

ARTICLE X
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     10.1 Taxation.

          It is the intention of the Controlling Companies that the benefits
payable hereunder will not be deductible by the Participating Companies nor
taxable for federal income tax purposes to Participants or Beneficiaries until
such benefits are paid by the Participating Companies, or the Trust, as the case
may be, to such Participants or Beneficiaries. Without limiting the foregoing,
it is intended that the Plan meet the requirements of Code Section 409A (other
than with respect to amounts that were earned and vested prior to January 1,
2005), and the Administrative Committee shall use its reasonable best efforts to
interpret and administer the Plan in accordance with such requirements. Each
Participant will be taxed for purposes of the Federal Insurance Contributions
Act ("FICA") as of the later of (i) the date that contributions are credited to
the Participant's Account, or (ii) the date that such amounts become vested.
When such benefits are paid hereunder, it is the intention of the Participating
Companies that they will be deductible by the Participating Companies under Code
Section 162.

     10.2 No Employment Contract.

          Nothing herein contained is intended to be nor will be construed as
constituting a contract or other arrangement between a Participating Company and
any Participant to the effect that the Participant will be employed by the
Participating Company for any specific period of time.

     10.3 Headings.

          The headings of the various articles and sections in the Plan are
solely for convenience and will not be relied upon in construing any provisions
hereof. Any reference to a section refers to a section of the Plan unless
specified otherwise.

     10.4 Gender and Number.

          Use of any gender in the Plan will be deemed to include all genders
when appropriate, and use of the singular number will be deemed to include the
plural when appropriate, and vice versa in each instance.

     10.5 Assignment of Benefits.

          The right of a Participant or Beneficiary to receive payments under
the Plan may not be anticipated, alienated, sold, assigned, transferred,
pledged, encumbered, attached or garnished by creditors of such Participant or
Beneficiary, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and then
only to the extent permitted under the terms of the Plan.

23

10.6 Legally Incompetent.

          The Administrative Committee, in its sole discretion, may direct that
payment to be made to an incompetent or disabled person, whether because of
minority or mental or physical disability, be made instead to the guardian of
such person or to the person having custody of such person, without further
liability on the part of a Participating Company for the amount of such payment
to the person on whose account such payment is made.

     10.7 Governing Law.

          The Plan will be construed, administered and governed in all respects
in accordance with applicable federal law (including ERISA) and, to the extent
not preempted by federal law, in accordance with the laws of the State of
Georgia. If any provisions of this instrument are held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof
will continue to be fully effective.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Controlling Company has caused the Plan to be
executed by its duly authorized officer on the 14th day of December, 2005.

          B-I Definitions.

          For purposes of the Senior Executive Subplan, the following terms,

unless a different meaning plainly is required by the context.

     B-1.1 Base Salary means, with respect to an employee for a Plan Year, such
employee's base pay for such Plan Year as determined by the Administrative
Committee, including any portion of such base pay that is deferred under the
Plan or under a Code Section 401(k) plan or Code Section 125 plan maintained by
a Participating Company but excluding any portion of such base pay that is paid
or made available to the employee during the Plan Year either (i) while he is
not an active Participant or (ii) prior to the first regular paycheck in such
Plan Year from which no amount (other than catch-up contributions) is, or could
be, withheld and contributed to the 401(k) Plan on account of whichever of the
following first occurs: (A) such Participant's 401(k) elective contributions
reach the Code Section 402(g) maximum deferral limit for such Plan Year, or (B)
such Participant reaches the Code Section 401(a)(17) maximum compensation limit.

become effective as soon as administratively practicable after he satisfies the
procedures for admission described in Section 2.2; provided, such procedures are
satisfied within 30 days of the date he first became an Eligible Employee.

B-2

B-III Deferrals.

     B-3.1 Deferral Contributions. Each Eligible Employee who is or becomes
eligible to participate in the Senior Executive Subplan for all or any portion

Code Section 401(a)(17) maximum compensation limit.

          (b) Bonus Deferral Election. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth below, a Bonus Deferral Election will provide for the reduction of an
Eligible Employee's Bonus Payment payable during the Plan Year for which the
Bonus Deferral Election is in effect.

     B-3.2 Procedure for Elections. Subject to any modifications, additions or
exceptions that the Administrative Committee, in its sole discretion, deems
necessary, appropriate or helpful, the following terms will apply to Base Salary
Deferral Elections and Bonus Deferral Elections:

          (a) Effective Date.

               (i) Initial Base Salary Deferral Election. A Participant's
     initial Base Salary Deferral Election with respect to his Base Salary for
     any Plan Year will be effective for the first regular paycheck (A) which
     relates to a payroll period ending no earlier than the last day of the
     immediately preceding Plan Year and (B) from which no amount is withheld
     and contributed to the 401(k) Plan paid after the date the Base Salary
     Deferral Election is submitted and becomes effective. To be effective, a
     Participant's initial Base Salary Deferral Election must be made before the
     first day of the Plan Year for which Base Salary Deferral Contributions
     will be made, or, if later and if the Participant has never previously
     participated in, or been covered under, any plan, arrangement or program of
     any member of the Controlled Group that would be required to be aggregated
     with the Plan under Code Section 409A, within 30 days after the date on
     which his participation first becomes effective pursuant to Section B-II,
     or at such earlier time as the Administrative Committee may prescribe. If
     an Eligible Employee

B-3

fails to submit a Base Salary Deferral Election in a timely manner, he will
     be deemed to have elected not to participate in the Plan for that Plan Year
     with respect to his Base Salary.

               (ii) Subsequent Base Salary Deferral Election. A Participant's
     subsequent Base Salary Deferral Election must be made on or before the last
     day of the Plan Year immediately preceding the Plan Year for which he
     desires to participate and in which the Base Salary to be deferred is paid
     or at such earlier time as the Administrative Committee may prescribe.

          (b) Term. A Participant's Base Salary Deferral Election will remain in
effect only for the Plan Year for which it is effective and will terminate on
the earliest of (i) the date the Participant ceases to be an active Participant,
(ii) the date the Participant's Base Salary Deferral Election is revoked [as
provided in Section 3.3(d)], or (iii) the date on which is made the last payment
of Compensation relating to a payroll period ending prior to the last day of the
Plan Year for which the Deferral Election is effective. If a Participant is
transferred from the employment of one Participating Company to the employment
of another Participating Company, his Base Salary Deferral Election with the
first Participating Company will remain in effect and will apply to his Base
Salary from the second Participating Company until the earliest of those events
set forth in the preceding sentence.

          (c) Amount. A Participant may elect to defer his Base Salary payable
in each regular paycheck (beginning with the first regular paycheck from which
no amount is withheld and contributed to the 401(k) Plan) in 1 percent
increments, up to a maximum of 6 percent (or such other maximum percentage
and/or amount, if any, established by the Administrative Committee from time to
time).

          (d) Impact on 401(k) Plan Elections. To the extent necessary to comply
with the requirements of Code Section 409A, a Participant who makes a Base
Salary Deferral Election for a Plan Year will not be permitted to modify or
revoke his deferral election under the 401(k) Plan for such Plan Year; provided,
unless otherwise necessary to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A,
such Participant will be permitted to modify or revoke a separate deferral
election under the 401(k) Plan that applies only to catch-up contributions.

          (e) Bonus Deferral Elections. A Participant may complete and deliver
to the Administrative Committee a Bonus Deferral Election with respect to a
Bonus Payment payable during a Plan Year. The terms of such Bonus Deferral
Election will be determined by reference to the foregoing provisions of this
Section; provided, to be effective, the Bonus Deferral Election must be made by
the latest of the dates described in subsections (e)(i), (e)(ii) and (e)(iii)
hereof, whichever are applicable, or at such earlier time as the Administrative
Committee may prescribe.

               (i) Performance-Based Compensation. If the Bonus Payment
     constitutes performance-based compensation under Code Section 409A, the

B-4

Bonus Deferral Election may be made on any date that is at least 6 months
     prior to the end of the fiscal year to which the Bonus Payment relates;
     provided, the Bonus Payment is not both substantially certain to be paid
     and readily ascertainable on such date; and, provided further, the
     Participant has been continuously employed by a member of the Controlled
     Group from the beginning of such fiscal year (or, if later, the date on
     which the performance criteria for the Bonus Payment are established in
     writing).

               (ii) Initial Year of Participation. If the Participant becomes
     eligible to participate in the Senior Executive Subplan for a portion of
     the Plan Year pursuant to Section B-II after the date on which the
     performance criteria for the Bonus Payment are established in writing, the
     Bonus Deferral Election must be made within 30 days after the date on which
     his participation becomes effective; provided, such Bonus Deferral Election
     will only apply to a portion of the applicable Bonus Payment. Such portion
     shall equal the Participant's Bonus Payment multiplied by the ratio of (A)
     the number of days remaining in the fiscal year to which the Bonus Payment
     relates when the Participant makes his Bonus Deferral Election, divided by
     (B) the number of days remaining in such fiscal year when the Participant
     first became eligible for such Bonus Payment.

               (iii) Default Rule. If subsections (e)(i) and (e)(ii) are
     inapplicable, the Bonus Deferral Election must be made prior to the first
     day of the Plan Year during which begins the fiscal year to which the Bonus
     Payment relates.

          B-IV Matching Contributions.

          The Administrative Committee will credit to the Account of any
Eligible Employee who is eligible for the Senior Executive Subplan a Matching
Contribution equal to 50% of the amount of each such Eligible Participant's
Deferral Contributions for that Plan Year to the extent such Deferral
Contributions do not exceed 6% of such Eligible Participant's Compensation for
such Plan Year. Such Matching Contributions shall vest in accordance with the
vesting schedule applicable to matching contributions under the 401(k) Plan and
shall be credited with earnings and/or losses in accordance with Section 3.5.

          B-V Payment of Account Balances.

     B-5.1 Amount of Distributions. Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.1(a)
to the contrary, if a Participant who is eligible for the Senior Executive
Subplan separates from service with the Controlling Company, all other members
of the Controlled Group and all members of the RTS Controlled Group for any
reason other than death, he (or his Beneficiary or Beneficiaries, if he dies
after such termination of employment but before distribution of his Account)
will be entitled to receive or begin receiving a distribution of the total of:
(i) the entire vested amount credited to his Account, determined as of the
Valuation Date on which such distribution is processed; plus (ii) the vested
amount of Deferral and Matching Contributions made since such Valuation Date. In
addition,

B-5

notwithstanding anything in Section 5.3 to the contrary, if a Participant who is
eligible for the Senior Executive Subplan dies before payment of his benefit
from the Plan is made or commenced, the Beneficiary or Beneficiaries designated
by such Participant in his latest beneficiary designation form filed with the
Administrative Committee will be entitled to receive a distribution of the total
of (i) the entire vested amount credited to such Participant's Account,
determined as of the Valuation Date on which such distribution is processed;
plus (ii) the vested amount of any Deferral and Matching Contributions made
since such Valuation Date.

     B-5.2 Separate Distribution Election for Senior Executive Subplan Benefits.

          (a) In General. A Participant who becomes eligible for the Senior
Executive Subplan after being otherwise eligible to participate in the Plan may
elect, at the time he makes his initial Deferral Election under the Senior
Executive Subplan, to have the portion of his Plan benefit relating to his
participation in the Senior Executive Subplan distributed in quarterly
installments pursuant to Section 5.2(b), without regard to whether he has made
such an election with respect to the remainder of his Plan benefit.

          (b) Separate Changes. A Participant described in subsection (a) hereof
may make a one-time change to the form in which the portion of his Plan benefit
relating to his participation in the Senior Executive Subplan will be
distributed pursuant to Section 5.2(c), without regard to whether he has made
such a change with respect to the portion of his Plan benefit that does not
relate to his participation in the Senior Executive Subplan. Likewise, such a
Participant may make a one-time change to the form in which the portion of his
Plan benefit not relating to his participation in the Senior Executive Subplan
will be distributed pursuant to Section 5.2(c), without regard to whether he has
made such a change with respect to the portion of his Plan benefit that relates
to his participation in the Senior Executive Subplan; provided, the Participant
has not made such a change prior to the beginning of his participation in the
Senior Executive Subplan.

          (c) Separate Application of the 5-year Delay. If a Participant
described in subsection (a) hereof makes a change to the form in which the
portion of his Plan benefit relating to his participation in the Senior
Executive Subplan will be distributed pursuant to Section 5.2(c) and subsection
(b) hereof, the distribution of the portion of his Plan benefit relating to his
participation in the Senior Executive Subplan (but not the portion relating to
his participation outside of the Senior Executive Subplan) will be delayed in
accordance with Sections 5.1(b)(iii) and 5.2(c). Likewise, if such a Participant
makes a change to the form in which the portion of his Plan benefit not relating
to his participation in the Senior Executive Subplan will be distributed
pursuant to Section 5.2(c) and subsection (b) hereof, the distribution of the
portion of his Plan benefit relating to his participation outside of the Senior
Executive Subplan (but not the portion relating to his participation in the
Senior Executive Subplan) will be delayed in accordance with Sections
5.1(b)(iii) and 5.2(c).

     B-5.3 Distributions of Pre-2005 Amounts. Any distribution pursuant to
Section 5.1 of an amount that relates to a Participant's vested Account balance
as of December

B-6

31, 2004, as adjusted for earnings and/or losses pursuant to Section 3.5, will
be made in accordance with the timing rules of Section 5.1(b)(i) and will not be
delayed pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(ii) or 5.1(b)(iii) without regard to whether
the Participant is a Key Employee or has changed his initially elected form of
distribution pursuant to Section 5.2(c).
