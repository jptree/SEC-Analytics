                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - UNAUDITED INTERIM INFORMATION

ITEX Corporation (the "Company") and its wholly-owned  subsidiaries  prepare and
report financial  results using a fiscal year ending July 31. The Company closes
its books at the end of 13  "accounting  cycles,"  which  consist  of four weeks
each. The Company reports quarterly  results using three quarters  consisting of
three of the four-week accounting cycles each and one quarter consisting of four
of the four-week accounting cycles. In prior years, the Company had reported the
four  cycle,  or  16-week  quarter as the fourth  quarter of each  fiscal  year.
Commencing  with the first quarter of the fiscal year ending July 31, 1997,  the
Company will report the four cycle,  or 16-week  quarter as the first quarter of
each  fiscal  year.  This  practice  is  being  implemented  to  provide  better
management of Company operations and to more evenly space the periodic reporting
of  financial  information  to the  public.  Accordingly,  the new dates for the
fiscal ends of the Company's  quarters for public  reporting will be as follows:
first quarter,  November 20; second quarter,  February 12; third quarter, May 7;
fourth quarter, July 31.

This Form 10-Q includes the consolidated financial statements of the Company and
its wholly-owned  subsidiaries.  The  consolidated  balance sheet as of July 31,
1996 is excerpted from the Company's audited financial statements for the fiscal
year then ended. The Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  included in
this Form 10-Q for the interim  periods  ended  November 20, 1996 and October 23
1995  include  all normal  recurring  adjustments  which,  in the opinion of the
Company,  are  necessary  for a fair  statement  of the  results of  operations,
financial  position,  and  cash  flows  as of the  dates  and  for  the  periods
presented.  The Company's  operating  results for the sixteen-week  period ended
November  20, 1996 are not  necessarily  indicative  of the results  that may be
expected for the fiscal year ending July 31, 1997.

The Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements  included in the Company's July
31, 1996 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A should be read in  conjunction  with these
consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 2 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

The Company is engaged in  international  operations  in both the retail  barter
exchange and  corporate  barter areas of the  commercial  barter  industry.  The
Company administers the ITEX Retail Barter Exchange (the Exchange),  which is an
association of business  owners and  professionals  who trade goods and services
with other members of the Exchange.  The Company  promotes the  maximization  of
trade through barter  transactions  that benefit members within the Exchange by:
(a) generating  incremental new business,  (b) conserving members' cash by their
ability to spend ITEX trade dollars,  (c) serving  effectively as an alternative
source of financing, (d) enhancing the lifestyles of members, and (e)

6
 
enabling the sale of slow moving or excess inventories at better values than can
be realized in cash markets.

The Company acts as a third-party  record-keeper  of members'  transactions  and
balances,  which are denominated in ITEX trade dollars.  An ITEX trade dollar is
an  accounting  unit  used by the  Exchange  to  record  the  value of trades as
determined by the buying and selling parties in barter transactions.  ITEX trade
dollars  denote  the right to receive  goods or  services  available  from other
Exchange  members  or the  obligation  to  provide  goods or  services  to other
Exchange  members.  ITEX trade dollars may not be redeemed for cash.  ITEX trade
dollars may be used only in the manner and for the purpose set forth in the ITEX
Trading Rules that govern the Exchange. ITEX trade dollars are not legal tender,
securities, or commodities.

Members of the Exchange pay cash and ITEX trade dollar fees and  commissions  to
the Company. The Company typically receives a cash commission of 5% or 6% on the
purchases  and  sales  made  by  members  of  the   Exchange.   In  addition  to
administering the activities and record-keeping of the Exchange, the Company, as
a member of the  Exchange,  trades as a principal  party in barter  transactions
with other  members.  The Company  also  engages as a  principal  party in trade
transactions   in  the  corporate   barter  area  of  the  industry.   In  these
transactions,  the Company  acquires goods and services that it either sells for
cash or ITEX  trade  dollars or holds in  inventory  for  further  trades in the
corporate barter area or for trading to members of the Exchange.

The Company owns and operates  retail barter  offices in Portland,  Oregon;  St.
Louis,  Missouri; and Orange County,  California.  All other ITEX broker offices
are  independently  owned  and  operated  by ITEX  Licensed  Brokers.  There are
presently 124 broker offices located in 36 states.  In addition,  there are also
approximately  20 foreign  broker  offices,  including 14 in Canada.  One of the
Company's current objectives is aggressive  international  expansion of the ITEX
retail trade  network.  The Company  bears no financial  responsibility  for the
financing of an independent broker office.

The Company  acts as an  intermediary  for the  exchange  of goods and  services
between major companies,  through ITEX USA, Inc., a corporate barter  management
company,  which is the  Company's  exclusive  agent for  marketing the Company's
corporate and  industrial  trading  business of the Company's  corporate  barter
division.  ITEX USA  negotiates  corporate  barter  agreements,  services  these
agreements and sells the inventory it acquires in these  transactions.  In these
transactions,  ITEX USA issues ITEX Cash Equivalent Credits,  which are separate
and  apart  from the ITEX  Retail  Trade  Dollar,  now  used in  accounting  for
transactions in the ITEX Retail Trade Exchange  System.  The revenues  generated
from those  inventories  when sold for cash are divided  between the Company and
ITEX USA.  This is the first and primary  profit  center in each ITEX  corporate
barter  transaction.  The second profit center is a 12%  transaction fee paid by
the ITEX Corporate  Barter client on the Cash Equivalent  Credit portion of each
purchase. This revenue is also divided between the Company and ITEX USA.

The Company operates with the objectives of long-term equity-building while also
ensuring  availability  of sufficient cash for current  operating  requirements.
Accordingly,  the Company may in any period report significant revenue, profits,
and increases in net assets from transactions  denominated in ITEX trade dollars

7
 
or other  noncash  consideration.  Sometimes,  the  Company  invests  in  equity
securities with ITEX trade dollars that have been earned by the Company in trade
transactions.  The companies  invested in are able to use the ITEX trade dollars
received in payment for the stock issued to purchase  goods and services used in
the operation of their businesses.

As a result of this utilization of trade dollars, the Company has accumulated an
investment  portfolio of marketable  equity  securities  totaling  $3,877,000 at
November 20, 1996,  stated at the lower of cost or market.  Also at November 20,
1996, the Company owned inventories of goods and services  totaling  $8,699,000,
stated at the lower of cost or market, which was available for corporate trading
or trading to members  within the Exchange,  which  increases  cash  commissions
earned by the Company, for exchange for equity securities of other companies, or
for consumption by the Company in providing for its own operating needs.

In 1993 the Company  purchased a 49% interest in Associated  Reciprocal  Traders
("ART"), a trading company located in Zug, Switzerland.  ART acts as a buyer and
seller of goods and services using barter,  usually dealing with parties outside
the U.S.  Through its  interest in ART,  the Company  attained a presence in the
international  corporate  barter  marketplace.  The Company's share of ART's net
assets and  results of  operations  were  included  in the  Company's  financial
statements  using the equity  method of  accounting  through July 31,  1996.  On
November 27, 1996,  the majority owner of ART informed the Company of its intent
to take  immediate  steps to  distribute  all the  assets  of ART and to end the
relationship with the Company.  The Company had previously  intended to reinvest
its share of the earnings of this venture indefinitely and, accordingly, had not
provided income taxes on its share of ART's undistributed  earnings. As a result
of the  inability  to  continue  to reinvest  its share of ART's  earnings,  the
Company  recognized a deferred  provision for income taxes of $1,247,000  during
the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended July 31, 1996.

NOTE 5 - INVESTMENT IN FOREIGN EQUITY AFFILIATE

The Company owns a 49% interest in Associated  Reciprocal Traders, Inc. ("ART"),
a foreign corporation based in Switzerland with international  commercial barter
operations.  ART engages in commercial barter transactions as a buyer and seller
of goods and services with companies and businesses  that are based in countries
outside the United States, as well as U.S. companies. Through July 31, 1996, the
Company  accounted for its  investment in and share of net income or loss of ART
by the equity  method.  The Company's  equity share of ART's net income  (loss),
after  amortization of the difference  between investment cost and the Company's
proportionate  share of  underlying  assets,  was  ($90,000) for the fiscal year
ended July 31,  1996,  $958,000  for the fiscal  year ended July 31,  1995,  and
$632,000 for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1994.

All of the  undistributed  earnings of the foreign affiliate were reinvested and
were not  expected to be remitted to the parent  company.  On November 27, 1996,
the majority  owner of ART informed the Company of its intent to take  immediate
steps to distribute all the assets of ART and to end the  relationship  with the
Company.  The Company  had  previously  intended  to  reinvest  its share of the
earnings of this venture indefinitely and, accordingly,  had not provided income
taxes on its share of ART's undistributed earnings. As a result of the inability
to continue to reinvest its share of ART's  earnings,  the Company  recognized a
deferred  provision for income taxes of $1,247,000  during the fourth quarter of
the fiscal year ended July 31,  1996,  which was  reported as a reduction of the
Company's  share of equity in net  income  (loss) of  foreign  affiliate  in the
statement of operations for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 1996.

The   assets  of  ART  as  of   November   20,   1996   consist   primarily   of
available-for-sale securities, none of which are securities of ITEX Corporation.
The majority owner

                                       9
 
of ART has agreed to distribute  the assets on a basis expected to result in the
Company  realizing an amount not less than the carrying  value of the  Company's
investment.  The Company expects to be able to meet any  requirements to pay the
current  deferred tax  liability by selling a portion of the  available-for-sale
securities to be received.  Commencing August 1, 1996, the Company is accounting
for its investment in ART by the cost method.

NOTE 6 - BANK LINE OF CREDIT

On December 4, 1996,  the Company's  primary bank agreed to a new line of credit
arrangement  with a term  through  December  31,  1997.  Pursuant to the line of
credit,  the Company may borrow up to $250,000 on a short-term basis for working
capital  purposes.  The interest rate  applicable to borrowings  pursuant to the
facility is equal to the bank's  prime rate of interest  plus 1.5%.  The maximum
amount of cash borrowings that may be outstanding at any time is determined by a
borrowing  base  formula  related  to  available   collateral.   Borrowings  are
collateralized by the Company's accounts receivable, fixed assets and inventory.
As of November 20, 1996,  the Company had no  borrowings  outstanding  under the
bank credit facility. Based on available collateral,  the entire facility amount
of credit of $250,000 was available to the Company as of November 20, 1996.

NOTE 7 - TRADE DOLLARS ISSUED IN EXCESS OF EARNED

At November 20, 1996,  the Company had  expended  154,000 ITEX trade  dollars in
excess of the amount of trade dollars  earned by the Company.  This situation is
commonly  referred to in the  commercial  barter  industry as a "negative  trade
balance."

Trade dollars issued in excess of earned by the Company is specifically provided
for in the ITEX Trading Rules that govern the Exchange.  Such  provisions  allow
the Company to issue trade dollars in excess of earned within certain  guideline
amounts. This provides the Company with additional liquidity and the opportunity
to complete  advantageous  purchase  transactions  that  benefit the Company and
Exchange members. The Company would be ultimately obligated to provide goods and
services to Exchange  members to offset any amounts of trade  dollars  issued in
excess of earned.  This could be  accomplished  by the sale for trade dollars of
the  inventories for which  acquisition  resulted in the trade dollars issued in
excess of earned or other inventories,  by otherwise earning trade dollars, or a
combination of both.

NOTE 8 - CAPITAL STOCK

Private  Placement.  Effective  January  1, 1996,  the  Company  entered  into a
Regulation  S  transaction  with  Wycliff  Fund,  Inc.  ("Wycliff"),  a  foreign
corporation.  Wycliff agreed to purchase 1,022,495 units of the Company's equity
securities  over a  two-year  period  for $4.89 per  unit,  equaling  a total of
$5,000,000.  Each unit  consists  of one share of common  stock and  warrants to
purchase two shares of common stock. One warrant entitles the holder to purchase
one  share  of  common  stock  at an  exercise  price of  $4.89  per  share,  is
exercisable from and after two years from the date of issuance, and expires five
years  from the date of  issuance.  The other  warrant  entitles  the  holder to
purchase one share of common stock at an exercise  price of $6.12 per share,  is
exercisable from and

                                       10
 
after four years from the date of issuance,  and expires ten years from the date
of issuance.  Wycliff was  required to pay the purchase  price of the units at a
minimum rate of $625,000 per quarter.

Through July 31, 1996, the Company  received  $1,250,000 from Wycliff and issued
255,624 shares of common stock and the Company also issued  warrants to purchase
255,624  shares  of  common  stock at an  exercise  price of  $4.89  per  share,
exercisable from and after two years from the date of issuance,  with expiration
five years from the date of issuance, and warrants to purchase 255,624 shares of
common stock at an exercise price of $6.12 per share, exercisable from and after
four years from the date of issuance, with expiration ten years from the date of
issuance.

The private  placement  provided that if Wycliff failed to pay at least $625,000
in any calendar  quarter,  the Company  could,  at its sole  option,  decline to
thereafter sell any of the then  unpurchased  units to Wycliff.  Wycliff did not
pay the purchase  price that would have been due for the calendar  quarter ended
September 30, 1996, and therefore the Company has canceled the remaining portion
of the private placement.

Stock  Option  Plan.  The Board of  Directors  adopted a new stock  option  plan
applicable to directors,  officers,  employees,  and  consultants of the Company
effective  December 27, 1996,  pursuant to which 995,000  shares of common stock
were  reserved  for  issuance,  all of which  were  granted to  optionees  at an
exercise price of $3.75 per share. Exercise prices for the options granted under
the new  plan  are  equal  to  market  value  on the  date of  grant  and may be
exercisable  for up to five years.  The Company  intends to present the new plan
for approval by the  Company's  shareholders  at the annual  meeting.  It is the
intention of the Company to file a Form S-8 registration with the Securities and
Exchange  Commission  with  respect  to the  shares of common  stock  underlying
options to be issued pursuant to the plan.

Stock Split. At the annual meeting of the Company's shareholders on May 3, 1996,
the  Company's  shareholders  approved a  two-for-one  forward  stock split with
respect  to the  Company's  common  stock.  The  stock  split  has not yet  been
implemented by the Company.  Upon  implementation  of the stock split, all share
and per share data  included  in the  Company's  financial  statements  would be
restated to give effect to the stock split.

NOTE 9 - ACQUISITION OF 50% INTEREST IN BUSINESS EXCHANGE
         INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND RELATED LITIGATION

On January 24, 1996,  the Company  acquired a 100% common stock interest in SLI,
Inc. ("SLI"),  a Nevada  corporation now known as IME, Inc., in exchange for the
issuance to SLI's former  shareholders of 60,000 shares of the Company's  common
stock  valued  at  approximately   $645,000.   The  Company  then  made  a  cash
contribution  to the capital of SLI of $1,750,000 and made a loan of $300,000 to
SLI.  Also on January 24, 1996,  SLI  purchased a 50% common  stock  interest in
Business  Exchange  International  Corporation  ("BXI"),  a Nevada  corporation,
pursuant to rights to purchase  such  interest  that had been assigned to SLI by
the former  shareholders  of SLI. SLI paid $1,750,000 for the common interest in
BXI by the  purchase of newly issued  common stock of BXI and, in addition,  SLI
loaned

                                       11
 
$300,000  to BXI.  BXI owns and  operates  one of the leading  organized  barter
exchanges in the United States.

On February  12,  1996,  a complaint  was filed on behalf of the Company and its
wholly owned  subsidiary,  SLI, Inc.,  against Saul Yarmak,  Stephen  Friedland,
Business Exchange  International  Corp., BX International,  Inc., Joel Sens, and
David Lawson.  The complaint,  filed in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon
for  Multnomah  County  Case No.  9602-01076,  asserted  claims  for  breach  of
contract,   specific  performance,   declaratory  judgment,  fraud,  defamation,
unlawful trade  practices,  and  interference  with economic  relationships.  It
sought to recover damages for allegedly  disparaging  remarks made by certain of
the  defendants  against  ITEX and for a court  ruling  that SLI  acquired a 50%
interest in the BXI trade exchange owned by one or more of the defendants.

On April 30, 1996, defendants Yarmak, Friedland, Business Exchange International
Corp.,  and BX  International,  Inc.,  filed  an  answer  denying  the  material
allegations and asserting a counterclaim for attorney fees.

On  October  11,  1996,  ITEX  Corporation  moved for  dismissal  of its  claims
(business  defamation,  unlawful trade practices and interference  with economic
relationships),  without prejudice,  against  defendants.  On that same date the
motion  was  granted  and  leave  granted  to file an  Amended  Complaint.  That
complaint  is styled  SLI,  Inc. v. Saul  Yarmak,  Stephen  Friedland,  Business
Exchange  International  Corp. and BX International,  Inc. The Amended Complaint
restates  the  claims  against  defendants  for  breach  of  contract,  specific
performance,  declaratory  judgment and fraud. By dismissing ITEX  Corporation's
claims without  prejudice,  ITEX may, if it chooses,  reinstitute its claims for
business  defamation,  unlawful trade practices and  interference  with economic
relationships.  Proceeding  under the  Amended  Complaint  permits an  expedited
determination of the core contract issues raised,  that is, whether BXI breached
its contract with SLI by asserting  that the BXI Trade  Exchange is not an asset
of BXI. The defendants have asserted counterclaims for attorney's fees and fraud
against SLI in defendants' amended answer and counterclaims.

The  potential  outcome  of this  lawsuit is  uncertain.  However,  the  Company
believes that SLI has meritorious  arguments in favor of its contract  positions
and against defendants' counterclaims. The Company believes that a solution will
be reached  either through  negotiation or through  completion of the litigation
process.  The trial date has been set for February 24,  1997.  Legal  counsel is
unable to evaluate the  probability of a favorable or unfavorable  outcome or to
estimate  the  range of  potential  recovery  on the  plaintiff's  claims or any
potential loss on the defendant's counterclaims.

NOTE 10 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On December 19, 1996,  the Company  announced  the signing of an agreement  with
Ihlas Holdings, a major Turkish corporation,  to license an ITEX Barter Exchange
in the Middle  East,  to be called  Ihlas ITEX Barter SA.  Under the  agreement,
which is effective January 1, 1997, Ihlas Holdings receives exclusive use of the
ITEX name, trademarks, and proprietary barter accounting and management software
for  use  in  Turkey.   The  Company  will  receive  royalties  based  on  trade
transactions  generated  through  the new system,  which will enable  Ihlas ITEX
clients to trade

                                       12
 
with ITEX members in other countries.  Ihlas Holdings is one of Turkey's largest
corporations,  has  57  subsidiaries,  which  include  interests  in  chemicals,
textiles,  food,  electronics,   health  care,  construction,   media,  banking,
insurance,  and international trade. Ihlas has already taken steps to expand the
Ihlas ITEX barter network into the nearby states of Kazakhstan,  Turkistan,  and
Azerbijan.

ITEM 2.     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
            FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

BUSINESS, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Business and Plan of Operation

The Company is engaged in  international  operations  in both the retail  barter
exchange and  corporate  barter areas of the  commercial  barter  industry.  The
Company administers the ITEX Retail Barter Exchange (the Exchange),  which is an
association of business  owners and  professionals  who trade goods and services
with other members of the Exchange.  The Company  promotes the  maximization  of
trade through barter  transactions  that benefit members within the Exchange by:
(a) generating  incremental new business,  (b) conserving members' cash by their
ability to spend ITEX trade dollars,  (c) serving  effectively as an alternative
source of financing,  (d) enhancing the lifestyles of members,  and (e) enabling
the sale of slow  moving or excess  inventories  at  better  values  than can be
realized in cash markets.

The Company acts as a third-party  record-keeper  of members'  transactions  and
balances,  which are denominated in ITEX trade dollars.  An ITEX trade dollar is
an  accounting  unit  used by the  Exchange  to  record  the  value of trades as
determined by the buying and selling parties in barter transactions.  ITEX trade
dollars  denote  the right to receive  goods or  services  available  from other
Exchange  members  or the  obligation  to  provide  goods or  services  to other
Exchange  members.  ITEX trade dollars may not be redeemed for cash.  ITEX trade
dollars may be used only in the manner and for the purpose set forth in the ITEX
Trading Rules that govern the Exchange.
ITEX trade dollars are not legal tender, securities, or commodities.

Members of the Exchange pay cash and ITEX trade dollar fees and  commissions  to
the Company. The Company typically receives a cash commission of 5% or 6% on the
purchases  and  sales  made  by  members  of  the   Exchange.   In  addition  to
administering the activities and record-keeping of the Exchange, the Company, as
a member of the  Exchange,  trades as a principal  party in barter  transactions
with other  members.  The Company  also  engages as a  principal  party in trade
transactions   in  the  corporate   barter  area  of  the  industry.   In  these
transactions,  the Company  acquires goods and services that it either sells for
cash or ITEX  trade  dollars or holds in  inventory  for  further  trades in the
corporate barter area or for trading to members of the Exchange.

The Company owns and operates  retail barter  offices in Portland,  Oregon;  St.
Louis,  Missouri; and Orange County,  California.  All other ITEX broker offices
are  independently  owned  and  operated  by ITEX  Licensed  Brokers.  There are
presently 124 broker offices located in 36 states.  In addition,  there are also
approximately  20 foreign  broker  offices,  including 14 in Canada.  One of the
Company's current objectives is aggressive  international  expansion of the ITEX

                                       13
 
retail trade  network.  The Company  bears no financial  responsibility  for the
financing of an independent broker office.

The Company  acts as an  intermediary  for the  exchange  of goods and  services
between major companies  through ITEX USA, Inc., a corporate  barter  management
company,  which is the  Company's  exclusive  agent for  marketing the Company's
corporate and  industrial  trading  business of the Company's  corporate  barter
division.  ITEX USA  negotiates  corporate  barter  agreements,  services  these
agreements and sells the inventory it acquires in these  transactions.  In these
transactions,  ITEX USA issues ITEX Cash Equivalent Credits,  which are separate
and  apart  from the ITEX  Retail  Trade  Dollar,  now  used in  accounting  for
transactions in the ITEX Retail Trade Exchange  System.  The revenues  generated
from those  inventories  when sold for cash are divided  between the Company and
ITEX USA.  This is the first and primary  profit  center in each ITEX  corporate
barter  transaction.  The second profit center is a 12%  transaction fee paid by
the ITEX Corporate  Barter client on the Cash Equivalent  Credit portion of each
purchase. This revenue is also divided between the Company and ITEX USA.

The Company operates with the objectives of long-term equity-building while also
ensuring  availability  of sufficient cash for current  operating  requirements.
Accordingly,  the Company may in any period report significant revenue, profits,
and increases in net assets from transactions  denominated in ITEX trade dollars
or other  noncash  consideration.  Sometimes,  the  Company  invests  in  equity
securities with ITEX trade dollars that have been earned by the Company in trade
transactions.  The companies  invested in are able to use the ITEX trade dollars
received in payment for the stock issued to purchase  goods and services used in
the operation of their businesses.

As a result of this utilization of trade dollars, the Company has accumulated an
investment  portfolio of marketable  equity  securities  totaling  $3,877,000 at
November 20, 1996,  stated at the lower of cost or market.  Also at November 20,
1996, the Company owned inventories of goods and services  totaling  $8,699,000,
stated at the lower of cost or market, which was available for corporate trading
or trading to members  within the Exchange,  which  increases  cash  commissions
earned by the Company, for exchange for equity securities of other companies, or
for consumption by the Company in providing for its own operating needs.

In 1993 the Company  purchased a 49% interest in Associated  Reciprocal  Traders
("ART"), a trading company located in Zug, Switzerland.  ART acts as a buyer and
seller of goods and services using barter,  usually dealing with parties outside
the U.S.  Through its  interest in ART,  the Company  attained a presence in the
international  corporate  barter  marketplace.  The Company's share of ART's net
assets and  results of  operations  were  included  in the  Company's  financial
statements  using the equity  method of  accounting  through July 31, 1996.  The
Company's  equity share of ART's net income (loss),  after  amortization  of the
difference  between  investment  cost and the Company's  proportionate  share of
underlying  assets,  was  ($90,000)  for the fiscal  year  ended July 31,  1996,
$958,000  for the fiscal year ended July 31,  1995,  and $632,000 for the fiscal
year ended July 31, 1994.

On November  27,  1996,  the  majority  owner of ART informed the Company of its
intent to take  immediate  steps to distribute  all the assets of ART and to end
the

14
 
relationship with the Company.  The Company had previously  intended to reinvest
its share of the earnings of this venture indefinitely and, accordingly, had not
provided income taxes on its share of ART's undistributed  earnings. As a result
of the  inability  to  continue  to reinvest  its share of ART's  earnings,  the
Company  recognized a deferred  provision for income taxes of $1,247,000  during
the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 1996.

The   assets  of  ART  as  of   November   20,   1996   consist   primarily   of
available-for-sale securities, none of which are securities of ITEX Corporation.
The  majority  owner of ART has  agreed  to  distribute  the  assets  on a basis
expected to result in the Company realizing an amount not less than the carrying
value of the Company's  investment.  The Company  expects to be able to meet any
requirements  to pay the current  deferred tax liability by selling a portion of
the available-for-sale securities to be received. Commencing August 1, 1996, the
Company is accounting for its investment in ART by the cost method.

During  the last  several  years,  the  Company  started  and  operated  a media
department,  which  exchanged  media products owned by the Company for due bills
for  prepaid  advertising  credits on radio  stations  across the U.S.  The four
Company-owned  products included the Image Audio Music Production Library, , the
Golden Age of Radio Theatre,  the New Rock Countdown,  and Flashback ... Moments
in Time.  During the fourth  quarter of the fiscal year ended July 31, 1996, the
Company  sold  certain  media  inventory  and  reduced  the  scope of its  media
operations in order to improve the Company's ongoing cash flow.

Development Activities

On December 19, 1996,  the Company  announced  the signing of an agreement  with
Ihlas Holdings, a major Turkish corporation,  to license an ITEX Barter Exchange
in the Middle  East,  to be called  Ihlas ITEX Barter SA.  Under the  agreement,
which is effective January 1, 1997, Ihlas Holdings receives exclusive use of the
ITEX name, trademarks, and proprietary barter accounting and management software
for  use  in  Turkey.   The  Company  will  receive  royalties  based  on  trade
transactions  generated  through  the new system,  which will enable  Ihlas ITEX
clients to trade with ITEX members in other countries.  Ihlas Holdings is one of
Turkey's largest corporations,  has 57 subsidiaries,  which include interests in
chemicals,  textiles,  food,  electronics,  health  care,  construction,  media,
banking,  insurance,  and international  trade. Ihlas has already taken steps to
expand the Ihlas ITEX  barter  network  into the  nearby  states of  Kazakhstan,
Turkistan, and Azerbijan.

The Company has developed a comprehensive training program for its brokers. New
brokers come to the training  center at the  Company's  Portland,  Oregon for an
intensive week of initial training before receiving the credential of "Associate
Broker." They are then permitted to set up offices and act as barter brokers for
the Company.  After  demonstrating  adequate  competence and achieving specified
performance levels, they return to the training center for an additional week of
training before receiving the credential of "ITEX Licensed Broker."

                                       15
 
The Company has  developed  the largest and most  innovative  electronic  barter
exchange  in the  industry.  The system is modeled  after the NASDAQ  electronic
market quotation system. In a commercial barter exchange, the exchange acts as a
third  party  recordkeeper  for all  parties  who join the  barter  system.  One
advantage of this system is that it enables multi-lateral trade to take place.

Recent  technological  improvements  include a  software  update of the  Account
Information  Maintenance  program utilized by ITEX Brokers, a software update of
the  BarterWire  program  which is utilized by both ITEX Brokers and ITEX Retail
Trade Exchange Members, and developing access on the Internet.

During  the  fiscal  year  1995,   the  Company   completed  an  agreement  with
International  Trade Exchange  (ITEX) Corp., a Vancouver B.C. based company,  to
operate the Canadian  barter  company.  International  Trade Exchange Corp. does
business  in  Canada  under  the  names  ITEX  and  Bartercard.  In spite of the
similarity of names, ITEX Corporation (U.S.) and  ITEX/Bartercard  (Canada) have
never had a business  relationship in the past. Under the terms of the agreement
ITEX  acquired  the rights to the name and  trademarks  of  International  Trade
Exchange  together  with the right to acquire its client  base and  assets.  The
addition of the affiliation with ITEX/Bartercard and TROC/Canada will more fully
enable ITEX clients to do business coast-to-coast in both the U.S. and Canada.

The  Company  has  pioneered  electronic  trading  with its  BarterWire  system,
introduced  by the  Company  nearly a decade  ago.  Using  BarterWire,  Exchange
members can buy and sell products and services  through a personal  computer and
modem from  anywhere  in the world where  telephone  service is  available.  The
Company has continued to enhance its BarterWire software so that users can trade
more efficiently through the Exchange system.  Latest enhanced versions are more
user friendly with features  familiar to those who are accustomed to the Windows
environment.  It  also  includes  color  and  graphic  capabilities  for  better
presentation of products and services offered through the system.

The Company has also made BarterWire  available to clients through the Internet,
complete with its own gateway and web server.  This enables  Exchange members to
enjoy the advantages of the latest  version of BarterWire  together with savings
on long distance charges and a larger electronic marketplace.

Another  electronic  trading  feature  introduced by the Company is a "fax-back"
system for  Exchange  clients,  which  enables  Exchange  members to request and
receive their account  records,  company data, ITEX business forms,  product and
service lists, and other information by fax.

The  ITEX  Express  card   continues  to  enhance   trade  among  ITEX  clients,
particularly  when taken in concert with other electronic  trading  innovations.
The ITEX Express card is the Company's  debit-credit card for barter,  the first
of its kind in the U.S.  The  card  can be used  for  identification  or to make
purchases using a three part voucher form or point-of-sale (POS) terminal.  ITEX
has  encouraged  the use of POS terminals as a way to speed barter  transactions
and increase the volume of trade.

Management believes that electronic trading systems such as BarterWire, Internet
access, the ITEX Express card, and the fax-back  information and trading service

16
 
represent the next major step forward in the development of the barter industry.
By its early involvement in the electronic marketplace, ITEX believes it will be
positioned to take full advantage of future developments in this area.

The  Company  believes  that  new  technologies  and  the  emerging   electronic
marketplace  have  the  potential  to  profoundly  affect  the way  business  is
conducted. As this new marketplace emerges, the Company is positioning itself to
take full advantage of this trend. The Company is already becoming recognized as
an industry leader in this field. As the transition to electronic business takes
place, ITEX intends to play a major role.

Other  assets  includes  costs  of  purchasing  and  developing  certain  of the
Company's information and communication systems. During fiscal 1996, the Company
continued work on  development  projects that had been commenced in prior years.
Since these are mature  projects  and  systems,  technological  feasibility  was
present,  resulting  in the  capitalization  of  most of the  development  costs
incurred in fiscal 1996, in accordance with the Company's accounting policy. The
increase in the level of research and development  costs was attributable to the
nature of the activities in fiscal 1996, which  essentially  consisted of coding
and other activities connected with constructing the systems. A large portion of
the  development  costs were paid to independent  consultants and specialists in
the particular systems areas and are not fixed costs of the Company.

Research  and  development  during the past two fiscal years has focused both on
technological  improvements  and  international  expansion.  During  the  fiscal
quarter  ended  November  20,  1996,  the  Company  spent a total of  $57,000 on
research and development for its communication and information systems, of which
$24,000 was capitalized and $33,000 was charged to expense.

The ITEX symbol and name have, in the past,  been  registered  trademarks of the
Company.  A new application for the ITEX symbol and name has been filed with the
Patent and Trademark Office.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overall Financial Position.  At November 20, 1996, the Company's working capital
ratio  was  1.0  to 1,  based  on  current  assets  of  $2,821,000  and  current
liabilities of $2,845,000. The Company's working capital ratio at July 31, 1996,
was 1.1 to 1, based on current assets of $2,827,000  and current  liabilities of
$2,566,000.  Current  liabilities  includes $1,247,000 in current deferred taxes
related to earnings to be  remitted  as a result of the  termination  of the ART
foreign  venture.  The  net  assets  to be  received,  consisting  primarily  of
available-for-sale  securities,  are included in the long-term classification of
investment in foreign equity affiliate of $3,197,000.  The Company expects to be
able to meet any  requirements  to pay the current  deferred  tax  liability  by
selling a portion of the available-for-sale securities to be received.

Total  stockholders'  equity increased to $20,985,000 at November 20, 1996, from
$20,383,000 at July 31, 1996. The primary increase in  stockholders'  equity was
from the Company's continued profitable operations.

                                       17
 
The  Statement of Cash Flows  indicates  negative  cash flow from  operations of
$24,000 for the first quarter of fiscal 1997, which is a significant improvement
from  negative  cash flow from  operations  of $534,000 for the first quarter of
fiscal 1996. The Company believes that cash fees and commissions,  cash that can
be  obtained  from  the  sale  of  inventories  and  available-for-sale   equity
securities at the  discretion  of the Company,  and cash that would be available
from the sale of equity and debt securities of the Company will be sufficient to
fund cash operating needs of the Company while continuing to follow the strategy
of mixing cash and trade activities so as to maximize  long-term equity building
and shareholder value. Furthermore,  the Company is presently incurring negative
cash flow  with  respect  to  several  development  projects.  At the  Company's
discretion,   it  could  conserve  cash  by  suspending  or  terminating   these
activities.  However,  there  can  be no  assurance  that  adequate  funds  from
operations  or  any  other  sources  will  continue  to be  available  on  terms
acceptable to the Company.

Private  Placement.  Effective  January  1, 1996,  the  Company  entered  into a
Regulation  S  transaction  with  Wycliff  Fund,  Inc.  ("Wycliff"),  a  foreign
corporation.  Wycliff agreed to purchase 1,022,495 units of the Company's equity
securities  over a  two-year  period  for $4.89 per  unit,  equaling  a total of
$5,000,000.  Each unit  consists  of one share of common  stock and  warrants to
purchase two shares of common stock. One warrant entitles the holder to purchase
one  share  of  common  stock  at an  exercise  price of  $4.89  per  share,  is
exercisable from and after two years from the date of issuance, and expires five
years  from the date of  issuance.  The other  warrant  entitles  the  holder to
purchase one share of common stock at an exercise  price of $6.12 per share,  is
exercisable from and after four years from the date of issuance, and expires ten
years from the date of issuance.  Wycliff was required to pay the purchase price
of the units at a minimum rate of $625,000 per quarter.

Through July 31, 1996, the Company  received  $1,250,000 from Wycliff and issued
255,624 shares of common stock and the Company also issued  warrants to purchase
255,624  shares  of  common  stock at an  exercise  price of  $4.89  per  share,
exercisable from and after two years from the date of issuance,  with expiration
five years from the date of issuance, and warrants to purchase 255,624 shares of
common stock at an exercise price of $6.12 per share, exercisable from and after
four years from the date of issuance, with expiration ten years from the date of
issuance.

The private  placement  provided that if Wycliff failed to pay at least $625,000
in any calendar  quarter,  the Company  could,  at its sole  option,  decline to
thereafter sell any of the then  unpurchased  units to Wycliff.  Wycliff did not
pay the purchase  price that would have been due for the calendar  quarter ended
September 30, 1996, and therefore the Company has canceled the remaining portion
of the private placement.

Stock  Option  Plan.  The Board of  Directors  adopted a new stock  option  plan
applicable to directors,  officers,  employees,  and  consultants of the Company
effective  December 27, 1996,  pursuant to which 995,000  shares of common stock
were  reserved  for  issuance,  all of which  were  granted to  optionees  at an
exercise price of $3.75 per share. Exercise prices for the options granted under
the new  plan  are  equal  to  market  value  on the  date of  grant  and may be
exercisable  for up to five years.  The Company  intends to present the new plan
for approval by the

18
 
Company's shareholders at the annual meeting. It is the intention of the Company
to file a Form S-8 registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission with
respect to the shares of common stock  underlying  options to be issued pursuant
to the plan.

Stock Split. At the annual meeting of the Company's shareholders on May 3, 1996,
the  Company's  shareholders  approved a  two-for-one  forward  stock split with
respect  to the  Company's  common  stock.  The  stock  split  has not yet  been
implemented by the Company.  Upon  implementation  of the stock split, all share
and per share data  included  in the  Company's  financial  statements  would be
restated to give effect to the stock split.

Bank Line of Credit. On December 4, 1996, the Company's primary bank agreed to a
new line of credit  arrangement with a term through December 31, 1997.  Pursuant
to the line of credit,  the Company  may borrow up to  $250,000 on a  short-term
basis for working capital  purposes.  The interest rate applicable to borrowings
pursuant  to the  facility is equal to the bank's  prime rate of  interest  plus
1.5%. The maximum amount of cash  borrowings that may be outstanding at any time
is  determined  by a borrowing  base formula  related to  available  collateral.
Borrowings are collateralized by the Company's accounts receivable, fixed assets
and  inventory.  As  of  November  20,  1996,  the  Company  had  no  borrowings
outstanding under the bank credit facility.  Based on available collateral,  the
entire  facility amount of credit of $250,000 was available to the Company as of
November 20, 1996.

Acquisition of 50% Interest in Business Exchange  International  Corporation and
Related  Litigation.  On January 24,  1996,  the Company  acquired a 100% common
stock  interest in SLI, Inc.  ("SLI"),  a Nevada  corporation  now known as IME,
Inc., in exchange for the issuance to SLI's former shareholders of 60,000 shares
of the Company's common stock valued at approximately $645,000. The Company then
made a cash  contribution to the capital of SLI of $1,750,000 and made a loan of
$300,000 to SLI.  Also on January 24,  1996,  SLI  purchased a 50% common  stock
interest  in  Business  Exchange  International  Corporation  ("BXI"),  a Nevada
corporation, pursuant to rights to purchase such interest that had been assigned
to SLI by the former  shareholders  of SLI. SLI paid  $1,750,000  for the common
interest in BXI by the  purchase  of newly  issued  common  stock of BXI and, in
addition,  SLI loaned  $300,000 to BXI. BXI owns and operates one of the leading
organized barter exchanges in the United States.

On February  12,  1996,  a complaint  was filed on behalf of the Company and its
wholly owned  subsidiary,  SLI, Inc.,  against Saul Yarmak,  Stephen  Friedland,
Business Exchange  International  Corp., BX International,  Inc., Joel Sens, and
David Lawson.  The complaint,  filed in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon
for  Multnomah  County  Case No.  9602-01076,  asserted  claims  for  breach  of
contract,   specific  performance,   declaratory  judgment,  fraud,  defamation,
unlawful trade  practices,  and  interference  with economic  relationships.  It
sought to recover damages for allegedly  disparaging  remarks made by certain of
the  defendants  against  ITEX and for a court  ruling  that SLI  acquired a 50%
interest in the BXI trade exchange owned by one or more of the defendants.

                                       19
 
On April 30, 1996, defendants Yarmak, Friedland, Business Exchange International
Corp.,  and BX  International,  Inc.,  filed  an  answer  denying  the  material
allegations and asserting a counterclaim for attorney fees.

On  October  11,  1996,  ITEX  Corporation  moved for  dismissal  of its  claims
(business  defamation,  unlawful trade practices and interference  with economic
relationships),  without prejudice,  against  defendants.  On that same date the
motion  was  granted  and  leave  granted  to file an  Amended  Complaint.  That
complaint  is styled  SLI,  Inc. v. Saul  Yarmak,  Stephen  Friedland,  Business
Exchange  International  Corp. and BX International,  Inc. The Amended Complaint
restates  the  claims  against  defendants  for  breach  of  contract,  specific
performance,  declaratory  judgment and fraud. By dismissing ITEX  Corporation's
claims without  prejudice,  ITEX may, if it chooses,  reinstitute its claims for
business  defamation,  unlawful trade practices and  interference  with economic
relationships.  Proceeding  under the  Amended  Complaint  permits an  expedited
determination of the core contract issues raised,  that is, whether BXI breached
its contract with SLI by asserting  that the BXI Trade  Exchange is not an asset
of BXI. The defendants have asserted counterclaims for attorney's fees and fraud
against SLI in defendants' amended answer and counterclaims.

The  potential  outcome  of this  lawsuit is  uncertain.  However,  the  Company
believes that SLI has meritorious  arguments in favor of its contract  positions
and against defendants' counterclaims. The Company believes that a solution will
be reached  either through  negotiation or through  completion of the litigation
process.  The trial date has been set for February 24,  1997.  Legal  counsel is
unable to evaluate the  probability of a favorable or unfavorable  outcome or to
estimate  the  range of  potential  recovery  on the  plaintiff's  claims or any
potential loss on the defendant's counterclaims.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Comparison  of  Sixteen-Week  Period ended  November 30, 1996 (First  Quarter of
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fiscal 1997) and  Twelve-Week  Period ended  October 23, 1995 (First  Quarter of
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fiscal 1996)
- ------------

Overall Operating Results

Total  revenue  decreased to $5,657,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 1997 from
$6,678,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 1996. Income from operations increased
to  $649,000  in the first  quarter of fiscal  1997 from  $402,000  in the first
quarter of fiscal  1996.  In the first  quarter of fiscal  1997,  the  Company's
revenue  and profit  from its core  retail  trade  exchange  business  increased
significantly.  This higher-margin revenue more than offset the effects of lower
revenue from decreased activity in corporate trading in the current quarter.

Equity in net income from foreign affiliate was $543,000 in the first quarter of
fiscal  1996.  On November  27,  1996,  the  majority  owner of ART informed the
Company of its intent to take  immediate  steps to distribute  all the assets of
ART and to end the relationship with the Company. Accordingly,  effective August
1, 1996, the Company commenced  accounting for its investment in ART by the cost
method,  and has not  recognized any earnings with respect to ART in the current
quarter.  This  fluctuation  regarding the earnings of ART is the primary reason
for the  decrease  in net  income to  $410,000,  or $0.06 per share in the first
quarter of fiscal 1997 from $792,000,  or $0.12 per share,  in the first quarter
of fiscal 1996.

Revenue

Total  Revenue.  Total  revenue  decreased to $5,657,000 in the first quarter of
fiscal 1997 from $6,678,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 1996.  Following is a
summary of the  components of revenue for the first  quarters of fiscal 1997 and
1996:
 
The above  reported  revenue  amounts  include only the portions  considered  as
commissions earned with respect to sales by ITEX USA, in accordance with

21
 
Section  1200.01 of the AICPA Technical  Practice Aids.  Total sales arranged by
the  Company in  connection  with ITEX USA were  $768,000  and  $903,000  in the
quarters ended November 20, 1996 and October 23, 1995, respectively.

Trade  Exchange  Revenue.  In the first  quarter of fiscal 1997,  the  Company's
revenue from its core retail trade  exchange  business  increased to  $4,761,000
from  $2,164,000  in the first  quarter of fiscal  1996.  The  increase in trade
exchange revenue was  attributable to an array of factors.  The first quarter of
fiscal 1997 was  comprised  of a 16-week  period,  whereas the first  quarter of
fiscal 1996 was  comprised of a 12-week  period.  The Company has  continued its
commitment to improved broker training  programs,  which is having the effect of
increased  rates of new clients  joining as members of the  Exchange  and higher
performance  levels by  brokers.  The Company has also  continued  its  internal
expansion and its ongoing broad-based marketing and advertising program targeted
at recruitment of additional brokers and members of the Exchange.

Corporate Trading Revenue.  The decreased level of corporate trading revenue was
attributable to the Company devoting less of its resources to corporate  trading
activities  during the current year.  Significant  management and staff time was
spent on litigation and other regulatory  matters.  Management expects increases
in operating results from corporate trading activities in future periods.

Costs and Expenses

Costs of Trade Exchange  Revenue.  Costs of trade exchange revenue  increased to
$2,346,000  in the first  quarter  of fiscal  1997  from  $989,000  in the first
quarter of fiscal  1996.  Costs of trade  exchange  revenue,  which  consists of
brokers' fees and  commissions,  were 49% of trade exchange revenue in the first
quarter of fiscal 1997 and 46% in the first quarter of fiscal 1996.

Costs of Corporate Trading.  Costs of corporate trading decreased to $531,000 in
the first quarter of fiscal 1997 from  $3,319,000 in the first quarter of fiscal
1996 because of the lower revenue level. Costs of corporate trading revenue were
68% in the first  quarter of fiscal 1997 and 77% in the first  quarter of fiscal
1996.

Selling,   General   and   Administrative   Expenses.   Selling,   general   and
administrative  expenses  increased to $2,131,000 in the first quarter of fiscal
1997 from  $1,968,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 1996.  Part of the increase
was  attributable  to amortization  expense  related to acquisitions  and higher
professional fees connected with various litigation and regulatory matters.

Total advertising and promotion was $644,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 1997
as  compared  to  $805,000  in the  first  quarter  of fiscal  1996.  One of the
advantages  available to barter  businesses is the ability to fund a significant
portion  of   advertising   costs  using   trade   dollars  or  by  other  trade
consideration.  During  the first  quarter  of fiscal  1997,  the  Company  paid
$630,000  of its  advertising  costs  by  ITEX  trade  dollars  or  other  trade
consideration, representing 98% of total advertising costs for the period.

22
 
Inflation

The  Company's  results of  operations  have not been  affected by inflation and
management  does  not  expect  inflation  to have a  significant  effect  on its
operations in the future.

Forward-Looking Information

From time to time,  the  Company  or its  representatives  have made or may make
forward-looking   statements,   orally  or  in  writing.   Such  forward-looking
statements  may be  included  in,  but not  limited  to,  press  releases,  oral
statements  made with the  approval  of an  authorized  executive  officer or in
various filings made by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Words or phrases "will likely result",  "are expected to", "will continue",  "is
anticipated",  "estimate",  "project or projected",  or similar  expressions are
intended  to  identify  "forward-looking  statements"  within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "Reform Act"). The Company
wishes to ensure that such statements are  accompanied by meaningful  cautionary
statements,  so as to maximize to the fullest extent possible the protections of
the safe harbor established in the Reform Act. Accordingly,  such statements are
qualified in their entirety by reference to and are accompanied by the following
discussion  of certain  important  factors  that could cause  actual  results to
differ materially from such forward-looking statements.

Management is currently  unaware of any trends or  conditions  that could have a
material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, future
results of operations, or liquidity.

However,  investors  should also be aware of factors  that could have a negative
impact on the Company's  prospects and the  consistency of progress in the areas
of revenue  generation,  liquidity,  and generation of capital resources.  These
include:  (i)  variations  in the mix of  corporate  trading and trade  exchange
revenue,  (ii)  possible  inability of the Company to attract  investors for its
equity  securities  or otherwise  raise  adequate  funds from any source,  (iii)
increased governmental regulation of the barter business, (iv) a decrease in the
cash fees and  commissions  realized  by the  Company  based upon a  substantial
decrease in corporate or retail trade exchange transactions, and (v) unfavorable
outcomes to litigation  presently  involving the Company or to which the Company
may become a party in the future.

The risks identified here are not all inclusive. Furthermore,  reference is also
made to other sections of this report that include additional factors that could
adversely impact the Company's business and financial performance. Moreover, the
Company  operates in a very competitive and rapidly  changing  environment.  New
risk factors  emerge from time to time and it is not possible for  Management to
predict all of such risk factors,  nor can it assess the impact of all such risk
factors  on the  Company's  business  or the  extent  to  which  any  factor  or
combination of factors may cause actual results to differ  materially from those
contained  in  any  forward-looking  statements.  Accordingly,   forward-looking
statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results.

                           PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On January 24, 1996,  the Company  acquired a 100% common stock interest in SLI,
Inc. ("SLI"),  a Nevada  corporation now known as IME, Inc., in exchange for the
issuance to SLI's former  shareholders of 60,000 shares of the Company's  common
stock  valued  at  approximately   $645,000.   The  Company  then  made  a  cash
contribution  to the capital of SLI of $1,750,000 and made a loan of $300,000 to
SLI.  Also on January 24, 1996,  SLI  purchased a 50% common  stock  interest in
Business  Exchange  International  Corporation  ("BXI"),  a Nevada  corporation,
pursuant to rights to purchase  such  interest  that had been assigned to SLI by
the former  shareholders  of SLI. SLI paid $1,750,000 for the common interest in
BXI by the  purchase of newly issued  common stock of BXI and, in addition,  SLI
loaned  $300,000 to BXI.  BXI owns and  operates  one of the  leading  organized
barter exchanges in the United States.

On February  12,  1996,  a complaint  was filed on behalf of the Company and its
wholly owned  subsidiary,  SLI, Inc.,  against Saul Yarmak,  Stephen  Friedland,
Business Exchange  International  Corp., BX International,  Inc., Joel Sens, and
David Lawson.  The complaint,  filed in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon
for  Multnomah  County  Case No.  9602-01076,  asserted  claims  for  breach  of
contract,   specific  performance,   declaratory  judgment,  fraud,  defamation,
unlawful trade  practices,  and  interference  with economic  relationships.  It
sought to recover damages for allegedly  disparaging  remarks made by certain of
the  defendants  against  ITEX and for a court  ruling  that SLI  acquired a 50%
interest in the BXI trade exchange owned by one or more of the defendants.

On April 30, 1996, defendants Yarmak, Friedland, Business Exchange International
Corp.,  and BX  International,  Inc.,  filed  an  answer  denying  the  material
allegations and asserting a counterclaim for attorney fees.

On  October  11,  1996,  ITEX  Corporation  moved for  dismissal  of its  claims
(business  defamation,  unlawful trade practices and interference  with economic
relationships),  without prejudice,  against  defendants.  On that same date the
motion  was  granted  and  leave  granted  to file an  Amended  Complaint.  That
complaint  is styled  SLI,  Inc. v. Saul  Yarmak,  Stephen  Friedland,  Business
Exchange  International  Corp. and BX International,  Inc. The Amended Complaint
restates  the  claims  against  defendants  for  breach  of  contract,  specific
performance,  declaratory  judgment and fraud. By dismissing ITEX  Corporation's
claims without  prejudice,  ITEX may, if it chooses,  reinstitute its claims for
business  defamation,  unlawful trade practices and  interference  with economic
relationships.  Proceeding  under the  Amended  Complaint  permits an  expedited
determination of the core contract issues raised,  that is, whether BXI breached
its contract with SLI by asserting  that the BXI Trade  Exchange is not an asset
of BXI. The defendants have asserted counterclaims for attorney's fees and fraud
against SLI in defendants' amended answer and counterclaims.

The  potential  outcome  of this  lawsuit is  uncertain.  However,  the  Company
believes that SLI has meritorious  arguments in favor of its contract  positions
and against defendants' counterclaims. The Company believes that a solution will
be

24
 
reached  either  through  negotiation  or through  completion of the  litigation
process.  The trial date has been set for February 24,  1997.  Legal  counsel is
unable to evaluate the  probability of a favorable or unfavorable  outcome or to
estimate  the  range of  potential  recovery  on the  plaintiff's  claims or any
potential loss on the defendant's counterclaims.

On  September  17,  1996 the Company  filed an action in the  Circuit  Court for
Multnomah   County,   Oregon,   against  Leslie  L.  French  and  Linda  French,
individually   and  dba  AlphaNet  and  AlphaNet,   Inc.,  an  inactive   Oregon
corporation.  The Complaint is for Breach of Contract and Action on Guaranty and
seeks a total of $89,726 on three claims.  On October 2, 1996,  defendants filed
an Answer denying all claims and a Counterclaim alleging malicious  prosecution,
abuse of  process,  invasion  of  privacy  and  libel.  The  counterclaim  seeks
compensatory  and  punitive  damages  of $5.5  million.  A Reply to  defendant's
counterclaims has been filed.

The Company  considers each counterclaim to be totally without merit and expects
each counterclaim to be dismissed.  Both the Company's claims and the defense of
the  counterclaims  is being vigorously  prosecuted by the Company.  As with all
litigation,  the potential  outcome of this lawsuit is uncertain.  However,  the
Company believes that its claims against the defendants are meritorious and that
the  defendants'  counterclaims  are wholly  without merit.  In any event,  this
litigation  does not  present  scenarios  which would be expected to result in a
materially  adverse  effect on the  Company's  financial  position or results of
operations.

On June 28, 1996, the Company  announced in a press release that the Company was
the subject of an informal inquiry from the Securities and Exchange  Commission.
Subsequently,  the Company  received a subpoena  for the  production  of certain
documents  on  September  19,  1996,  pursuant  to a  formal  order  of  private
investigation. The Company is cooperating fully with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

On November  21,  1996,  the  Company  was served with a complaint  filed in the
Circuit Court for  Washington  County,  Oregon,  by William  Bradford  Financial
Services,  Inc.  against  the  Company;  Michael  Baer;  Graham  Norris;  Oxford
Transfer, Inc.; David Christensen,  C.P.A.;  Andersen,  Andersen & Strong, L.C.,
Donovan Snyder, and John Does I-III.  William Bradford Services is controlled by
Leslie  French,  plaintiff in the  litigation  described  above.  The  complaint
alleges  breach  of  fiduciary  duty,  breach  of  contract,  interference  with
contract, and fraud and seeks compensatory and punitive damages.

The Company  considers each of the claims in the complaint to be totally without
merit  and will  vigorously  defend  against  each and every  allegation  of the
complaint.  No answer has yet been filed by the Company. As with all litigation,
the potential outcome of this lawsuit is uncertain.  In any event, however, this
litigation  does not  present  scenarios  which would be expected to result in a
materially  adverse  effect on the  Company's  financial  position or results of
operations.
