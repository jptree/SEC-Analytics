Independent Accountants  Report 

Mellon Bank Premium Finance Loan Master Trust 
c/o Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A., as Trustee:

AFCO Credit Corporation, as Servicer 
AFCO Acceptance Corporation, as Servicer

We have examined the accompanying assertion made by management on AFCO Credit
Corporation s and AFCO Acceptance Corporation s (jointly, AFCO) compliance, as Servicer,
with Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.5 and 8.8 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for the
Mellon Bank Premium Finance Loan Master Trust dated June 15, 2001 and Sections 4.7(a)(i)
and 4.8 of the Supplement (Series 2004-MC) dated as of June 24, 2004 (as amended,
collectively, the Agreements), for the period January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005.
Management is responsible for AFCO s compliance with the aforementioned sections of the
Agreements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about
AFCO s compliance based upon our examination.

Or examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly, included examining,
on a test basis, evidence about AFCO s compliance with the aforementioned sections of
the Agreements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Our examination does not provide a legal determination on AFCO s compliance with the
Agreements.

In our opinion, management s assertion that AFCO was materially in compliance with the
aforementioned sections of the Agreements for the period January 1, 2005 through
December 31, 2005 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

4.7(a)(i) and 4.8 of the Supplement (Series 2004-MC) dated as of June 24, 2004 (as
amended, collectively, the  Agreements ).

Management has performed an evaluation of AFCO s compliance with the aforementioned
sections of the Agreements for the period January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005.
Based upon this evaluation, management believes that, for the period January 1, 2005
through December 31, 2005, AFCO, as Servicer, was materially in compliance with the
