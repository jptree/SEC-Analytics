                                   (UNAUDITED)

NOTE 1     -    BASIS OF PRESENTATION
                ---------------------

                The information in this Form 10-Q Report includes the results of
                operations of Elite  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. and its consolidated
                subsidiaries   (collectively   the   "Company")   including  its
                wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  Elite  Laboratories,  Inc.  ("Elite
                Labs") and Elite Research,  Inc. ("ERI"), for the three and nine
                months ended  December  31, 2005 and  December  31, 2004.  As of
                December 31, 2005, the financial  statements of all entities are
                consolidated  and  all  significant  intercompany  accounts  are
                eliminated  upon  consolidation.   The  accompanying   unaudited
                consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to
                rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
                Accordingly,  they do not  include  all of the  information  and
                footnotes required by accounting  principles  generally accepted
                in  the  United   States  of  America  for  complete   financial
                statements.  In  the  opinion  of  management,  all  adjustments
                (consisting of normal recurring accruals)  considered  necessary
                for a fair presentation of the consolidated  financial position,
                results  of  operations  and cash flows of the  Company  for the
                periods presented have been included.

                The   financial   results  for  the  interim   periods  are  not
                necessarily  indicative  of the results to be  expected  for the
                full year or future interim periods.

                The  accompanying   consolidated  financial  statements  of  the
                Company  have  been  prepared  in  accordance   with  accounting
                principles  generally  accepted for interim financial  statement
                presentation   and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the
                consolidated  financial  statements  and notes  included  in the
                Company's  Annual  Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  March
                31, 2005.  There have been no changes in significant  accounting
                policies since March 31, 2005.

                The Company does not anticipate being profitable for fiscal year
                2006;  therefore  a current  provision  for  income  tax was not
                established  for the three or nine  months  ended  December  31,
                2005. Only the minimum  corporation  tax liability  required for
                state purposes is reflected.

NOTE 2   -      NJEDA REFINANCING
                -----------------

                On  August  31,  2005,  the  Company  successfully  completed  a
                refinancing  through the issuance of the  tax-exempt  bonds (the
                "Bonds") by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (the "
                Authority").   The   refinancing   involved  the   borrowing  of
                $4,155,000  evidenced  by a 6.5% Series A Note in the  principal
                amount of  $3,660,000  maturing  on  September  1, 2030 and a 9%
                Series B Note in the  principal  amount of $495,000  maturing on
                September 1, 2012.  The net proceeds,  after payment of issuance
                costs,  were  or  will be used  (i) to  redeem  the  outstanding
                tax-exempt Bonds originally issued by the Authority on September
                2, 1999,  (ii) refinance  other former  equipment  financing and
                (iii) for the  purchase of certain  equipment  to be used in the
                manufacture of pharmaceutical products.

                Interest is payable  semiannually  on March 1 and September 1 of
                each year. The Bonds are  collateralized  by a first lien on the
                Company's  facility and equipment  acquired with the proceeds of
                the  original  and  refinanced   Bonds.  The  related  Indenture
                requires the maintenance of a $415,500 Debt Service Reserve Fund
                consisting  of  $366,000  from the Series A Bonds  proceeds  and
                $49,500 from the Series B proceeds.  $1,274,311  of the proceeds
                has been  deposited in a short-term  restricted  cash account to
                fund  the  future  purchase  of   manufacturing   equipment  and
                development of the Company's facility.

ELITE PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
             THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004
                                   (UNAUDITED)

NOTE 3   -      STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
                --------------------

                WARRANTS AND OPTIONS
                --------------------

                On November 8, 2005 the Company granted  pursuant to a six month
                service  agreement,  to an investor relations firm non-qualified
                options to purchase 75,000 shares of the Company's  Common Stock
                with an exercise price equal to $2.26 per share, the fair market
                value of a share  of  Common  Stock  at the  date of the  grant,
                vesting pro-rata daily over a six month period. If the agreement
                should be extended  beyond six  months,  the Company is to grant
                another  75,000  non-qualified  options  with an exercise  price
                equal to the then fair market value of a share of Common  Stock,
                which would vest over the service period.

                The per share weighted-average fair value of the above mentioned
                options was $1.70 using the Black-Scholes options pricing model.

                Pursuant to the terms of an Exchange Offer,  the Company sold on
                or before the expiration date of December 31, 2005, an aggregate
                of 735,674  shares of common stock upon the exercise for cash of
                Short Term Warrants for aggregate  gross  proceeds of $1,172,912
                and issued five year Replacement Warrants to purchase at a price
                of $3.00 per share an aggregate  220,705 shares of the Company's
                Common Stock.  The  Placement  Agent  received cash  commissions
                aggregating $76,418 and five-year placement warrants to purchase
                an  aggregate  of 25,473  shares  of common  stock at a price of
                $3.00 per share. The remaining  unexercised Short Term Warrants,
                issued as part of the Private Placement in October 2004, expired
                on December 31, 2005.

                The per share weighted  average of the above mentioned  warrants
                was $1.48 using the Black-Scholes options pricing model with the
                following  weighted  average  assumptions:  no  dividend  yield;
                expected  volatility of 97.84%; risk free interest rate of 4.18%
                and expected lives of 5 years.

                The  value  of  $364,343  on above  warrants  has no  effect  on
                Retained  Earnings or Additional  Paid in Capital  because it is
                reflected as a cost associated with raising capital.

                The Company's  Series B and Series C Stock Purchase  Warrants to
                purchase  2,402,181shares  of Common Stock expired  November 30,
                2005.

                The following  grants were made under the  Company's  2004 Stock
                Option Plan:

                      On July 14,  2005 ten (10) year  options to purchase at an
                      exercise  price of $2.80  per share  (i) to  employees  an
                      aggregate  of 152,200  shares of Common Stock with vesting
                      ranging from immediate to a period of five years from date
                      of grant;  and (ii) to the Chief Financial  Officer 20,000
                      shares of Common Stock vesting over a three-year period.

                      On August 24, 2005 to  employees  ten (10) year options to
                      purchase  in the  aggregate  2,000  shares at an  exercise
                      price of $2.81 vesting over a three year period.

                      The stock  options to  purchase  an  aggregate  of 174,200
                      shares of Common  Stock at prices  ranging  from  $2.80 to
                      $2.81 vest over periods from immediate to five years.  The
                      per share  weighted-average  value of the  options  ranged

                        or  product  sales  transaction  in  which  the  Company
                        receives  an  aggregate  of at least  $5,000,000  in net

                (b)     10,000  options  upon  filing  with  FDA  of  either  an
                        abbreviated new drug application (an "ANDA") or new drug
                        application (an "NDA"); and

                (c)     40,000  options upon  approval by the FDA of any ANDA or
                        NDA for a product not previously approved by the FDA.

                On September 2, 2005,  the Chief  Executive  Officer  waived his
                rights to 75,000 of 300,000  options  granted to him on July 23,
                2003. The Company  determined that the remaining 225,000 options
                are fully vested.

                The  Company,  in  May  2005,  revoked  180,000  of  outstanding

                Stock  Option  Plan  originally  earmarked  to  members  of  the
                abandoned Scientific Advisory Board.

                The Company  took a charge of $618,580 for the nine months ended

                31,  2005),  which  represents  the  fair  value  of the  vested
                options,  utilizing the  Black-Scholes  options pricing model on

                commercialization  of a  controlled  released  generic  drug for

                in the  profits,  if any,  from  the  sales  of the  drug.  This
                agreement  was amended on December 12,  2005,  whereby IPC and a
                Canadian company with marketing and distribution capabilities in
                Canada, have agreed to develop and commercialize the product for
                Canada.   Elite   and  IPC  will   share   their   proceeds   of
                commercialization  in  Canada  on same  terms as in the June 21,
                2005 Agreement.

                the  development  and license of a controlled  released  generic
                anti-infective drug formulated by the Company. The Company is to

                the profits are to be shared equally. Pliva is to make milestone

NOTE 5 -        SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
                -----------------

                On January  4,  2006,  the  Company  received a letter  from the
                American  Stock  Exchange  ("AMEX")  notifying  the Company that
                based on the  Company's  unaudited  financial  statements  as of
                September 30, 2005,  the Company was not in compliance  with the
                continued  listing standards set forth in the AMEX Company Guide
                in that under one  standard  its  shareholders'  equity was less
                than $4,000,000, it had losses from continuing operations and/or
                net losses in three of its four most recent  fiscal  years,  and
                under another  standard its  shareholders'  equity was less than
                $6,000,0000 and it had losses from continuing  operations and/or
                net losses in its five most recent fiscal years.

                The Company  submitted  at AMEX's  request,  a plan  advising of
                action it plans to take to bring the Company in compliance  with
                the above  continued  listing  standards  within a maximum of 18
                months from January 4, 2006.  If the plan is not  accepted,  the
                Company may be subject to delisting  proceedings.  Additionally,
                if the plan is  accepted  but the  Company is not in  compliance
                with the continued  listing  standards or does not make progress
                consistent  with  such plan  during  the plan  period,  AMEX may
                initiate delisting proceedings.

                On  January  10,  2006,  the  Company  entered  into  a  Product
                Development   and   Commercialization    Agreement   with   Orit
                Laboratories  LLC ("ORIT")  providing  that the Company and Orit
                will  co-develop  and  commercialize  an extended  release  drug
                product  for  treatment  of  anxiety,  and  upon  completion  of
                development,  the  possibility  of  licensing  the  product  for
                manufacture  and sale.  The  parties  intend to develop all dose
                strengths  of  the  product.  The  Company  is to  share  in the
                profits,  if any from the  sales  of the  drug.  The term of the
                agreement  is for the  longer of (i) 15 years  from the date the
                product is first commercially sold to a third party, or (ii) the
                life of the  applicable  patent(s),  if any.  The  agreement  is
                automatically  renewable for 3-year periods unless terminated by
                either  party by  providing  the other  party with  twelve  (12)
                months written notice prior to any renewal period.

                In January 2006, the Food and Drug  Administration  accepted the
                Company's  investigational - new drug application for OxyQD(TM),
                its  once-a-day  oxycodone   painkiller.   Under  the  new  drug
                application, the Company will begin its development program with
                an early stage study to evaluate  OxyQD(TM)'s  sustained release
                formation. Currently there is no once-daily oxycodone available,
                however the U.S. market for sustained  release,  twice-daily was
                about $2 billion as of September, 2005.

OVERVIEW

         The Company is a specialty  pharmaceutical  company principally engaged
in the  development  and manufacture of oral  controlled-release  products.  The
Company develops  controlled  release products using proprietary  technology and
licenses these products.  The Company's  strategy  includes  developing  generic
versions of  controlled  release drug  products  with high barriers to entry and
assisting  partner companies in the life cycle management of products to improve
off-patent  drug  products.  The  Company's  technology is applicable to develop
delayed, sustained or targeted release pellets, capsules,  tablets, granules and
powders.  The Company has one product  currently being sold  commercially  and a
pipeline of eight drug products under  development in the therapeutic areas that
include cardiovascular,  pain management, allergy and infection. The addressable
market for the  Company's  pipeline  of  products  exceeds  $4.25  billion.  The
Company's  current  facility  in  Northvale,  New  Jersey  also is a GMP and DEA
registered facility for research, development, and manufacturing.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

         Management's  discussion addresses the Company's consolidated financial
statements,  which have been prepared in accordance with  accounting  principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America.  The  preparation  of these
financial  statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities,  the  disclosure  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of financial  statements and the
reported  amounts of revenues and expenses  during the reporting  period.  On an
ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgment,  including those
related to long-lived  assets,  intangible  assets,  income taxes,  equity-based
compensation,  and contingencies and litigation.  Management bases its estimates
and  judgments on  historical  experience  and on various other factors that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making  judgments  about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

      THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 (UNAUDITED)

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES (Continued)

         Management believes the following critical accounting  policies,  among
others,  affect  its  more  significant  judgments  and  estimates  used  in the
preparation of its consolidated financial statements.

         The Company's most critical accounting policies include the recognition
of revenue upon  completion  of certain  phases of projects  under  research and
development  contracts.  Revenues  from  these  contracts  are  recognized  when
management determines the Company has completed its obligation under each phase.
The Company  also  assesses a need for an  allowance  to reduce its deferred tax
assets to the amount that it believes  are more likely than not to be  realized.
Management  estimates its net operating  losses will probably not be utilized in
the near future,  and has not  recognized  a tax benefit from this  deferred tax
asset. If management anticipated being profitable,  a deferred tax benefit would
be  recognized  and such  estimate  would reduce net loss and net loss per share
accordingly.  The Company assesses the  recoverability  of long-lived assets and
intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances  indicate that the
carrying value of the assets may not be  recoverable.  Management  estimates the
Company's  patents and property and equipment are not impaired.  If these assets
were considered  impaired,  the Company would recognize an impairment loss which
would  increase the  Company's net loss and net loss per share  accordingly.  It
should be noted that  actual  results  may differ  from  these  estimates  under
different assumptions or conditions.

         During the fiscal year ended  March 31,  2003,  the Company  elected to
prospectively recognize the fair value of stock options granted to employees and
members of the Board of  Directors,  effective as of the beginning of the fiscal
year. The prospective method allowed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
affects the Company's results of operations for the three and nine month periods
ended  December  31, 2005 and 2004 as options  were  granted or repriced  during
these periods which either vested  immediately or vest over three to five years.
The Company does not know the future effect of options and warrants which may be
granted to  employees  and  members  of the Board of  Directors.  The  Financial
Accounting   Standards  Board  provided  three   transition   alternatives   for
recognizing  stock-based  compensation  cost  using the fair  value  method.  If
management did not elect the prospective  method during the three and nine-month
periods ended  December 31, 2005 and 2004, net loss and net loss per share would
have been reduced.  However,  the two other  methods would have required  either
greater  compensation  cost  to be  recognized  as  an  expense  or  retroactive
restatement of previously reported net loss.

RESULTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS

THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 2004

         Revenues consisted of royalties of $15,635,  for the three months ended
December  31, 2005.  There were no reported  revenues for the three months ended
December 31, 2004.

         General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December
31, 2005 were $379,893,  a decrease of $245,430,  or approximately  39.2%,  from
$625,323  for  the  comparable  period  of the  prior  year.  The  decrease  was
substantially  due to reductions in bad debt expense of $153,250 and  consulting
and  legal  fees  approximating  $90,000,  partially  offset by an  increase  of
allocated salaries of $10,000.

         Research and development  costs for the three months ended December 31,
2005 were  $1,124,581,  an increase of $398,406,  or approximately  54.9%,  from
$726,175 for the  comparable  period of the prior year,  primarily the result of
increases in wages, raw materials,  laboratory and manufacturing  supplies.  The
costs associated with the manufacturing of batches of Lodrane 24(R) and the work
completed  on newly  signed  development  agreements  have  contributed  to this
increase.

RESULTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS (Continued)

THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 (Continued)

         We are unable to provide a break-down of the specific costs  associated
with the research and development of each product on which we devoted  resources
because  a  significant  portion  of the  costs are  generally  associated  with
salaries,  laboratory supplies, laboratory and manufacturing expenses, utilities
and similar expenses.  We have not historically  allocated these expenses to any
particular  product.  In addition,  we cannot estimate the additional  costs and
expenses that may be incurred in order to potentially  complete the  development
of any product, nor can we estimate the amount of time that might be involved in
such development because of the uncertainties associated with the development of
controlled release drug delivery products as described in this report.

         Depreciation  and  amortization for the three months ended December 31,
2005  increased  by  $51,090  to  $96,450  from  $45,360  for the  year  earlier
comparable  period due to the full  write-off  of  financing  costs of  $124,212
associated with the redemption of the tax exempt Bonds (the "Bonds")  originally
issued by the  Authority  on  September  2,  1999,  offset by the  reduction  in
amortization and depreciation of certain assets which had been fully depreciated
and amortized.

         Other  expenses, net for the three months ended  December 31, 2005 were
$116,232,  an increase of $227,674,  or approximately 20.5%, from the comparable
period of the prior  year.  The  increase  was  primarily  due to an increase of
$242,321 in charges  related to issuance of stock options.  Additional  interest
income, due to higher compensating balances as a result of the private placement
and EDA refinancing, was somewhat offset by increased interest expense resulting
from the equipment financing.

         As a result  of the  foregoing,  the  Company's  net loss for the three
months ended December 31, 2005 increased  32.4% to $1,701,521  from the net loss
of $1,285,416 for the comparable period of the prior year.

NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 2004

         The Company's revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2005 were
$402,578, consisting of manufacturing fees of $369,173 and royalties of $33,405.
Revenues for the nine months ended  December  31, 2004 were  $151,450,  of which
$150,000 was a non-refundable  payment received from Purdue Pharma L.P. granting
it the right to evaluate certain abuse resistance drug formulation technology of
the Company.

         General and administrative  expenses for the nine months ended December
31, 2005 were  $1,241,108,  a decrease  of  $433,933  or 25.9% as compared  with
$1,675,041  for  the  same  period  of  the  prior  year,  substantially  due to
reductions in amounts paid and accrued in settlements  of  litigation,  bad debt
write-offs and legal fees partially  offset by modest  increases in salaries and
accounting fees.

         Research and  development  costs for the nine months ended December 31,
2005  were  $2,862,908,  an  increase  of  $925,114,  or  47.7% as  compared  to
$1,937,794  for the same  period  of the prior  year,  primarily  the  result of
increased  wages,  laboratory  and  manufacturing  supplies  and raw  materials,
largely due to the manufacture of commercial batches of Lodrane 24(R).

         Other  expenses,  net for the nine months ended  December 31, 2005 were
$540,549, a decrease of $375,813,  or 41.0% as compared to $916,362 for the same
period of the prior year,  due primarily to a reduction  during the current year
of $344,720  in  non-cash  compensation  through  issuance of stock  options and
warrants,  and a charge of $397,732  during the nine months  ended  December 31,
2004 related to repricing of stock options.  Additional  interest income was due
to higher  compensating  balances  as a result of a  private  placement  and EDA
refinancing,  somewhat offset by an increase in interest expense  resulting from
the equipment financing.

         The Company's net loss for the nine months ended  December 31, 2005 was
$4,648,549  compared to $4,649,827 for the comparable  period of the prior year.
Increases  in  revenues  and  decreases  in  general,  administrative  and other
expenses  net for the nine  months  ended  December  31,  2005  were  offset  by
increases in research and development.

MATERIAL CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION

         The Company's  working capital (total current assets less total current
liabilities),  decreased to $1,968,499  December 31, 2005 from  $3,328,583 as of
March  31,  2005,  primarily  due to the  use of  cash in  funding  net  loss of
$4,107,000 from operations.

         The  Company   experienced   negative  cash  flow  from  operations  of
$3,246,283  for the nine months ended  December 31, 2005,  primarily  due to the
Company's  net  loss  from  operations  due  to  an  increase  in  research  and
development activities as to the drug products in its pipeline

         On November 15, 2004,  Elite's  partner,  ECR,  launched Lodrane 24(R),
once a day allergy product,  utilizing  Elite's  extended release  technology to
provide for once daily dosing.  Under its agreement with ECR, Elite is currently
manufacturing  commercial batches of Lodrane 24(R) in exchange for manufacturing
margin and  royalties on product  revenues.  Royalty  income earned for the nine
months  ended  December 31, 2005 was $33,405.  The Company  expects  future cash
flows from royalties to provide additional cash to help fund its operations.

         On March 30, 2005,  the Company  entered  into a product,  development,
manufacturing  and  distribution  agreement  with  Harris  Pharmaceutical,  Inc.
("Harris")  and Tish  Technologies  LLC  ("Tish")  with  respect to a controlled
release generic  anti-infective  drug. The product is a generic  equivalent to a
branded drug which the Company  estimates  has  addressable  market  revenues of
approximately  $80  million  per  year.  The  agreement  provides  for  (1)  the
development of the drug by Elite with costs of development to be shared by Elite
and Harris, (2) the manufacture by Elite and its sale to Harris for distribution
and (3) Tish to be responsible for any requisite submissions to the FDA relating
to the product.  Elite is to share in the profits generated from the sale of the
product.

         On June 21, 2005, the Company and  IntelliPharmaCeutics  Corp. ("IPC"),
entered  into  an  agreement  for the  development  and  commercialization  of a
controlled  released  generic  drug for certain  anti-infective  diseases by the
parties. The Company estimates that the product had an addressable market in the
U.S.  of  approximately  $4  billion  in 2004.  The  Company  is to share in the
profits, if any, from the sales of the drug. On December 12, 2005, the agreement
was  amended  with  respect  to the  development  and  commercialization  of the
controlled  release drug product in Canada.  Since IPC intended to enter into an
agreement with a Canadian company with respect to the development,  distribution
and sale of the drug  product in Canada,  the  parties  agreed to suspend  their
obligations   under  the  agreement   with  respect  to  the   development   and
commercialization  of the controlled  release drug product in Canada. IPC agreed
to pay the Company a certain  percentage  of any  payments  received by IPC with
respect the  commercialization  of the  controlled  release drug product by such
Canadian company.

         On June 22, 2005, the Company and Pliva, Inc.  ("Pliva") entered into a
Product  Development  and License  Agreement  providing for the  development and
license of a controlled  released generic  anti-infective drug formulated by the
Company.  The  Company  is to  manufacture  and Pliva  will  market and sell the
product.  Under the agreement,  the partner is to make milestone payments to the
Company.  The  development  costs are to be paid both by Pliva and the  Company,
they have agreed to share the profits equally.

         No  assurance  can be given  that  any of the  above  products  will be
successfully  developed  or that  individually  or in the  aggregate  they  will
generate any material revenues for the Company.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         For the nine months ended  December 31, 2005,  the Company  experienced
negative cash flow and financed its operations  primarily through utilization of
its existing cash. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had  approximately  $1.6
million of cash and cash equivalents,  a decrease of approximately  $3.0 million
from  the  $4.6  million  at  December  31,  2004  and had  working  capital  of
approximately  $2.0  million.  At December  31,  2004,  the Company had recently
consummated its private placement of Series A Preferred Stock,  raising net cash
of $5,866,000.

         Net cash used in operating  activities was  $3,246,283  during the nine
months ended December 31, 2005, compared to $3,610,066 for the nine months ended
December 31, 2004. Net cash used in operating  activities during the nine months
ended  December  31, 2005  included the  Company's  net loss of  $4,648,549  and
increases  in  prepaid  expenses  and other  current  assets,  offset in part by
non-cash   charges  of  $618,580  in  stock  option   charges  and  $405,562  in
depreciation and  amortization  expense.  Net cash used in operating  activities
during the nine months ended  December 31, 2004  included the Company's net loss
of $4,649,827 offset in part by non-cash charges of $964,300 in stock option and
warrant charges and $271,080 in depreciation and amortization expense.

         Investing activities used net cash of $1,482,011 during the nine months
ended December 31, 2005, which resulted primarily from an increase in restricted
cash requirements as a result of the EDA refinancing.

         During the nine months ended  December 31, 2005,  financing  activities
provided net cash of $2,474,482 derived from net proceeds of $1,292,995 from the
exercise of stock options and warrants and  $1,455,548  from the  refinancing of
Bonds , offset by $274,061  used to repay  indebtedness.  During the nine months
ended December 31, 2004,  financing  activities  provided net cash of $5,866,000
derived from private  placement of Series A Preferred Stock. For the nine months
ended December 31, 2004, $439,989 was used to repay indebtedness.

         The  Company's  capital  expenditures  were $205,625 in the nine months
ended  December  31, 2005 as  compared  to  $427,499  in the nine  months  ended
December 31, 2004, the latter financed through an equipment loan.

         As of December  31, 2005 the Company had cash and cash  equivalents  of
approximately  $1.6  million.  The  Company  anticipates  that such  position is
adequate  to  finance  its  operations  through  June 30,  2006  but  thereafter
additional  financing  may be required,  particularly  in view of the  Company's
expenditures  required for the further development and  commercialization of its
products.  The Company has no current  arrangements  with respect to  additional
financings.  The Company  intends to seek  additional  funds through the sale of
additional  debt or equity,  however no assurance  can be given that the Company
will be able to obtain the required additional  financing or if obtained it will
be on favorable terms. The Company's  inability to obtain  additional  financing
when needed  would  impair its ability to meet its  business  objectives.  Other
possible  sources for such  additional  financings are the cash exercises of the
Long Term Warrants issued in the October 2004 private placement, the Replacement
Warrants  issued in the December 2005 private  placement and other  warrants and
options that are currently outstanding.

         The Company had  outstanding,  as of December  31,  2005,  bonds in the
aggregate  amount of  $4,155,000,  consisting  of  $3,660,000 of 6.5% tax exempt
Bonds with an outside  maturing of  September  1, 2030 and  $495,000 of 9% Bonds
with an outside  maturity of September 1, 2012. The bonds are secured by a first
lien on the Company's facility in Northvale,  New Jersey.  Pursuant to the terms
of the bonds,  several  restricted  cash accounts have been  established for the
payment of bond  principal  and  interest.  Bond  proceeds were utilized for the
redemption  of  previously  issued tax exempt bonds  issued by the  Authority in
September  1999  and to  refinance  equipment  financing,  as  well  as  provide
approximately $1,000,000 of capital for the purchase of additional equipment for
the  manufacture  and  development at the Company's  facility of  pharmaceutical
products and the  maintenance  of a $415,500  debt service  reserve.  All of the
restricted cash, other than the debt service reserve, is expected to be expended
within twelve months ended  December 31, 2006 and is therefore  categorized as a
current  asset on the  Company's  consolidated  balance sheet as of December 31,
2005. Pursuant to the terms of the related bond indenture agreement, the Company
is required to observe certain  covenants,  including  covenants relating to the
incurrence of additional indebtedness, the granting of liens

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Continued)

and the maintenance of certain financial covenants. As of December 31, 2005, the
Company was in compliance with the bond covenants.

         On July 8, 2004, Elite Labs entered into a loan and financing agreement
to finance the purchase of certain machinery and equipment.  Elite Labs borrowed
$400,000 payable in 36 monthly installments of $13,671 each, including principal
and  interest  at 14% per annum.  The first  four and the last  three  months of
scheduled payments are held by the lender to be applied to the principal balance
when due. The loan is secured by two pieces of equipment and the guaranty of the
Company.  In addition,  the Company  issued to  designees  of the lender  50,000
warrants,  which vested immediately,  to purchase 50,000 shares of the Company's
Common  Stock at $4.20 per share.  The cost of $41,252  for these  warrants  was
charged  in  the  nine  months  ended  December  31,  2004.  Proceeds  from  the
refinancing of the Company's EDA Bonds were used to pay-off this loan.

         The  Company  from  time  to time  will  consider  potential  strategic
transactions  including  acquisitions,  strategic alliances,  joint ventures and
licensing arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies. The Company retained
an investment banking firm to assist with its efforts. There can be no assurance
that any such transaction will be available or consummated.

         As of December 31, 2005,  the Company's  principal  source of liquidity
was approximately $1,648,191 of cash and cash equivalents.  The Company also may
receive funds through the exercise of outstanding  stock options and warrants in
addition to funds that may be generated  from the  potential  sale of New Jersey
tax losses.  There can be no assurance that proceeds from the sale of tax losses
and from the  exercise,  if any,  of  outstanding  warrants  or options  will be
material.

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

         The Company had no investments in marketable  securities as of December
31, 2005 or assets and  liabilities  which are  denominated  in a currency other
than U.S. dollars or involve commodity price risks.

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

         As of the  end of the  period  covered  by  this  report,  based  on an
evaluation of the Company's  disclosure  controls and  procedures (as defined in
Rules  13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934),  the
Chief  Executive and Chief Financial  Officer of the Company  concluded that the
Company's  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  are  effective  to ensure that
information  required to be disclosed by the Company in its Exchange Act reports
is recorded,  processed,  summarized  and reported  within the  applicable  time
periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms.

         There was no change in the Company's  internal  controls over financial
reporting  that occurred  during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2005 that
materially  affected or is reasonably  likely to materially affect the Company's
internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

In addition to the Risk Factors set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended March 31,  2005,  stockholder  and  potential  investors
should  consider the following in evaluating an investment in the Company and in
analyzing the Company's forward looking statements:

THE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE  LISTING OF THE COMMON STOCK
WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL  ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET FOR THE COMMON STOCK AND ITS
MARKET PRICE.

         On January 4, 2006,  the Company  received a letter  from the  American
Stock  Exchange  ("AMEX")  notifying  it that based on the  Company's  unaudited
financial  statements as of September 30, 2005, the Company is not in compliance
with the continued listing standards set forth in the AMEX Company Guide in that
under one listing standard its shareholders'  equity is less than $4,000,000 and
it had losses from continuing  operations and/or net losses in three of its four
most recent fiscal years and under another  listing  standard its  shareholders'
equity is less than  $6,000,000  and it had losses  from  continuing  operations
and/or net losses in its five most recent  fiscal  years.  The  Company,  at the
request of AMEX, submitted a plan on February 3, 2006 advising AMEX of action it
has taken,  and will take, to bring it in compliance with the continued  listing
standards within a maximum of 18 months from January 4, 2006.  However,  if AMEX
does not accept the plan,  the Company may be subject to delisting  proceedings.
Additionally,  if a plan is accepted but the Company is not in  compliance  with
the continued listing  standards or does not make progress  consistent with such
plan during the plan period, AMEX may then initiate delisting  proceedings.  The
failure to  maintain  listing  of the Common  Stock on AMEX will have an adverse
effect on the market and the market price for the Common Stock.

IF THE  COMPANY  IS  UNABLE  TO  OBTAIN  ADDITIONAL  FINANCING  NEEDED  FOR  THE
EXPENDITURES  FOR THE  DEVELOPMENT AND  COMMERCIALIZATION  OF THE COMPANY'S DRUG
PRODUCTS, IT WOULD IMPAIR THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS BUSINESS OBJECTIVES.

         As of December  31,  2005,  the  Company had cash and cash  equivalents
aggregate approximately $1.6 million. The Company anticipates that such position
as of December 31, 2005 is adequate to finance its  operations  through June 30,
2006 but  thereafter,  the Company will require  additional  financing to insure
that  the  Company  will be  able  to  meet  the  expenditures  to  develop  and
commercialize  its products  for which the Company has no current  arrangements.
The Company intends to seek additional funds through the sale of additional debt
or equity. No representation can be made that the Company will be able to obtain
additional financing or if obtained it will be on favorable terms, or at all. No
assurance  can be given that any  offering if  undertaken  will be  successfully
concluded or that if  concluded  the proceeds  will be material.  The  Company's
inability to obtain additional financing when needed would impair its ability to
meet its business objectives. Other possible sources of the additional financing
are the cash  exercises  of the Long Term  Warrants  issued in the October  2004
private placement,  the Replacement Warrants issued in the December 2005 private
placement and other warrants and options that are currently outstanding.

         If any future  financing  involves  the further  sale of the  Company's
securities,   the  Company's   then-existing   stockholders'   equity  could  be
substantially  diluted.  On the other hand, if the Company  incurred  debt,  the
Company would be subject to risks  associated with  indebtedness,  including the
risk that interest rates might  fluctuate and cash flow would be insufficient to
pay principal and interest on such indebtedness.

ITEM 2.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

         On November 8, 2005,  the Company  entered  into a six month  agreement
with an investor relations firm to provide investor relation services including,
but not limited to, overall management of the Company's corporate communications
program,  securing group  appointments,  assistance with mass targeted mailings,
compiling  promotional  materials,  editing news  releases  and other  corporate
functions.  As part of the  compensation,  the Company  granted  the  consultant
non-qualified  options to purchase 75,000 shares of the Company's  Common Stock,
vesting  pro-rata  over a six  month  period at an  exercise  price of $2.26 per
share,  equal to the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of
the grant. If the agreement should be extended beyond six months, the Company is
to grant another  75,000  non-qualified  options with an exercise price equal to
the then fair market value of a share of Common Stock, which would vest over the
service period.

                                  CERTIFICATION

        I, Bernard Berk, certify that:

        1.      I have  reviewed  this  Quarterly  Report  on Form  10-Q for the
                quarter ended December 31, 2005 of Elite  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.
                (the "registrant");

        2.      Based on my  knowledge,  this report does not contain any untrue
                statement  of a material  fact or omit to state a material  fact
                necessary  to  make  the  statements   made,  in  light  of  the
                circumstances   under  which  such  statements  were  made,  not
                misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

        3.      Based on my  knowledge,  the  financial  statements,  and  other
                financial information included in this report, fairly present in
                all  material  respects  the  financial  condition,  results  of
                operations  and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the
                periods presented in this report;

        4.      The registrant's  other certifying officer and I are responsible
                for  establishing  and  maintaining   disclosure   controls  and
                procedures  (as  defined in  Exchange  Act Rules  13a-15(e)  and
                15d-15(e)) for the registrant and have:

                (a)     Designed such  disclosure  controls and  procedures,  or
                        caused such  disclosure  controls and  procedures  to be

                        reasonable   assurance   regarding  the  reliability  of
                        financial  reporting  and the  preparation  of financial
                        statements  for  external  purposes in  accordance  with

                        and

                (d)     Disclosed in this report any change in the  registrant's
                        internal control over financial  reporting that occurred
                        during the registrant's  most recent fiscal quarter that
                        has  materially  affected,  or is  reasonably  likely to
                        materially  affect,  the  registrant's  internal control
                        over financial reporting.

        5.      The registrant's  other certifying officer and I have disclosed,
                based on our most recent  evaluation  of internal  control  over
                financial reporting,  to the registrant's auditors and the audit

                        financial  reporting  which  are  reasonably  likely  to
                        adversely  affect  the  registrant's  ability to record,
                        process, summarize and report financial information; and

                (b)     Any  fraud,  whether  or  not  material,  that  involves
                        management  or other  employees  who have a  significant
                        role in the registrant's internal control over financial
                        reporting.
