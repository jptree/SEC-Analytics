Part I 

Item 1. Business 

Bay View Deposit Corporation, or  BVDC , a wholly owned subsidiary of Bay View Acceptance
Corporation ( BVAC ) which in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bay View Capital Corporation
(the  Company ), is a Delaware Corporation formed for the sole purpose of issuing asset-backed
securities through trusts. At December 31, 2005, BVDC had three active trusts: (1) the Bay View
2005-LJ-1 Owner Trust, (2) the Bay View 2005-LJ-2 Owner Trust and (3) the Bay View 2005-3 Owner
Trust, or collectively the  Trusts . The only  business  of the Trusts is the collection and
distribution of payments on the motor vehicle receivables in the manner described in the
Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-121380). Accordingly, there is no relevant
information to report in response to Item 101 of Regulation S-K.

Item 2. Properties 

BVDC and the Trusts do not have any physical properties. Accordingly, this item is
inapplicable.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings 

There were no material legal proceedings involving BVDC, the Trusts, or, any certificates
involving the Trustees which were pending at December 31, 2005, or as of the date of this report.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders 

No votes or consents of certificate-holders were solicited during fiscal year 2005 for any
purpose.

Item 5. Market for the Registrant s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters 

There is no established public trading market for the certificates.

As of December 31, 2005, there were 30 registered certificate-holders of the Bay View
2005-LJ-1 Trust, 31 registered certificate-holders of the Bay View 2005-LJ-2 Trust and 42
registered certificate-holders of the Bay View 2005-3 Trust. Because the Trusts pay no dividends
with respect to the certificates, the information required by Item 201 of Regulation S-K regarding
dividends is inapplicable to the Trusts.

Item 6. Selected Financial Data 

No financial data is required of BVDC, as Registrant, in as much as the Registration Statement
on Form S-3 (File No. 333-121380) was filed for and on behalf of the Trusts and, furthermore,
because BVDC is not a guarantor of any of the payments due from the Trusts to certificate-holders.

The regular monthly report forms, which the Trustees are required to include with each monthly
distribution of the Trusts  assets to certificate-holders, set forth for the prior calendar month,
as well as cumulatively, all of the relevant financial information required by the applicable
Indentures to be reported to certificate-holders.

The Trusts  Monthly Servicer s Certificate Reports, referred to as the  Monthly Reports , for
the months ended February 28, 2005 through December 31, 2005 have been previously filed as
indicated at Part IV. Item 15.  Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules and Reports on Form 8-K. 

The foregoing presents all relevant financial information relating to the Trusts. Because of
the limited business activity of the Trusts, the Selected Financial Data specified in Item 301 of
Regulation S-K would not provide any meaningful additional information.

Table of Contents   

Part II 

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Because of the limited business activity of the Trusts, the presentation of Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as otherwise required by
Item 303 of Regulation S-K, would not be meaningful. All relevant information is contained in the
Monthly Reports (filed under Current Reports on Form 8-K) as described above.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Because of the limited business activity of the Trusts, the presentation of Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, as required by Item 305 of Regulation S-K, would not be
meaningful. All relevant information is contained in the Monthly Reports (filed under Current
Reports on Form 8-K) as described above.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 

As discussed above, furnishing the financial information required by Item 8 of Form 10-K would
not add any relevant information to that provided by the foregoing statements. Because the
certificates are essentially  pass-through  securities, the Trusts will have  income  only in the
limited sense of collecting payments on the motor vehicle receivables. The only material items of
 expense  for the Trusts will be the amounts paid as servicing compensation and potentially certain
payments relating to any credit enhancement facilities. The Monthly Reports contained in the
Current Reports on Form 8-K provide complete information on the amounts of the  income  and
 expenses  of the Trusts.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 

Not Applicable.

Part III 

Item 10. Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant 

Not applicable.

Item 11. Executive Compensation 

Not applicable.

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management 

As of December 31, 2005, there were 30 registered certificate-holders of the Bay View
2005-LJ-1 Trust, 31 registered certificate-holders of the Bay View 2005-LJ-2 Trust and 42
registered certificate-holders of the Bay View 2005-3 Trust, all of whom maintained their security
positions with the Depository Trust Company. While some of these certificate-holders  security
positions in the Trusts exceeded 5% of the outstanding certificate balance, such securities do not
constitute voting securities within the meaning of Item 403 of Regulation S-K.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 

BVDC received payments from the Trusts in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Indenture.

     I am responsible for reviewing the activities performed by the servicer under the trust

agreements, and except as disclosed in the report, the servicer has fulfilled its
obligations under the trust and servicing agreements; and 

5. 
       
     These reports disclose all significant deficiencies relating to the servicer s
compliance with the minimum servicing standards based upon the report provided by an

 INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT

EXHIBIT 99.2  

Report of Independent Accountants on Compliance   
  with Minimum Servicing Standards  

To the Board of Directors of 
Bay View Acceptance Corporation

We have examined management s assertion about Bay View Acceptance Corporation (the  Company )
compliance as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 with its established minimum servicing
standards described in the accompanying Management s Assertion (see Exhibit I). Management is
responsible for the Company s compliance with those minimum servicing standards. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance
based on our examination.

Our examination was made in accordance with attestation standards established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis,
evidence about the Company s compliance with its minimum servicing standards and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal
determination on the Company s compliance with its minimum servicing standards.

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned minimum
servicing standards as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 is fairly stated, in all
material respects based on the criteria set forth in Appendix I.
