NOTE
                1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Basis
                of Presentation  

The
                accompanying interim period financial statements of Universal Capital
                Management, Inc. (the  Company ) are unaudited pursuant to certain rules
                and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and include,
                in
                the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of only normal
                recurring accruals) necessary for a fair statement of the results
                for the
                periods indicated. Such results, however, are not necessarily indicative
                of results that may be expected for the full year. Certain information
                and
                footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements
                prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
                in
                the United States have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such
                rules
                and regulations. The financial statements should be read in conjunction
                with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s
                Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2005
                as
                filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Nature
                of Business  

The
                Company is a newly organized (inception date of August 16, 2004),
                closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has
                elected
                to be treated as a business development company under the Investment
                Company Act of 1940. The Company is primarily engaged in the business
                of
                furnishing capital and making available managerial assistance to
                companies
                that do not have ready access to capital through conventional channels.
                The Company refers to companies in which it invests as  portfolio
                companies.  

Security
                Valuations  

Investments
                in securities traded on a national securities exchange (or reported
                on the
                Nasdaq National Market) are stated at the last reported sales price
                on the
                day of valuation; other securities traded in the over-the-counter
                market
                (such as OTC BB, Pink Sheets, etc.) and listed securities for which
                no
                sale was reported on that date are stated at the last quoted bid
                price.
                Restricted securities and other securities (small, privately held
                companies) for which quotations are not readily available are valued
                at
                fair value as determined by the board of directors. 

Investment
                securities are exposed to various risks, such as overall market
                volatility. Due to the level of risk associated with the securities
                of
                certain portfolio companies, it is likely that changes in their values
                will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially
                affect
                the amounts reported in the statement of assets and liabilities at
                future
                dates. 

Use
                of Estimates  

The
                preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
                accepted
                accounting principles in the United States requires management to
                make
                estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
                and
                liabilities and disclosure on contingent assets and liabilities at
                the
                date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
                and
                expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ
                from
                those estimates.  

Cash
                and Equivalents  

For
                purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, the Company considers all
                investment instruments purchased with a maturity of three months
                or less
                to be cash and cash equivalents.

                1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,
                CONTINUED  

Property
                and Equipment  

Property
                and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
                For
                financial accounting purposes, depreciation is generally computed
                by the
                straight-line method over the following useful lives: 

Furniture
                and fixtures 5 to 7 years 

Computer
                and office equipment 3 to 7 years 

Income
                Taxes  

Deferred
                tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences
                between
                the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that
                will
                result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted
                tax
                laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences
                are
                expected to affect taxable income. Deferred income taxes arise principally
                from the recognition of unrealized gains or losses from appreciation
                in
                investment value for financial statement purposes, while for income
                tax
                purposes, gains or losses are only recognized when realized (i.e.,
                on
                disposition). When unrealized gains and losses result in a net unrealized
                loss, provision is made for a deferred tax asset. When unrealized
                gains
                and losses result in a net unrealized gain, provision is made for
                a
                deferred tax liability. Valuation allowances are established when
                necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to
                be
                realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for
                the
                period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax
                assets
                or liabilities.  

Concentrations
                of Credit Risk  

Financial
                instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations
                of
                credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents. At times, the Company s
                balances with financial institutions may exceed the insured amount
                provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 

Recently
                issued Accounting Pronouncements  

In
                December 2004, the FASB revised SFAS 123,     Accounting
                for Stock-Based Compensation    
                to require all companies to expense the fair value of employee stock
                options. SFAS 123R is effective at the beginning of the next fiscal
                year
                that begins after December 15, 2005 for a small business
                issuer.

NOTE
                3 - INCOME TAXES  

As
                an investment company organized as a corporation, the Company is
                taxable
                as a corporation. As discussed  in
                Note 1, the Company utilizes the assets and liability method of accounting
                for income taxes in accordance  with
                Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (SFAS
                109).   

The
                deferred income tax benefit consists of the following:

The
                effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory federal income
                tax rate

Deferred
                income taxes reflect the net effect of unrealized gains on investments
                and
                an operating loss carryforward. 

There
                are no other significant temporary differences between the carrying
                amount
                of assets and liabilities for  

financial
                reporting purposes and the amount used for income tax
                purposes.

        per share. The warrants expire on December 15, 2006.          

In
        order
        to pay for the securities subscribed, the Company signed a promissory note
        payable to BroadRelay   Holdings,
        Inc. in the amount of $100,000. Interest shall accrue at the prime rate of
        interest. Principal and   Accrued

        of
        interest was 7.50% at   January
        31, 2006.                      

NOTE
        6 - CAPITAL SHARE TRANSACTIONS                    

During
        the nine months ended January 31, 2006, 321,759 shares of common stock of
        the
        Company were   issued
        for proceeds of $559,915.        On
        January 31, 2006 pursuant to a Share Contribution Agreement, David Bovi and
        William Colucci contributed   200,000
        and 150,000 shares of common stock of the Company, respectively, to the

        with
        the Company were   contributed
        to the Company without further consideration being received by either
        party. 

NOTE
        7 - BAD DEBT                    

On
        January 31, 2006, the Company determined a Note Receivable from IPI Fundraising
        Inc, in the amount of   $19,350
        to be uncollectible. The note was written off directly to bad debt expense.
        The
        Company believes   that
        all
        other receivable balances at January 31, 2006 are fully collectible and no

      Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The
      following discussion contains forward-looking statements. The words
 anticipate,   believe,   expect,   plan,   intend,   estimate,   project, 
 will,   could,   may  and similar expressions are intended to identify
      forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the Company s current views
      with respect to future events and financial performance and involve risks and
      uncertainties. Should one or more risks or uncertainties occur, or should
      underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially
      and
      adversely from those anticipated, believed, expected, planned, intended,
      estimated, projected or otherwise indicated. Readers should not place undue
      reliance on these forward-looking statements.  

The
      following discussion is qualified by reference to, and should be read in
      conjunction with the Company s financial statements and the notes thereto, and
      the Management s Discussion and Analysis section for the fiscal year ended April
      30, 2005 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K 

Business
      Overview  

The
      Company s primary business is to invest in emerging growth companies. The
      Company intends to assist these companies in strategic and financial planning,
      in market strategies and to assist them in trying to achieve prudent and
      profitable growth. Management is devoting most of its efforts to general
      business planning, raising capital, and seeking appropriate investments.

The
      Company s primary investment objective is to increase its net assets by adding
      value to the portfolio companies and thus, to shareholder value. Management
      believes that the Company will be able to achieve these objectives by
      concentrating on investments in companies which are most likely to benefit
      from
      management s expertise in finance, strategic planning, operations, and
      technology. 

The
      income that the Company derives from investments in portfolio companies consists
      of management fees, interest income, and appreciation (net of depreciation)
      in
      the values of portfolio companies. At the time of disposition, the disposition
      proceeds of these securities of portfolio companies will most likely make up
      most of the Company s revenues. Consequently, the Company s success or failure
      will depend on investing in portfolio companies the securities of which
      appreciate in value more than the sum of Company operating expenses and the
      amount by which portfolio company securities depreciate in value. There is
      no
      assurance that the Company will be able to do so. 

Pursuant
      to the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the
      Board
      of Directors is responsible for determining in good faith the fair value of
      the
      securities and assets held by the Company for which market quotations are not
      readily available. In making its determination, the Board of Directors may
      consider valuation appraisals provided by independent financial experts although
      doing so does not relieve the Board of its obligations to determine fair value.
      With respect to private equity  securities,
      each investment is valued using industry valuation benchmarks, and then the
      value may be assigned a discount reflecting the particular nature of the
      investment.  

The
        Board
        of Directors bases its determination on, among other things, applicable
        quantitative and qualitative factors. These factors may include, but are
        not
        limited to, the type of securities, the nature of the business of the portfolio
        company, the marketability of the valuation of securities of publicly traded
        companies in the same or similar industries, current financial conditions
        and
        operating results of the portfolio company, sales and earnings growth of
        the
        portfolio company, operating revenues of the portfolio company, competitive
        conditions, and current and prospective conditions in the overall stock market.

12 

Without
      a
      readily recognized market value, the estimated value of some portfolio
      securities may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on
      the
      portfolio if there existed a ready market for such equity
      securities. 

The
      Company may retain a professional valuation consulting firm to provide it with
      valuations of the securities of portfolio companies. The Company expects to
      pay
      a professional fee each time such a valuation is provided. 

Financial
      Condition  

The
      Company s total assets were $4,021,824 and its net assets were $2,304,214 at
      January 31, 2006, compared to $3,010,892 and $2,296,038, respectively, at April
      30, 2005. Net assets increased by $8,176 for the nine months ended January
      31,
      2006, and net asset value per share was $0.48 per share at January 31, 2006
      and
      $0.48 per share at April 30, 2005. 

The
      changes in total assets and net assets during the nine months ended January
      31,
      2006 were primarily attributable to: 

The
                decrease in unrealized appreciation on investments of approximately
                $784,000 mainly due to a decrease in value of shares of PSI-TEC Holdings,
                Inc., Gelstat Corporation, and Neptune Industries, Inc. offset in
                part by
                an increase in the value of the shares of Theater Xtreme Entertainment
                Group, Inc and BroadRelay Holdings, Inc.

The
                increase of 200,000 shares in the Company s investment in PSI-TEC
                Holdings, Inc. 

The
      Company s unrealized appreciation (depreciation) varies significantly from
      period to period as a result of the wide fluctuations in value of the Company s
      portfolio securities. For example, the Company suffered an unrealized loss
      of
      $1,111,250 on its holdings of PSI-TEC Holdings, Inc. in the nine months ended
      January 31, 2006 as a result of a decline in the value of the portfolio shares
      from $2,232,500 to $1,121,250 during such time period. By contrast, the Company
      incurred an unrealized gain as a result of the listing of the shares of
      BroadRelay Holdings, Inc. for trading on the Pink Sheets and the increase in
      the
      price of the portfolio shares to $1,148,194 on January 31, 2006. 

The
        Company had unrealized appreciation of $834,036, net of taxes, at January
        31,
        2006 compared to unrealized appreciation of $497,354, net of taxes, at January
        31, 2005. 

The
        Company s financial condition is dependent on a number of factors including the
        ability of each portfolio company to effectuate its respective strategies
        with
        the Company s help. The Company has invested a substantial portion of its assets
        in development stage or start-up companies. These businesses are frequently
        thinly capitalized, unproven, small companies that may lack management depth,
        and may be dependent on new or commercially unproven technologies, and may
        have
        no operating history.  

13 

At
      January 31, 2006, $3,923,936 or 98.0% of the Company s assets consisted of
      investments, of which net unrealized gains before the income tax effect was
      $1,384,336. Deferred taxes on account of unrealized gains have been estimated
      at
      approximately $550,300. At January 31, 2006, the Company s holdings of PSI-TEC
      Holdings, Inc., BroadRelay Holdings, Inc. and AccelaPure Corporation were valued
      at $1,121,250, $1,148,194 and $1,000,000 respectively, which represented in
      the
      aggregate approximately 83% of the total Company portfolio at that
      date. 

Because
      the portfolio companies tend to be at early stages of their business
      development, and because there are no markets for the securities of some
      portfolio companies, the Company does not expect to liquidate any of its
      investments in the near future. 

Results
      of Operations     

The
      Company s financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the U.S.
      generally accepted accounting principles. On this basis, the principal measure
      of an investment company s financial performance during a time period is the net
      change in net assets during such period. Such change results from (i) income
      from operations, net of operating expenses, (ii) net realized gain or loss
      on
      investment, which is the difference between the proceeds received from
      dispositions of portfolio securities and their cost, and (iii) increase
      (decrease) in unrealized appreciation on investments. 

Company
      expenses include salaries and wages, professional fees, office expenses and
      supplies, rent, travel, and other normal business expenses. General and
      administrative costs include rent, depreciation, office, investor relations
      and
      other overhead costs. 

Three
      months ended January 31, 2006 compared to the three months ended January 31,
      2005.  

The
      Company generated revenue for services of $329,517 for the three months ended
      January 31, 2006 compared to $0.00 for the three months ended January 31, 2005.
      100% of the Company s revenue for services was received in the form of equity
      securities for the three months ended January 31, 2006.  

Total
      operating expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2006 were $221,906,
      the principal components of which were payroll of $109,153, professional fees
      of
      $33,962, travel and entertainment of $22,956, bad debt of $19,350 and insurance
      of $15,673. These expenses compared to $162,291 for the three months ended
      January 31, 2005, the principal components of which were payroll of $104,500,
      and professional fees of $32,066. 

The
      Company realized income from operations of $107,611 for the three months ended
      January 31, 2006 compared to a loss from operations of ($162,291) for the three
      months ended January 31, 2005. 

Nine
      months ended January 31, 2006 compared to the nine months ended January 31,
      2005.  

The
      Company generated revenue for services of $572,817 for the nine months ended
      January 31, 2006 compared to $10,000 for the period August 16, 2004 (date of
      inception) to January 31, 2005. 100% of the Company s revenue for services was
      received in the form of equity securities for the nine months ended January
      31,
      2006 and for the period August 16, 2004 (date of inception) to January 31,
      2005.

Total
        operating expenses for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 were $703,816,
        the
        principal components of which were payroll of $341,653, professional fees
        of
        $189,225, insurance of $47,763 and travel and entertainment of $45,011. These
        expenses compared to $194,430 for the period August 16, 2004 (date of inception)
        to January 31, 2005 the principal components of which were payroll of $104,500
        and professional fees of $45,971.  

14 

The
      Company realized a loss from operations of ($130,999) for the nine months ended
      January 31, 2006 compared to a loss from operations of ($184,430) for the period
      August 16, 2004 (date of inception) to January 31, 2005.  

The
      Company had unrealized depreciation of $(420,740), net of taxes, for the nine
      months ended January 31, 2006 compared to unrealized appreciation of $497,354,
      net of taxes, for the period August 16, 2004 (date of inception) to January
      31,
      2005. 

On
      January 31, 2006, the Company had a net operating loss carry-forward of
      approximately $656,060 which, if not used, will expire in 2025. 

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources   

From
      inception, the Company has relied for liquidity on the infusion of capital
      through capital share transactions.  

The
      Company does not plan to dispose of any of its current portfolio securities
      to
      meet operational needs. However, despite its plans, the Company may be forced
      to
      dispose of a portion of these securities if it ever becomes short of cash.
      Any
      such dispositions may have to be made at inopportune times and there is no
      assurance that, in light of the lack of liquidity in such shares, they could
      be
      sold at all, or if sold, could bring values approximating the estimates of
      fair
      value set forth in the Company financial statements.  

The
      Company s cash expenses approximate $70,000 per month. Because Company revenues,
      when received, tend to be in the form of portfolio securities, such revenues
      are
      not of a type capable of being used to satisfy the Company s ongoing monthly
      expenses. Consequently, for the Company to be able to avoid having to defer
      expenses or sell portfolio companies  securities to raise cash to pay operating
      expenses, it will need to sell at least $70,000 per month of common stock.
      There
      is no assurance that the Company will be able to do so. The Company will be
      unable to make any new investments unless it succeeds in raising cash in excess
      of the amounts needed for ongoing operations. At January 31, 2006 the Company
      had approximately $30,000 in cash and liquid assets.  

The
      Company is currently offering to sell, on a best efforts basis, up to $4,000,000
      of its common stock, $.001 par value per share at a price of not less than
      $2.00
      per share pursuant to Regulation E promulgated under the Securities Act of
      1933.
      The offering is open only to appropriate investors in states where the Company
      has complied with the appropriate Blue Sky laws. Potential investors have been
      referred to the Company by current shareholders and acquaintances of its Board
      of Directors and Board of Advisors.  

The
      Company provides its prospective investors with its Offering Circular dated
      March 15, 2006 and a Subscription Agreement governed by the laws of the State
      of
      Delaware. At the following dates the Company had sold the respective number
      of
      shares indicated pursuant to the offering: 

15 

Management
      believes that the Company will continue to be successful in its fundraising
      efforts and in attracting new portfolio companies because of expressions of
      interest received by the Company from attractive development stage companies
      seeking funding and because of the Company s success in raising funds thus
      far. 

The
      Company s note payable to BroadRelay Holdings, Inc. in the face amount of
      $100,000 comes due on May 31, 2006. The Company does not currently have the
      cash
      to pay its obligations under this note. The only means the Company has to obtain
      such cash is through the sale of additional shares of Company common stock
      or
      the sale of portfolio securities. There is no assurance that the Company will
      be
      able to sell enough shares before the maturity date of the note to pay its
      ongoing cash obligations and the amount due under the note. 

Critical
      Accounting Estimates  

Valuation 

The
      Investment Company Act of 1940 requires periodic valuation of each investment
      in
      the Company s portfolio to determine the Company s net asset value  .
        Under
      the
      Investment Company Act of 1940, unrestricted securities with readily available
      market quotations are to be valued at the current market value; all other assets
      must be valued at  fair value  as determined in good faith by or under the
      direction of the Board of Directors. 

The
      Board
      of Directors is responsible for   (1)   determining
      overall valuation guidelines and   (2)   ensuring
      the valuation of investments within the prescribed guidelines. 

Fair
      value is generally defined as the amount for which an investment could be sold
      in an orderly disposition over a reasonable time. Generally, to increase
      objectivity in valuing assets, external measures of value, such as public
      markets or third-party transactions, are used whenever possible. Valuation
      is
      not based on long-term work-out value, or immediate liquidation value, or
      incremental value for potential changes that may take place in the future.
      The
      values assigned to Company investments are based on available information and
      do
      not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized, as such
      amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot reasonably be determined
      until
      the individual investments are actually liquidated. 

The
      Company s valuation policy and methodology with respect to its portfolio
      companies are as follows: 

Cost:
      The
      cost method is based on the Company s original cost. This method is generally
      used in the early stages of a portfolio company s development until significant
      events occur subsequent to the date of the original investment that dictates
      a
      change to another valuation method. Some examples of these events are:
  (1)   a
      major recapitalization;   (2)   a
      major refinancing;   (3)   a
      significant third-party transaction;   (4)   the
      development of a meaningful public market for such company s common stock; and
  (5)   significant
      changes in such company s business. 

Private
        Market: The private market method uses actual, executed, historical transactions
        in a portfolio company s securities by responsible third parties as a basis for
        valuation  .
          The
        private market method may also use, where applicable, unconditional firm
        offers
        by responsible third parties as a basis for valuation. 

Public
        Market: The public market method is used when there is an established public
        market for the class of the portfolio company s securities held by the Company.
        However, the Company discounts market value for securities that are subject
        to
        significant legal or contractual restrictions. Other securities, for which
        market quotations are readily available, are carried at market value as of
        the
        time of valuation. Market value for securities traded on a securities exchange
        or on the Nasdaq National Market is the last reported sales price on the
        day of
        valuation. For other securities traded in the over-the-counter market
        and 

16 

listed
      securities for which no sale was reported on a day, market value is the last
      quoted bid price on such day. 

Analytical
      Method: The analytical method is generally used to value an investment position
      when there is no established public or private market in the portfolio company s
      securities or when the factual information available to the Company dictates
      that an investment should no longer be valued under either the cost or private
      market method. This valuation method is inherently imprecise and ultimately,
      the
      result of reconciling the judgments of our directors based on the data available
      to them. The resulting valuation, although stated as a precise number, is
      necessarily within a range of values that vary depending upon the significance
      attributed to the various factors being considered. Some of the factors
      considered may include the financial condition and operating results of the
      portfolio company, the long-term potential of the business of such company,
      the
      values of similar securities issued by companies in similar businesses, the
      proportion of the portfolio company s securities owned by the Company and the
      nature of any rights to require the portfolio company to register restricted
      securities under applicable securities laws. 

Item
      3.        
      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  

There
      have been no material changes in the Company s quantitative and qualitative
      disclosure about market risk since the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K
      filed for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2005. 

Item
      4.        
      Controls and Procedures  

Under
      the
      supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal
      executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the
      effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
      procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
      of
      1934 (the  Exchange Act )). Based upon that evaluation, the principal executive
      officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end
      of
      the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were
      effective. 

There
      were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined
      in
      Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this report
      that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
      our
      internal control over financial reporting.

Item
      4.          Submission
      of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.  

The
      Company held its Annual Meeting of Stockholders on Wednesday, December 7, 2005.
      Shareholders voted on three matters, the substance of these matters and the
      results of the voting on each such matter are described below. The record date
      was October 13, 2005, at which time there were 5,076,800 shares outstanding
      and
      entitled to vote at the annual meeting. 

The
      first
      proposal was to elect five Directors: Michael D. Queen, Joseph T, Drennan,
      Jeffrey Muchow, Steven P. Pruitt, Jr. and Thomas M. Pickard, Sr. to serve until
      the date of the 2006 annual meeting and until their successors are respectively
