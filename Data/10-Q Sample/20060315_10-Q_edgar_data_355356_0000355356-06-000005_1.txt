Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements

In the interest of providing the Company's  stockholders and potential investors
with certain  information  regarding the Company's  future plans and operations,
certain  statements  set forth in this Form 10-K relate to  management's  future
plans and objectives.  Such statements are  "forward-looking  statements" within
the  meaning of Section  27A of the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as  amended,  and
Section 21E of the  Securities  Act of 1934,  as amended.  Although  any forward
looking statements  contained in this Form 10-Q or otherwise expressed on behalf
of the Company  are, to the  knowledge  and in the  judgment of the officers and
directors  of the  Company,  expected to prove to come true and to come to pass,
management  is not able to predict the future with absolute  certainty.  Forward
looking statements  involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  which may
cause the Company's actual  performance and financial  results in future periods
to differ materially from any projection,  estimate or forecasted result.  These
risks and  uncertainties  include,  among other things,  volatility of commodity
prices,  changes in interest rates and capital market  conditions,  competition,
risks inherent in the Company's operations, the inexact nature of interpretation
of seismic and other geological,  geophysical,  petro-physical  and geo-chemical
data,  the  imprecise  nature of  estimating  reserves,  events that deprive the
Company of the services of its Chairman of the Board,  Chief  Executive  Officer
and largest  shareholder,  and such other risks and  uncertainties  as described
from  time to time in the  Company's  periodic  reports  and  filings  with  the
Securities  and Exchange  Commission.  Accordingly  stockholders  and  potential
investors are cautioned that certain events or circumstances  could cause actual
results to differ materially from those projected,  estimated or predicted.  The
Company does not intend to update forward-looking  statements.  You should refer
to and carefully  review the  information  in future  documents we file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

The Company

Imperial Petroleum, Inc., a Nevada corporation ("the Company"), is a diversified
energy,  and mineral mining company  headquartered in Evansville,  Indiana.  The
Company has historically been engaged in the production and exploration of crude
oil and natural  gas in  Oklahoma  and Texas and had  diversified  its  business

9

activities to include mineral mining, with a particular emphasis on gold mining.
The Company  re-focused its efforts in the oil and natural gas business with the
acquisitions of assets from Warrior  Resources,  Inc. and Hillside Oil & Gas LLC
and is seeking to sell or develop through  partnerships  or joint ventures,  its
mining assets.

At January 31, 2006,  the Company  operated 134 oil and gas wells in Texas,  New
Mexico,  Louisiana  and  Mississippi  and  owned an  interest  in an  additional
approximately  280 wells  operated  by  others.  Net daily  production  from the
Company's oil and gas properties  averaged  approximately  87 Bopd and 711 Mcfpd
during the quarter ended January 31, 2006. The Company acquired an additional 24
wells in  Kentucky  and will  become  operators  of each of these wells when its
leasing and bonding process is complete.  The Company's estimated net proven oil
and gas reserves as of July 31, 2005 were 799.1 MBO and 15,162 MMCFG.  No proved
reserves are included for the Kentucky  properties.  The Company is the operator
of the Duke Gold  Mine in Utah,  although  no  significant  operations  occurred
during the current quarter.

Historical Background

The Company was  incorporated on January 16, 1981 and is the surviving member of
a  merger  between  itself,   Imperial  Petroleum,   Inc.,  a  Utah  corporation
incorporated on June 4, 1979 (" Imperial-Utah"), and Calico Exploration Corp., a
Utah corporation incorporated on September 27, 1979 ("Calico").  The Company was
reorganized  under a  Reorganization  Agreement  and Plan and  Article of Merger
dated August 31, 1981  resulting in the Company  being  domiciled in Nevada.  On
August  11,  1982,  Petro  Minerals  Technology,  Inc.  ("Petro"),  a 94% -owned
subsidiary  of  Commercial  Technology  Inc.  ("Comtec")  acquired  58%  of  the
Company's  common  stock.  Petro  assigned to the Company its  interests  in two
producing  oil and gas  properties  in  consideration  for  5,000,000  shares of
previously authorized but unissued shares of common stock of the Company and for
a $500,000 line of credit to develop these properties. Petro has since undergone
a corporate  reorganization and is now known as Petro Imperial  Corporation.  On
August 1,1988 in an assumption of assets and liabilities  agreement,  58% of the
Company's common stock was acquired from Petro by Glauber Management Co., a 100%
owned  subsidiary of Glauber Valve Co., Inc.  Change of Control.  Pursuant to an
Agreement  to Exchange  Stock and Plan of  Reorganization  dated August 27, 1993
(the "Stock Exchange Agreement"),  as amended by that certain First Amendment to
Agreement to Exchange  Stock and Plan of  Reorganization  dated as of August 27,
1993, (the "First Amendment"), between Imperial Petroleum, Inc. (the "Company"),
Glauber Management Company, a Texas corporation, ("Glauber Management"), Glauber
Valve Co Inc.,  a Nebraska  corporation,  ("Glauber  Valve"),  Jeffrey T. Wilson
("Wilson"),  James G.  Borem  ("Borem")  and those  persons  listed on Exhibit A
attached to the Stock Exchange  Agreement and First Amendment (the  "Ridgepointe
Stockholders");   the   Ridgepointe   Stockholders   agreed  to  exchange   (the
"Ridgepointe  Exchange  Transaction") a total of 12,560,730 shares of the common
stock of Ridgepointe  Mining Company,  a Delaware  corporation  ("Ridgepointe"),
representing 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Ridgepointe, for
a total of  12,560,730  newly  issued  shares  of the  Company's  common  stock,
representing  59.59% of the Company's  resulting  issued and outstanding  common
stock.  Under the terms of the Stock Exchange  Agreement,  (i) Wilson  exchanged
5,200,000  shares  of  Ridgepointe  common  stock  for  5,200,000  shares of the
Company's  common  stock  representing   24.67%  of  the  Company's  issued  and
outstanding  common stock, (ii) Borem exchanged  1,500,000 shares of Ridgepointe
common stock for  1,500,000  shares of the Company's  common stock  representing

10

7.12% of the  Company's  issued  and  outstanding  common  stock,  and (iii) the
remaining  Ridgepointe  Stockholders in the aggregate exchanged 5,860,730 shares
of  Ridgepointe   common  stock  for  5,860,730  of  the  Company's  issued  and
outstanding  common  stock,  representing,  in  the  aggregate,  27.81%  of  the
Company's  issued and  outstanding  common  stock.  The one for-one ratio of the
number of shares of the  Company's  common  stock  exchanged  for each  share of
Ridgepointe common stock was determined through arms length negotiations between
the Company,  Wilson and Borem. The Ridgepointe  Exchange Transaction was closed
on August 27, 1993. As a result,  Ridgepointe is now a wholly,  owned subsidiary
of the  Company.  At the time of  acquisition,  Ridgepointe  was  engaged in the
development  of a copper ore mining  operation in Yavapai  County,  Arizona and,
through its wholly owned subsidiary,  I.B. Energy, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation
("I.B  Energy"),  in the  exploration  for and  production of oil and gas in the
Mid-continent and Gulf Coast regions of the United States.

In connection with the closing of the  Ridgepointe  Exchange  Transaction,  each
member of the Board of Directors of the Company  resigned and Wilson,  Borem and
Dewitt C. Shreve ("Shreve") were elected Directors of the Company.  In addition,
each officer of the Company  resigned and the  Company's  new Board of Directors
elected Wilson as Chairman of the Board,  President and Chief Executive Officer,
Borem as Vice  President  and Cynthia A. Helms as Secretary of the Company.  Ms.
Helms subsequently  resigned and Kathryn H. Shepherd was elected Secretary.  Mr.
Borem,  Mr. Shreve and Ms.  Shepherd  subsequently  resigned and Mr.  Malcolm W.
Henley and Mrs.  Stacey D.  Smethers  were  elected  to the Board.  The Board of
Directors  further  authorized  the move of the  Company's  principal  executive
offices from Dallas,  Texas to its current offices in Evansville,  Indiana. As a
condition to closing the Ridgepointe Exchange Transaction,  the Company received
and canceled  7,232,500  shares of the Company's common stock from the Company's
former partner,  Glauber  Management,  and 100,000 shares of the common stock of
Tech-Electro  Technologies,  Inc from an  affiliate  of Glauber  Management  and
Glauber  Valve.  In  addition,  pursuant  to the terms of the  First  Amendment,
Glauber  Management or Glauber Valve, or their  affiliates,  were to transfer to
the Company 75,000 shares of common stock of Wexford Technology,  Inc. (formerly
Chelsea Street  Financial  Holding  Corp.) no later than October 31, 1993,  such
transfer subsequently occurred.

On August 15, 2001, Mr. Malcolm W. Henley and Mrs.  Stacey D. Smethers  resigned
their  positions as directors  of the Company to pursue other  interests.  Their
vacancies have been filled with Mrs.  Annalee C. Wilson and Mr. Aaron M. Wilson,
both family members of the Company's President and Chairman, until new directors
are elected at the next shareholder's meeting.

On October 31, 2001,  Imperial and Rx Power, a California  corporation  signed a
non-binding  letter of intent  wherein  the two  companies  would form a Special
Purpose  Vehicle  ("SPV")  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  financing  for  the
installation of Rx Power's proprietary electric generator units. Imperial was to
contribute  stock,  cash or  financing  up to the amount of  $2,000,000  in five
phases  for a 45%  interest  in the cash  flow  from the SPV and Rx Power was to
contribute its existing  contracts and future marketing efforts to the SPV for a
45% interest in the SPV. The project was to be managed by a third party, subject
to  certain  limitations  imposed  by  both  companies.  The  parties  signed  a
definitive  agreement in February 2002 for the  consummation of the transaction.
The  electricity  generator units being developed by Rx Power offer cost savings
to customers up to 25% from their present  electricity source based upon the use
of  proprietary   electronic  components  and  technological   advances  in  the
generation of electricity using natural gas. The primary target market for these
units,  initially,  is California.  Rx Power is still completing the testing and
development of its initial  commercial unit. As a result no activity occurred in
the SPV during this fiscal year.  As a result of the  continued  inability of Rx

11

Power to provide a suitable unit for demonstration,  the Company does not expect
the venture to proceed.

The Company entered into and closed the acquisition of 29,484,572  shares of the
common  stock of Warrior  Resources,  Inc.  (formerly  Comanche  Energy,  Inc.),
representing approximately 30.8% of the issued and outstanding shares of Warrior
on February 13, 2002 in connection  with an Exchange  Agreement  (See  "Exchange
Agreement"  included  herein) between the Company and the management of Warrior,
Messers.  Luther  Henderson  and John Bailey.  In  connection  with the Exchange
Agreement, the Company issued 2,266,457 shares of its restricted common stock to
Mr.  Henderson,  representing  12.9 % of the  issued and  outstanding  shares of
Registrant in exchange for 22,664,572  shares of the common stock of Warrior and
682,000 shares of its restricted  common stock to Mr. John Bailey,  representing
3.9 % of the issued  and  outstanding  shares of the  Company  in  exchange  for
6,820,000  shares of the common stock of Warrior.  Mr. Bailey and Mr.  Henderson
resigned as officers and directors of Warrior and Mr. Jeffrey Wilson,  president
of  the  Company,   was  appointed  president  and  sole  director  of  Warrior.
Simultaneously with the closing of the Exchange Agreement with Messrs. Henderson
and Bailey and the change of control of  Warrior,  the Company  entered  into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, subject to certain conditions, to offer to acquire
the  remaining  issued  and  outstanding  capital  stock of  Warrior  through  a
subsequent offering to be registered with the Securities & Exchange  Commission.
The terms of the proposed exchange of shares with the remaining  shareholders of
Warrior was on the basis of one share of Imperial  common  stock in exchange for
ten shares of Warrior  common  stock.  Completion  of the  Agreement and Plan of
Merger was  subject  to a number of  conditions,  including  the  completion  of
audited financials for Warrior, approval of the Warrior stockholders, the filing
and effectiveness of a registration statement by Registrant for the shares to be
offered,  the  satisfactory  completion  of due  diligence  and other  customary
closing  conditions.  Due to breaches of the agreements by the former management
of Warrior,  the Company  terminated  the proposed  merger in August 2002.  As a
result of the termination of the merger agreement,  the Company had the right to
receive $200,000 or an equivalent value in shares of Warrior valued at $0.02 per
share.

On July 15,  2003,  the  Company  and Warrior  signed an  Agreement  wherein the
Company  would  acquire  the assets and certain  liabilities  of Warrior and its
subsidiaries  in exchange for payment or assumption  of the Warrior  senior bank
debt in the approximate amount of $3.65 million;  (2) extinguishment of the note
payable  from  Warrior  to the  Company  in the  amount  of  $1.7  million;  (3)
assumption  of certain trade vendor  liabilities  in the  approximate  amount of
$0.58  million and the issuance to Warrior of 2 million  shares of the Company's
common  stock.  Closing of the  transaction  was subject to, among other things,
approval of Warrior's  shareholders,  which was received on August 29,2003.  The
Company  closed the Warrior asset  acquisition  in January  2004.  (See Form 8-K
filed January 29,2004).

In April  2003,  the  Company  agreed to acquire  certain  oil and  natural  gas
interests owned by Renovared Resources,  Inc.  ("Renovared") located in Kentucky
for $30,000.  The properties  comprise interests in approximately 44 wells and a
pipeline and  gathering  system  located in the New Albany  Shale Gas play.  The
Company  completed the Renovared  acquisition in December 2004. In May 2003, the
Company  acquired  approximately  54% control of the stock of Powder River Basin
Gas  Corp in an  Exchange  Agreement  with the  former  management  and  control
shareholders of Powder River.  (See Form 8-K dated May 2003). The Company issued
a total of 2.65 million shares of its restricted common stock and a note payable
in the  amount of  $200,000  in the  transaction.  As a result  of the  Exchange
Transaction,  Powder  River  became a  consolidated  subsidiary  of the Company.
Powder  River  owns some  7,000 net acres of leases in the  Powder  River  Basin

12

coalbed methane gas play in Wyoming.  In October 2003 the Company entered into a
letter of understanding and a subsequent stock sale agreement to sell 23,885,000
shares of the  common  stock of Powder  River  Basin Gas Corp of the  25,385,000
shares it  presently  owns.  Under the terms of the sale,  the Company  received
$175,000 in cash (less  broker's  fees of 10%);  a secured note in the amount of
$47,884.47;  and a 12.5%  carried  working  interest in the  development  of the
leases  owned by Powder  River.  The  purchaser  is  required  to  purchase  the
convertible  notes of Powder River in the approximate  amount of $315,000 and to
commit a minimum of $750,000 to the  development  of the leases  owned by Powder
River.  The Powder River sale was closed  December 17, 2003. (See Form 8-K filed
December  29, 2003 and amended Form 8-K filed  February 23, 2004 with  financial
information).

On July 7, 2003 the Company  agreed to acquire the assets of Hillside  Oil & Gas
LLC.  The  transaction  was closed on January 16,  2004.  Under the terms of the
agreement  and  amendments  thereto,  the  Company  acquired  the  oil  and  gas
properties  of Hillside for (1) the payment of its senior debt of  approximately
$4.6 million;  (2) the  assumption of an equipment note payable of $0.3 million;
(3) the payment of certain  obligations of Hillside at closing of $168,000;  (4)
the assumption of approximately $348,000 in accounts payable of Hillside and (5)
issuance of a note  payable to Hillside in the amount of $324,000 and secured by
1 million shares of the Company's common stock. Hillside operated some 113 wells
in  Texas,  New  Mexico  and  Louisiana  and as a  result  of  the  transaction,
operations were assumed by the Company. (See Form 8-K filed January 29, 2004).

In October 2003 the Company sold 2,000,000 shares of restricted  common stock to
RAB Special  Situations LP for $200,000 and a common stock  purchase  warrant in
the amount of 2,000,000  shares  exercisable  at $0.12 per share.  Demand rights
were granted in connection  with the  issuance.  The term of the warrant was one
year.  The warrant was  subsequently  exercised in October 2004. The proceeds of
the sale were used to fund the ongoing expense of the acquisition  effort of the
Company and for working capital purposes.

In October  2003 the  Company  retired the note  payable of  $200,000  which had
resulted from the  acquisition  of Powder River Basin Gas Corp with the issuance
of 2,000,000  shares of  restricted  common  stock and a common  stock  purchase
warrant  in the amount of  2,000,000  shares at an  exercise  price of $0.14 per
share. Demand rights were granted with the issuance. The term of the warrant was
one year and expired without being exercised.

On January 16, 2004 the Company  completed the  above-mentioned  acquisitions of
the assets of Hillside and Warrior for a total  consideration  of  approximately
$12.6 million  including  broker and financing fees. As a result of the closing,
the  Company  incurred  long term  debt in the  amount  of  approximately  $11.0
million,  including  approximately  $0.25  million in working  capital  and $0.6
million in capital available for workovers.  The total debt facility is an $18.0
million revolving loan and is based upon a periodic  evaluation of the Company's
reserves by the lender. (See Form 8-K dated January 29, 2004.) (Refer to Capital
Resources  and  Liquidity  below  for more  details  about the terms of the debt
financing.)

The Company completed the acquisition of a 16% non-operated  working interest in
the Coquille  Bay Field of south  Louisiana in May 2004 from Royal-T oil Company
for $800,000  which was funded out of additional  borrowings  from the Company's
revolving line of credit.  The  properties  are located in  Plaquemines  Parish,
Louisiana.  The Company  acquired the remaining  interests  owned by Royal-T and
became the operator of the project during the quarter. The Company's interest in
the project  increased  to a 22% working  interest.  As a result of  non-consent
operations  under the Joint Operating  Agreement,  the Company now controls some
40% of the project.

                                       13

The Company  signed a  definitive  agreement  to acquire a 50% working  interest
position in certain wells and leases owned by Arkana  Operating  Company located
in the Arkoma Basin of Oklahoma and Arkansas for $917,000.  After conducting its
due diligence, the Company terminated the transaction due to title deficiencies.

The Company  completed  the  purchase  of the rights to 31 wells and  associated
leases in Guadalupe  county,  Texas for the  development  of proved  behind pipe
reserves of approximately 300,000 bbls. from Caltex Operating Company and Apache
Energy in June 2004.  The proposed  formation is the Pecan Gap a t 1900 feet and
has been logged and cored in most of the wells on the leases. The Company issued
a total of 1.375  million  shares of its  restricted  common stock in connection
with the  acquisition  and  closing  fees.  The Company  has not  completed  any
workovers on the wells to date and has not taken over  operations  of any of the
wells.

On October 14, 2004 the Company signed a Merger  Agreement with United  Heritage
Corporation  wherein  the  Company  would  merge with and become a  wholly-owned
subsidiary  of United  Heritage on the basis of 1 share of UHCP common stock for
each 3 shares of IPTM common stock. The Company and United Heritage extended the
original  time to complete  the merger in order to complete  the  necessary  SEC
filings and Proxy  Solicitations  to consummate the merger.  In August 2005, the
Company  terminated  its  involvement  in the merger with  United  Heritage as a
result of the  potential  sale of 70% of the Cato field by United  Heritage to a
third party group.

In  November  2004,  the  Company  completed  the  change of  control of Warrior
Resources,  Inc. to Universal  Wireline Equipment LLC, a company based in Tulsa,
OK. The Company retained 5 million shares of its previously owned Warrior common
stock in connection  with the change of control and received  720,000  shares of
Imperial common stock which was previously  held by Warrior.  With the change of
control,  the Company sold certain  rights to its Duke Gold Mine and received an
additional  5 million  shares of  Warrior  common  stock and  retained  a 5% net
smelter  royalty in any  proceeds  from mining and  processing  of the Duke Mine
claims in the future. Subsequent to closing, Warrior advised the Company that it
would be unable to fulfill the obligations relating to the Duke Mine acquisition
and the Company  received a re-assignment  of the mining claims and retained the
shares of  Warrior  stock as  liquidated  damages,  effectively  un-winding  the
transaction.

In January 2005, the Company acquired operations from Royal-T Oil Company,  Inc.
in the Coquille Bay field of Louisiana and agreed to acquire  certain  interests
owned by Royal-T resulting in an additional 6.05 % working interest and 10.235 %
net revenue interest. The Company issued 891,402 shares of its restricted common
stock and  agreed to utilize  Mr. Red  Reeves,  the  President  of Royal-T as an
operations  consultant  for the  field  for a period  of 12  months at a cost of
$6,000 per month. The transaction was closed in April, 2005.

In May 2005,  the  Company  agreed to acquire an interest in the Bastian Bay S/L
1652 #1 well for a  commitment  to  perform a  workover  on the well to  restore
production.   The  Company  controls  82%  working  interest  in  the  well.  No
out-of-pocket consideration was paid for the rights to the well.

The  Company  signed a  Forbearance  Agreement  and  Amendment  Number  Three to
Consolidate  Amended and Restated Credit  Agreement with its Senior Lender dated
as of November 30, 2005.  (reference  is made to the Form 8-K dated  December 5,
2005 as filed).  In connection  with that  Agreement,  the Company has engaged a

14

Financial  Advisor  as of  December  8,  2005  to  assist  the  Company  in  the
restructuring  of its senior debt. A subsequent  agreement signed by the Company
and its Senior Lender in February 2006 has extended the date for completion of a
Restructuring  Transaction until April 30, 2006.  (reference is made to the Form
8-K dated 2/23/06 as filed.)

 (2)  ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and
footnotes  required by generally  accepted  accounting  principles  for complete
financial statements. In the opinion of management,  all adjustments (consisting
of only normal recurring  items)  considered  necessary for a fair  presentation
have been included.

(3)  NOTES PAYABLE

The Company enters into private notes primarily from its major shareholders from
time-to-time in the course of funding its oil and gas and other  activities.  In
addition to the private  notes the Company has the following  note  obligations:
(1.) a term  loan  from a bank in the name of  Hillside  Oil & Gas for which the
Company makes the monthly payments in connection with its purchase of a workover
rig from Hillside;  (2.)a secured line of credit facility with its senior lender
and a subordinated  loan with a bank in connection  with the financing  arranged
for the purchase of the assets of Hillside  Oil & Gas and the Warrior  Resources
Inc. each of which is further discussed below under the section entitled Capital
Liquidity and  Resources.  As of January 31, 2006,  the Company had a total of 3
notes payable to individuals and private companies  totaling $0.691 million,  in
principal,  of which $0.61 was with its Chairman and President. A total of $0.08
million of the  remaining  notes  resulted  from the  agreement  to purchase the
Hillside workover rig. The Company settled the remaining balance of the Hillside
note,  approximately $0.21 million during the quarter ended October 31, 2005 for
restricted common stock.

Item 2.          Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
                 Condition and Results of Operations.

                                     GENERAL

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The factors which most significantly  affect the Company's results of operations
are (i) the sale prices of crude oil and natural gas,  (ii) the level of oil and
gas sales,  (iii) the level of lease  operating  expenses  (iv) the level of and
interest rates on borrowings and (v) the timing of acquisitions.  As a result of
the   acquisition  of  the  Warrior  and  Hillside  assets  and  the  successful
implementation  of a workover  program,  the Company now has positive  cash flow
from its operations.

Development  of its oil and  natural  gas  leases  will  subject  the  Company's
revenues  to the  fluctuations  inherent  in the  energy  business  for the last
several years. Crude oil and natural gas prices have reached record highs during
the last several months and expectations  are that prices for these  commodities

15

will remain above prior levels in the future. Current crude oil prices as posted
on the New York Mercantile  Exchange  (NYMEX) are in the $60.00 per barrel range
as a result of concerns over supplies  while natural gas prices reached highs of
$12.00 per MMBTU but have retreated to approximately $6.50 per MMBTU at present.
The  Company  expects  energy  prices to  continue to be volatile in the future,
particularly in light of continued  terrorist  activities in the Middle East and
elsewhere  and  the  continued  strong  demand  for  petroleum  products  as the
economies  of the  world  maintain  strong  growth  patterns.  The  Company  had
previously  entered into hedging  contracts with respect to a portion of its oil
and  gas  production  to  minimize  any   significant   downward   energy  price
adjustments,  however at the present  time,  the Company does not have any hedge
agreements in place. The Company is also continuing to review additional hedging
opportunities for its production in view of the  substantially  increased prices
available today.

Three Months Comparison

Quarter  ended  January 31, 2006  compared to Quarter  ended  January 31,  2005.
Revenues for the three months ending January 31, 2006 were $979,980  compared to
revenues of  $615,410  for the  comparable  quarter  ended  January 31, 2005 and
represent a 59%  increase  over the prior year  period  despite a 7% decrease in
sales  volumes.  Revenues  reflect  the impact of  increased  oil and gas prices
during the most recent quarter compared to the prior period. Revenues reflect no
contribution  from sales of oil and gas for the Coquille Bay field that has been
shut in since early August as a result of Hurricane Katrina. The Company expects
revenues to increase  dramatically  when the  Coquille  Bay field is returned to
production.

Oil and gas  production  operating  expenses were $337,806 for the quarter ended
January 31, 2006 compared to $330,349 for the quarter ended January 31, 2005 and
represent  lease  operating  expenses  from oil and gas  interests  owned by the
Company. Operating expenses for the most recent quarter reflect normal levels of
operations. No significant expenses were incurred during the quarter on the Duke
gold mine.  Operating  expenses  are  expected  to increase  as  operations  and
production on the Coquille Bay field resume.

General and  administrative  costs were  $157,079  for the three  months  ending
January 31, 2006  compared  to $104,512  for the same period a year  earlier and
primarily  reflects the level  activity of the Company as a result of its recent
acquisitions.  The current quarter  reflects  additional  expenses  incurred for
reserve engineering, accounting fees and additional administrative fees incurred
as a result of the Forbearance Agreement. G&A should continue to increase as the
Company  adds  additional  staff.  Net  interest  expense for the  quarter  were
$605,575 in 2006  compared to $551,506  for the same period in 2005 and reflects
the  higher  borrowings  by the  Company  as a result  of its  acquisitions  and
operations. Interest expenses will continue to increase as the Company continues
to acquire  assets with debt  financing and  continues  its workover  program to
improve production.

The Company had an after-tax net loss of  $1,035,526  ($0.024 per share) for the
quarter ended  January 31, 2006  compared to a net loss of $587,349  ($0.014 per
share) for the  comparable  quarter a year earlier.  The increase in net loss is
primarily  attributable  to the fees booked in association  with the Forbearance
Agreement  of  $550,000.  Cash used in  operations  was $485,095 for the quarter
ending January 31, 2006 primarily from additional  borrowings and cash flow from
the properties.  The Company expects its net loss to increase until it completes
its workover efforts and re-finances its high interest rate debt.

16

Six Months Comparison

Six Months ended January 31, 2006 compared to Six Months ended January 31, 2005.
Revenues for the six months ending January 31, 2006 were $2,025,168  compared to
revenues of  $1,439,360  for the  comparable  period ended  January 31, 2005 and
represent a 41% increase  over the prior year period  despite an 18% decrease in
sales  volumes.  Revenues  reflect  the impact of  increased  oil and gas prices
during the most recent  period  compared to the prior  period.  Revenues for the
period ended January 31, 2006 reflect no contribution  from sales of oil and gas
for the  Coquille  Bay field,  while the prior  period  included  initial  sales
volumes of natural gas from the field.  The Company expects revenues to increase
dramatically when the Coquille Bay field is returned to production.

Oil and gas production operating expenses were $601,052 for the six months ended
January 31, 2006  compared to $737,948 for the six months ended January 31, 2005
and  represent a 22% decrease in expenses in the most recent  period as a result
of the  suspension  of  operations  at  Coquille  Bay due to the  hurricane.  No
significant  expenses were incurred  during either period on the Duke gold mine.
Operating  expenses are expected to increase as operations and production on the
Coquille Bay field resume.

General and administrative costs were $293,744 for the six months ending January
31, 2006  compared to $222,028 for the same period a year earlier and  primarily
reflects  the  level  activity  of  the  Company  as  a  result  of  its  recent
acquisitions.  The current  period  reflects  additional  expenses  incurred for
reserve engineering, accounting fees and additional administrative fees incurred
as a result of the Forbearance Agreement. G&A should continue to increase as the
Company adds  additional  staff.  Net  interest  expense for the six months were
$1,215,870  in 2006  compared  to  $1,035,167  for the same  period  in 2005 and
reflects the higher  borrowings  by the Company as a result of its  acquisitions
and  operations.  Interest  expenses  will  continue  to increase as the Company
continues  to acquire  assets with debt  financing  and  continues  its workover
program to improve production.

The Company had an after-tax net loss of  $1,367,513  ($0.031 per share) for the
six months ended January 31, 2006 compared to a net loss of $990,734 ($0.024 per
share) for the  comparable  period a year  earlier.  The increase in net loss is
primarily  attributable  to the fees booked in association  with the Forbearance
Agreement of $550,000. Cash used in operations was $ 790,849 for the  six months
ending January 31, 2006 primarily from additional  borrowings and cash flow from
the properties.  The Company expects its net loss to increase until it completes
its workover efforts and re-finances its high interest rate debt.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIOUIDITY

Because of the  closing  of the  Company's  asset  acquisitions,  the  Company's
capital  requirements relate primarily to the workover operations on its oil and
gas  properties  to  increase  production.  The  Company  has a  great  deal  of
flexibility   in  the  timing  and  amount  of  these   expenditures.   Workover
expenditures  for the most recent quarter totaled $718,114 which was funded from
borrowings under the Company's credit facility,  increases in trade payables and
out of cash flow generated by the properties.  Workover  expenses have increased
significantly  as a result of the  assumption  of operations at Coquille Bay and
the increase of the Company's interests from 22% working interest to 40% working
interest under the non-consent provisions of the operating agreement.

                                       17

Management  decided to terminate all of the Company's  mining lease  commitments
except the Duke Gold Mine in Utah during  fiscal 2000,  due to its  inability to
raise capital for those projects. As a result, the Company is active in only one
mine that will require significant capital  expenditures.  Presently the Company
is  seeking a capital  partner  to assist in the  development  of the mine.  The
Company has a wide degree of discretion in the level of capital  expenditures it
must  devote to the  mining  project  on an annual  basis and the  timing of its
development.  The Company had primarily been engaged,  prior to January 2004, in
the acquisition  and testing of mineral  properties to be inventoried for future
development.  Because of the relative magnitude of the capital expenditures that
may  ultimately  be required for any single  mining  venture as  operations  are
achieved,  management  had  pursued a  strategy  of  acquiring  properties  with
significant  mineral  potential in an effort to create a mineral  property  base
sufficient to allow the Company to access capital from external sources,  either
through debt or equity placements. After the acquisition of assets from Hillside
and Warrior in January 2004,  management  decided to seek a partner for the Duke
Mine and focus its  management  resources  and  limited  capital  on its oil and
natural gas  properties and to focus on additional  acquisitions  in the oil and
gas sector.

As a result of the Hillside and Warrior  acquisitions,  the Company completed an
$18 million revolving  financing of which approximately $11 million was required
at closing,  including  approximately  $0.25 million in working capital and $0.6
million  in  development  capital  for  workovers.  The  availability  under the
revolving  loan is subject to  semi-annual  evaluations of the Company's oil and
gas reserve base as determined  by the Lender and is reduced  monthly based upon
re-determinations  by the Company after taking into effect price changes and net
production.  As of the  closing  date of  January  16,  2004,  the  Company  had
available borrowing capacity of approximately $12 million based upon the current
oil and gas  properties  acquired  from  Warrior  and  Hillside.  Under  monthly
calculations  of the Borrowing  Base,  adjusted for production  and prices,  the
calculated  Borrowing  Base as of  January  31,  2006  was  approximately  $20.9
million.  The Borrowing  Base  decreased from prior periods as a result of a new
engineering report that was completed,  which became the new base reserve report
used in the  calculation of the Borrowing Base. The Revolving Loan has a term of
3 years  (January 15, 2007) and an interest rate of Prime Rate plus 8% (Interest
Rate for January 2006 was 15.25%).  The Revolving  Loan is subject to the normal
and customary  financial  covenants and is secured by a first  mortgage and lien
right to all of the Company's  operations and assets. As of January 31, 2006 the
Company was operating  under a Forbearance  Agreement  with its senior lender to
provide the Company sufficient time to re-finance its revolving loan or to raise
equity.  The term of the  Forbearance  Agreement,  as a result  of a  subsequent
Waiver  Agreement,  is through April 30, 2006 and provides that the Company will
complete a restructuring of its financing prior to that time. In connection with
the Agreement the Company retained a financial  advisor to assist in its efforts
to restructure the Company's  revolving loan. There can be no assurance that the
Company will complete a  restructuring  of its principal debt prior to April 30,
2006 or that  additional  extensions  of time will be afford the  Company by its
Senior Lender. If the Company does not complete a restructuring of the revolving
loan  prior  to  that  time,   its  Senior  Lender  may  seek  to  foreclose  on
substantially  all of the Company's oil and gas  properties.  In connection with
the  Revolving  Loan,  the Company also  completed a  subordinated  financing of
approximately  $650,000 with a Bank. The terms of the Subordinated Financing are
a term of 4 years from the closing date  (January 15, 2004) and an interest rate
of 4% per annum paid in kind and accrued to the loan  balance  due at  maturity.
The Company can retire the Subordinated debt only after payment of the Revolving
Loan.

18

The timing of  expenditures  for the  Company's  oil and  natural gas and mining
activities  are generally  distributed  over several  months,  and as such,  the
Company  anticipates  its current working capital will be sufficient to meet its
capital expenditures. The Company has no immediate plans to spend any capital on
the Duke Mine during the present  fiscal year.  The Company  believes it will be
required to access outside  capital either through debt or equity  placements or
through joint venture operations with other mining companies to develop the Duke
Mine.  There can be no  assurance  that the Company  will be  successful  in its
efforts to locate  outside  capital  and as a result the level of the  Company's
mining activities may need to be curtailed, deferred or abandoned entirely.

The  level  of the  Company's  capital  expenditures  will  vary  in the  future
depending  on  commodity  market  conditions  and upon the  level of oil and gas
activity  achieved  by the  Company  and the  success of its  remedial  workover
operations. The Company anticipates that its cash flow will be not sufficient to
fund its  operations  at their  current  levels  and  that  additional  funds or
borrowings  will be required to maintain  current levels of activity.  Under the
Forbearance  Agreement,  the  Company's  Senior  Lender is not  required to make
additional  borrowings  available to the Company,  and as a result, the level of
the Company's operations may be significantly  curtailed.  Because the timing of
acquisitions  of additional  oil and gas  properties  is  uncertain,  additional
borrowings  will be  required to fund new  acquisitions  and the timing of those
borrowings is uncertain.  The Company has obtained certain  unsecured loans from
its  Chairman  and  President,  Jeffrey  T.  Wilson,  which  total in  principal
approximately  $605,083  as of January 31,  2006.  These funds have been used to
initiate the Company's oil and gas and mining  activities  and fund its overhead
requirements. Management believes that the Company may need to borrow additional
funds from these  sources in the future,  if  available,  to fund the  Company's
ongoing needs. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available
from these sources in the future.

At January 31,  2006,  the Company  had current  assets of $575,686  and current
liabilities  of  $20,286,838,  which  resulted  in negative  working  capital of
$19,711,152.   The  negative  working  capital  position  is  comprised  of  the
reclassification  of the Revolving Loan in the amount of $17,316,457 as current,
fees due as a result of the  Forbearance  Agreement of $550,000,  trade accounts
payable  including  accounts of Hillside and Warrior assumed by the Company as a
result of the acquisition of $1,365,464, of accrued expenses payable of $414,170
consisting  primarily of interest and accrued  salaries payable to the Company's
President, notes payable to the Company's President of $605,083, and third party
notes  payable of $85,695.  As of January 31, 2006 the Company had cash and cash
equivalents of $176,435 and accounts receivable of $399,251.

Oil and Gas Hedging

As a requirement  of the financing  commitment,  the Company  purchased  certain
hedging contracts at closing of the Hillside and Warrior  acquisitions  designed
to place a "floor"  price on at least 25% of the Company's  anticipated  monthly
production at a level acceptable to the lender.  The Company purchased one "put"
option  crude oil contract  per month  through  August 2004 at a strike price of
$25.00 Bbl and one "put" option  natural gas contract  through  August 2004 at a
strike price of $4.00 per MMBtu.  The contracts have expired and the Company has
not replaced its hedging agreements.

19

SEASONALITY

The  results  of  operations  of  the  Company  are  seasonal  due  to  seasonal
fluctuations  in the market  prices for crude oil and natural  gas. Due to these
seasonal  fluctuations,  results of operations for individual  quarterly periods
may not be indicative of results, which may be realized on an annual basis.

INFLATION AND PRICES

The  Company's  revenues  and the value of its oil and  natural  gas and  mining
properties  have been and will be  affected  by  changes in the prices for crude
oil,  natural gas and gold prices.  The Company's  ability to obtain  additional
capital on  attractive  terms is also  substantially  dependent  on the price of
these  commodities.  Prices for these  commodities  are  subject to  significant
fluctuations that are beyond the Company's ability to control or predict.

PART II
OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.                      Legal Proceedings.

The  Company  is a named  defendant  in  lawsuits,  is a party  in  governmental
proceedings, and is subject to claims of third parties from time to time arising
in the  ordinary  course of  business.  While the  outcome of  lawsuits or other
proceedings  and claims against the Company cannot be predicted with  certainty,
management  does not expect these matters to have a material  adverse  effect on
the financial position of the Company.

The Company  acquired  certain  accounts  payable  from Warrior in the amount of
$313,607 and Hillside in the amount of $378,861 as a result of the  acquisitions
of the assets of each.  Nearly all of the trade accounts payable were delinquent
when acquired.  During 2005, the Company  completed the settlements with vendors
on these old accounts.

20

The Company has accrued revenue payable in legal and petty suspense  accounts in
the amount of $75,412  and $10,118  respectively  as of January  31,  2006.  The
Company has continued to research owner account information in order to properly
distribute legal suspense accounts in the normal course of business.

The Company has a plugging  liability for oil and gas  operations in the various
states in the amount of $244,148. The Company has plugging bonds posted with the
state  regulatory  agencies  in the  amount of  $77,230  to  offset  the cost of
plugging  wells in the future and a site specific bond in the amount of $415,000
for its Coquille Bay field.

Imperial  Petroleum,  Inc. versus Ravello Capital LLC: The Company filed suit in
Federal District Court in Tulsa County,  Oklahoma against Ravello Capital LLC on
November  20, 2000.  The suit alleged  breach of contract and sought to have the
contract declared partially performed in the amount of 474,900 and sought relief
in the amount of $488,390 for the unpaid  consideration and punitive damages and
attorney  fees.  The Company  received a judgment  award against  Ravello in the
amount of $488,390 and  subsequently  collected and credited the judgment  award
against  Ravello in the amount of $85,638.02 as a result of the  re-issuance  of
certain of its shares in  Warrior,  held by Ravello in escrow and not  released.
The Company does not believe it will be successful in collecting  the balance of
the judgment against Ravello.

The Company,  through its  predecessor  in interest,  was named a defendant in a
class  action  lawsuit   seeking   damages  by  the  plaintiffs  for  inadequate
development  of the Moss Unit located in Panola  county,  Texas.  The plaintiffs
sought  unspecified  damages.  The lawsuit was  settled  subsequent  to year-end
through the  execution of a farmout  agreement  with a company  nominated by the
plaintiffs  to drill  additional  wells in the Unit.  The  Company  retained  an
over-riding  royalty  interest in the farmout wells to be drilled and all rights
to its existing proration unit surrounding the Moss well, as well as $132,500 as
consideration for executing the farmout.  Three additional  producing wells have
subsequently been drilled in the Unit.

The Company,  through its  predecessor  in interest,  was named with others in a
breach of its duties to act as a reasonably  prudent operator in the development
of the Crump Gas Unit in Panola county,  Texas.  The Crump Unit  encompasses the
Company's  Mittie Horton well.  The Plaintiff is seeking a  cancellation  of the
lease for failure to produce  hydrocarbons in paying quantities or alternatively
to  establish a lien  against the  leasehold  to secure  payment of  plaintiff's
damages  resulting  from the  Company's  failure to develop  the  property.  The
damages are  unspecified.  The Company  executed a farmout  agreement with Burke
Royalty,  a co-defendant in the suit,  regarding the acreage in question.  Burke
negotiated  a  settlement  under  which the  Plaintiffs  would  arrange to drill
additional  wells. The Company has a 12.5% carried working interest in the first
well drilled in the unit, proportionately reduced by its 75% working interest in
the  Unit,  and  the  right  to  participate   for  a  12.5%  working   interest
(proportionately reduced) in subsequent wells.

The Company has  received a letter from an attorney  representing  Powder  River
Basin Gas Corp in reference to certain  claims PRVB  believes it has against the
Company and its  management in reference to the sale of PRVB and the  warranties
and  representations  provided by the  Company.  No lawsuit has been filed.  The
Company  believes the claims are without merit and intends to vigorously  defend
any action taken as a result.

establishing and maintaining  disclosure  controls and procedures (as defined in
the Securities Act of 1934 Rules 13a-l4 and 15d-l4) for the registrant and have:

     a)   designed  such  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to ensure  that
          material  information  relating  to  the  registrant,   including  its
          consolidated subsidiaries,  is made known to me by others within those
          entities,  particularly  during  the  period in which  this  quarterly
          report is being prepared;

     b)   evaluated the  effectiveness of the registrant's  disclosure  controls
          and procedures as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing date of
          this quarterly report (the "Evaluation Date"); and

     c)   disclosed  in this  quarterly  report any  change in the  registrant's
          internal  control over financial  reporting  that occurred  during the
          registrant's most recent fiscal quarter that has materially  affected,
          or  is  reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect,  the  registrant's
          internal  control  over  financial  reporting,   to  the  registrant's
          auditors  and  the  audit  committee  of  the  registrant's  board  of
          directors.

5. The Registrant's other certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed,  based on
my most recent evaluation,  to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee
of  registrant's  board of  directors  (or  persons  performing  the  equivalent
functions):

     a)   all  significant  deficiencies  in the design or operation of internal
          controls  which could  adversely  affect the  registrant's  ability to
          record,  process,   summarize  and  report  financial  data  and  have
          identified for the  registrant's  auditors any material  weaknesses in
          internal controls; and

     b)   any fraud, whether or not material,  that involves management or other
          employees who have a  significant  role in the  registrant's  internal
          controls; and
