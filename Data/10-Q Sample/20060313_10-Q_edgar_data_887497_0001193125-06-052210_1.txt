HI-TECH PHARMACAL CO., INC.        NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS        January 31, 2006        BASIS OF PRESENTATION
      The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim
financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial
statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The preparation of the Company s financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles necessarily requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and
the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions. Operating results for the nine month period ended January 31, 2006 are not necessarily indicative of
the results that may be expected for the year ending April 30, 2006. For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto for the year ended April 30, 2005 on Form 10-K.       BUSINESS       Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co., Inc. (the  Company  or
 Hi-Tech ) manufactures and sells prescription and over-the-counter generic drugs, in liquid and semi-solid dosage forms including higher margin prescription products. The Company markets its products in the United States through
distributors, retail drug and mass-merchandise chains and mail order companies. Sales of the Company are seasonal and usually peak between September and March of each year, since a significant portion of the Company s products are
pharmaceutical preparations acting on the human respiratory system.      Net sales for generic pharmaceutical products, which include some private label
contract manufacturing, for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 were $50,756,000, an increase of $9,294,000 or 22%, compared to the fiscal 2005 respective period sales of $41,462,000. The Company s leading generic product for the nine
months ended January 31, 2006 was Sulfamethoxazole with Trimethoprim with net sales of approximately $6,100,000 or 10% of net sales. For the three months ended January 31, 2005 net sales of Sulfamethoxazole with Trimethoprim were
approximately $4,900,000 or 10% of net sales.      The Health Care Products division, which markets the Company s branded products, for the three months
ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 had net sales of $7,237,000 and $6,647,000, respectively, an increase of $590,000 or 9%. Diabetic Tussin          accounted for net sales of approximately $4,100,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005.      Sales of Naprelan          totaled $1,949,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2006, an increase of $13,000 from the nine months ended January 31, 2005.       REVENUE RECOGNITION       Revenue is recognized for product sales upon
shipment and passing of risk to the customer and when estimates of discounts, rebates, promotional adjustments, price adjustments, returns, chargebacks, and other potential adjustments are reasonably determinable, collection is reasonably assured
and the Company has no further performance obligations. These estimates are presented in the financial statements as reductions to net revenues and accounts receivable. The Company has estimated sales returns, allowances and discounts. Contract
research income is recognized as work is completed and as billable costs are incurred. In certain cases, contract research income is based on attainment of designated milestones.       CUSTOMER DEPOSITS AND CONTRACT RESEARCH INCOME       Contract research income is recognized as work is completed and as
billable costs are incurred. In certain cases, contract research income is based on attainment of designated milestones. Advance payments may be received to fund certain development costs.

    NET EARNINGS PER SHARE       Net income per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for basic earnings per share and on the weighted average number of common shares and share equivalents (stock options) outstanding for
diluted earnings per share. For the three months ended January 31, 2005, approximately 410,000 option shares have been excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation as their effect is anti-dilutive. The number of shares outstanding,
per share amounts, common stock and additional paid in capital for all periods has been adjusted to reflect a three for two stock split distributed in January 2006.       INVENTORIES       The components of inventory consist of the following:       
     FIXED ASSETS       The components of net plant and equipment consist of the following:       
     INTANGIBLE ASSETS       The components of net intangible assets are as follows:       

    On July 12, 2005, the Company acquired an interest in Zostrix          brand products for $4,891,000 including $491,000 of closing costs. $4,000,000 was paid
at the closing and $400,000 was payable in four equal quarterly installments commencing October 1, 2005. Such payable in the amount of $200,000 is included in accrued expenses at January 31, 2006. Included in the purchase price is $675,000
which has been placed in escrow, released subject to certain conditions.      On December 30, 2005, the Company acquired the rights to
Tannafed          and Tanafed          DMX from First Horizon Pharmaceutical Corporation for $500,000 and the payment of royalties on future sales.      Intangible assets are stated at cost and amortized using the straight line method over the expected useful lives of the product rights. Amortization expense of the
intangible assets for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 was $455,000 and $215,000, respectively. Amortization expense for the three months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 was $220,000 and $81,000, respectively. Amortization
is included in selling, general and administrative expenses for all periods presented. The Company tests for impairment of intangible assets when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.

    ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES       The components of accounts payable and accrued expenses consist of the following:       
     COMMON STOCK       The Company s Board of Directors has authorized $13,000,000 to repurchase the Company s common stock. Pursuant to the terms of a Rule 10b5-1 stock repurchase plan, these repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market
or in private transactions as market conditions dictate. To date the Company has purchased 1,101,000 shares for $7,946,000. During the nine months ended January 31, 2006 the Company did not repurchase any shares of the Company s common
stock.      On January 11, 2006 the Company distributed a three for two stock split to shareholders of record on December 30, 2005. The number of
shares outstanding, per share amounts, common stock and additional paid in capital for all periods has been adjusted to reflect this three for two stock split.      In November 2005, the Company s shareholders approved an increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Company s employee stock option plan by 750,000 shares.       FREIGHT EXPENSE       Freight costs are included in selling, general, and
administrative expense.       STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION:       Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation , encourages the use of the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation.
Alternatively, SFAS No. 123 allows entities to continue to apply the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board ( APB ) Opinion 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees , and related
interpretations and provide pro forma disclosures of net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share, as if the fair value based method of accounting had been applied to employee awards. The Company has elected to continue to follow the intrinsic
value method in accounting for its stock-based employee compensation arrangements as defined by APB Opinion 25 and provide the disclosures required by SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  
Transition and Disclosure , which was released in December 2002 as an amendment of SFAS No. 123. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition
provisions to stock-based employee compensation.

    CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER MATTERS       The Company s products and facilities are subject to regulation by a number of Federal and State governmental agencies. The Food   Drug Administration ( FDA ), in particular, maintains
oversight of the formulation, manufacture, distribution, packaging and labeling of all of the Company s products.      During the nine months ended
January 31, 2006 the Company s significant customers were McKesson, Cardinal and CVS, which accounted for approximately 18%, 11% and 10% of sales, respectively. At January 31, 2006, trade receivables from these customers were
approximately 48% of total receivables.      The Company has a net investment of approximately $425,000 on January 31, 2006, in Marco Hi-Tech companies
including Marco Hi-Tech JV LLC., a company which develops and markets nutritional supplements and Marco Hi-Tech JV Ltd., a company which is engaged in the development and commercialization of Huperzine A and its analogues for a variety of
degenerative neurological disorders. In 2004, the Company invested approximately $89,000 in a Secured Convertible Note from Marco Hi-Tech JV LLC at an interest rate of 12%, maturing October 1, 2007 which is included in the net investment.
Mr. Reuben Seltzer, brother of David Seltzer and a director of the Company, has an ownership interest in both Marco Hi-Tech entities.      In January
2006, the Company invested $150,000 in Marco Hi-Tech JV Ltd. pursuant to a private placement memorandum, which raised approximately $4,100,000 in gross proceeds from a private offering and closed concurrently with a reverse merger of Marco Hi-Tech
into a public company. This company changed its name to Neuro-Hitech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Neuro-Hitech ). Subsequent to January 31, 2006, Neuro-Hitech began trading on the OTC Bulletin Board under the ticker symbol NHPI.
Mr. Reuben Seltzer is the Chief Executive Officer and a Director of Neuro-Hitech.      In September 2005 the Company invested $100,000 and entered into a
joint venture agreement with XCell Pharmaceutical, LLC ( XCell ). The joint venture is engaged in the development of a solid dosage generic pharmaceutical. Hi-Tech Pharmacal owns 50% of the joint venture and XCell owns the remaining 50%.
XCell is a company engaged in the development of difficult to develop pharmaceutical products. Mr. Reuben Seltzer, Chairman and President of the Company, owns a 50% interest in XCell. Hi-Tech is not obligated under the joint venture agreement
for any additional investment.      On January 18, 2006, Merck   Co., Inc. filed a complaint against the Company in the United States District
Court for the District of New Jersey alleging infringement of its patent for the compounds contained in the solutions under the trademarks TRUSOPT  and COSOPT , used for the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with ocular
hypertension or open-angle glaucoma. The plaintiff seeks a permanent injunction against the Company from engaging in the manufacture and sale of the compounds contained in Merck s patent. The Company filed an answer to the complaint on March 1,
2006. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations in the Complaint. Legal costs in connection with this Complaint are being paid for by a business partner. The Company has no obligation to repay or otherwise issue any credit
to such partner for such legal costs.      On December 18, 2003, Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. filed a complaint against the Company in the United
States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging infringement of its patent for a drug known as Levofloxacin, which it has sublicensed exclusively to Santen Inc. for use in certain ophthalmic pharmaceutical preparations. The plaintiff
seeks a permanent injunction against the Company from engaging in the marketing within the United States of Levofloxacin Opthalmic Solution, described in the Company s new drug application with the United States Food and Drug Administration. On
February 17, 2004, the Company filed an Answer and Counterclaim to the Complaint denying infringement of any valid claim in the patent suit, seeking a judicial declaration that the patent is invalid and not infringed. Fact discovery is complete
and a trial on the remaining unenforceability defense and counterclaim is tentatively scheduled for April 4, 2006. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations in the Complaint. Legal costs in connection with this
complaint are being paid for by a business partner. The Company has no obligation to repay or otherwise issue any credit to such partner for such legal costs.      On or about November 24, 2003 MedPointe Healthcare, Inc. ( MedPointe ) filed a Verified Complaint and Application for Order to Show Cause with Temporary Restraints against the Company in the United States District Court for
the District of New Jersey, Trenton vicinage. The suit alleged willful infringement by the Company of MedPointe s patent No. 6,417,206 as a result of the Company s offering to sell its Tannate 12-D S product, as a generic equivalent
to MedPointe s Tussi-12          D S. On
December 1, 2003 the Court entered Temporary Restraints against the Company pending the return date of the Order to Show Cause. On March 1, 2004 the Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the Company from marketing its Tannate
12-D S product. On November 19, 2004 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the preliminary injunction. As a result of this decision, the Company commenced shipment of the Tannate 12-D S product in the third quarter of fiscal
2005. The Company may still be subject to liability based on a claim of patent infringement for sales of Tannate 12-D S. The case is anticipated to go to trial in the latter part of 2006.

Table of Contents  

   The Company also filed, in May 2000, a complaint against Jame Fine Chemicals, Inc., D/B/A JFC Technologies, Inc. and
MedPointe in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey which has asserted various claims, including claims of breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, tortious interference with current and
prospective contractual relations and for violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Hi-Tech is claiming compensatory damages, which claim is subject to trebling. Hi-Tech is further seeking an award of punitive damages against
MedPointe. Fact discovery in the litigation concluded on August 1, 2005. The case is anticipated to go to trial in the latter part of 2006.      The
Company believes that these litigation matters will not have a material effect on the financial position of the Company.      In December 2004, the Company
learned that the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has been conducting a formal investigation of certain trades in the Company s common stock involving the Company and certain of its officers and directors during
the period commencing on or about April 2003 to at least July 2003. The Company has also learned that the staff is investigating trades involving the Company s common stock by other persons unaffiliated with the Company. The staff has advised
that at this time this is only a fact finding and no conclusion should be reached that the Company or person has violated any law. The Company and its officers and directors have fully cooperated with the SEC in this matter.      From time to time, the Company becomes involved in various legal matters in addition to the above described matters that the Company considers to be in the ordinary
course of business. While the Company is not presently able to determine the potential liability, if any, related to such matters, the Company believes none of such matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on
its financial position.       
  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       With the exception of the
historical information contained in this Form 10-Q, the matters described herein may include forward-looking statements (statements which are not historical facts) made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not promises or guarantees and investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the impact of competitive products and
pricing, product demand and market acceptance, new product development, the regulatory environment, including without limitation, the outcome of the SEC staff s investigation and any conclusions reached by the staff which are adverse to the
Company, its officers or directors, reliance on key strategic alliances, availability of raw materials, fluctuations in operating results and other results and other risks detailed from time to time in the Company s filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. These statements are based on management s current expectations and are naturally subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. We caution you not to place undue reliance upon any such forward looking statements
which speak only as of the date made. Hi-Tech is under no obligation to, and expressly disclaims any such obligation to, update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.   
   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2006 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2005       Net sales for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 were $59,943,000, an increase of $9,900,000 or 20%, as compared to the net sales for the nine months ended
January 31, 2005 of $50,043,000. Net sales of generic pharmaceutical products, which includes some private label contract manufacturing, for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 was $50,756,000, an increase of $9,294,000, approximately
22%, compared to net sales for the nine months ended Januuary 31, 2005 of $41,462,000. The increase is primarily due to products launched in recent quarters which were not sold in the prior period and an increase in sales of Sulfamethoxazole
with Trimethoprim. The Company s leading generic product for the nine months ended January 31, 2006, Sulfamethoxazole with Trimethoprim, had net sales of approximately $6,100,000 or 10% of net sales. For the nine months ended
January 31, 2005 sales of Sulfamethoxazole with Trimethoprim were approximately $4,900,000 or 10% of net sales.      The Health Care Products division,
which markets the Company s branded products, for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 had net sales of $7,238,000 and $6,647,000, respectively, an increase of $591,000 or 9%. This increase is primarily the result of sales of
the newly acquired Zostrix          line of products.
Diabetic Tussin          accounted for net sales of
approximately $4,100,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 and $4,100,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2005.

   Sales of Naprelan          totaled $1,949,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2006, an increase of $14,000 from the nine months ended January 31, 2005. This
increase is primarily due to increased prescription volume of the 375 mg strength under the agreement with Blansett Pharmacal in February 2005. Revenue for this strength is recorded only on the royalty received from our marketing partner.
     Cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 44% or $26,588,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 from $22,793,000, or 46% of
net sales, for the nine months ended January 31, 2005 due to increased sales of higher gross margin products.      Research and product development costs
for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 decreased to $2,264,000, or 4% of net sales, compared to $3,738,000, or 7% of net sales for the same period ended January 31, 2005 due to decreases in expenditures related to the development of
Fluticasone Propionate, a generic version of GlaxoSmithKline s Flonase          in the prior period. The Company currently has 11 products under review at the FDA and 15 projects in active development. Contract research income increased to $27,000 in the fiscal 2006 period compared to $25,000 in
the fiscal 2005 respective period.      Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $17,352,000 from $13,748,000, an increase of $3,604,000 or
29% of net sales from 27% of net sales for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. This was primarily the result of increased legal expense, salary expense and royalties.      Net income for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 was $9,368,000 and $6,410,000, respectively, an increase of $2,958,000, or 46%. The overall increase
is primarily due to the factors noted above.      Fully diluted earnings per share increased 43% to $0.70 per share for the nine months ended January 31,
2006 compared to $0.49 for the nine months ended January 31, 2005.       RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2006 COMPARED TO
THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2005       Net sales for the three months ended January 31, 2006 were $22,897,000, an increase of $1,728,000 or 8% as
compared to the net sales of $21,169,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2005.      Net sales for generic pharmaceutical products, which include
some private label contract manufacturing, for the three months ended January 31, 2006 were $19,240,000, an increase of $1,792,000 or 10%, compared to the fiscal 2005 respective period sales of $17,447,000. The increase is due to strong sales
of products launched in recent quarters which were not sold in the prior period and increased sales of Sulfamethoxazole with Trimethoprim. The Company s leading generic product for the three months ended January 31, 2006, Sulfamethoxazole
with Trimethoprim, had net sales of approximately $1,900,000 or 8% of net sales. For the three months ended January 31, 2005 net sales of Sulfamethoxazole with Trimethoprim were approximately $1,100,000 or 5% of net sales.      The Health Care Products division, which markets the Company s branded products, for the three months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 had net sales of
$2,978,000 and $2,629,000, respectively, an increase of $349,000 or 13%. This increase is the result of sales of the newly acquired Zostrix          line of products. Diabetic Tussin          accounted for net sales of approximately $1,800,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2006 and for the three months ended January 31,
2005.      Sales of Naprelan          totaled $679,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2006, a decrease of $414,000 from the three months ended January 31, 2005. This
decrease is primarily the result of heavier than normal purchases of the 500 mg strength at the end of the second quarter in advance of an announced price increase.      During the quarter ended January 31, 2006 the Company s significant customers were McKesson and CVS, which accounted for approximately 24% and 11% of sales, respectively. At January 31, 2006, trade
receivables from these customers were approximately 45% of total receivables.      Cost of sales decreased to $9,390,000 from $9,521,000, or a decrease of 4%
of net sales to 41% in the three months ended January 31, 2006 from 45% in the three months ended January 31, 2005. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales is due to increased sales of higher margin products.   
  Research and product development costs for the three months ended January 31, 2006 decreased to $684,000, or 3% of net sales compared to $1,071,000 or 5% of net
sales for the same period ended January 31, 2005. The decrease is primarily due to the completion of clinical studies performed in the prior year related to the submission of an ANDA for Fluticasone Propionate, a generic version of
GlaxoSmithKline s Flonase         . Contract research
income in the fiscal 2006 was $27,000 compared to none in the fiscal 2005 period.

   Selling, general and administrative expense increased to $5,669,000 from $5,591,000, a decrease as a percentage of net
sales to 25% from 26% for the three months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005. This was primarily the result of decreased litigation costs, which were partially offset by increased salary expense and advertising expense.      Net income for the three months ended January 31, 2005 and 2004 was $4,897,000 and $3,223,000, respectively, an increase of $1,674,000, or 52%. The overall increase
is primarily due to the factors noted above.      Fully diluted earnings per share increased 44% to $0.36 per share for the three months ended January 31,
2006 compared to $0.25 for the three months ended January 31, 2005.       LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       The Company s operations are historically financed principally by cash flow from operations. At January 31, 2006 and April 30, 2005, working capital was
approximately $64,415,000 and $54,021,000, respectively. The increase of $10,394,000 during the nine months ended January 31, 2006 was primarily due to cash flows from operations and proceeds from the exercise of stock options offset by the
purchase of the interest in Zostrix          brand products
and other intangible assets.      Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $10,682,000 which is primarily due to the net income for the nine
months ended January 31, 2006 of $9,368,000.      Cash flows used in investing activities were approximately $12,228,000 and were principally purchases of
marketable securities, payments for fixed assets acquired and the acquisition of the Zostrix          brand products. Cash flows provided by financing activities were $2,762,000 which was primarily due to the net proceeds from the exercise of stock options.      The Company s $8,000,000 revolving credit facility expired on October 23, 2005. The Company is currently renegotiating a revolving line of credit with its
lender. The terms and amount of the line are expected to be similar to that of the expired credit facility.      On July 12, 2005, the Company acquired
the United States rights to the brands Zostrix          and
Zostrix          HP, topical analgesic creams from Rodlen
Laboratories, Inc. Hi-Tech paid $4,000,000 in cash to Rodlen Laboratories Inc. and was to pay an additional $400,000 installment loan, subject to adjustments in connection with returns of products and customer continuance provisions. As of
January 31, 2006, $200,000 remained outstanding under this agreement. Hi-Tech acquired finished goods and raw material inventory for approximately $400,000. In addition, the Company incurred closing costs in connection with this transaction.
     The Company believes that its financial resources consisting of current working capital and anticipated future operating revenue will be sufficient to
enable it to meet its working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months.       RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS       In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections   A Replacement of APB Option No. 20 and FASB Statement
No. 3.  SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods  financial statements for changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative
effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a change in
non-discretionary profit-sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS No. 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization or depletion method for
long-lived non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2005. The provisions of the statement are effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning May 1, 2006. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of SFAS No. 154 will have a material impact on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.       SEASONALITY       Historically, the months of September through March account for a greater portion of the Company s sales than the other months of the fiscal year. However, this sales pattern can vary significantly depending on the cough, cold and flu
season. Accordingly, period-to-period comparisons within the same fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as indicative of future results.

Table of Contents  

    CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES       In preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses for the reporting period covered thereby. As a result, these estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We base our
estimates and judgments on our historical experience, the terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, information that we obtain from our customers and outside sources, and on various assumptions that we believe to be
reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments which impact our reported operating results and the carrying values of assets and liabilities. These assumptions include but are not limited
to the percentage of new products which may have chargebacks and the percentage of items which will be subject to price decreases. Actual results may differ from these estimates.      Revenue recognition and accounts receivable, adjustments for returns and price adjustments, allowance for doubtful accounts and carrying value of inventory represent significant estimates made by management.
      Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable : Revenue is recognized for product sales upon shipment and when risk is passed to the customer and when
estimates of discounts, rebates, promotional adjustments, price adjustments, returns, chargebacks, and other potential adjustments are reasonably determinable, collection is reasonably assured and the Company has no further performance obligations.
These estimates are presented in the financial statements as reductions to net revenues and accounts receivable. Estimated sales returns, allowances and discounts are provided for in determining net sales. Contract research income is recognized as
work is completed and billable costs are incurred. In certain cases, contract research income is based on attainment of designated milestones.       Adjustments for Returns and Price Adjustments:  Our product revenues are typically subject to agreements with customers allowing chargebacks, rebates, rights of return, pricing adjustments and other allowances. Based on our agreements
and contracts with our customers, we calculate adjustments for these items when we recognize revenue and we book the adjustments against accounts receivable and revenue. Chargebacks, primarily from wholesalers, are the most significant of these
items. Chargebacks result from arrangements we have with end users establishing prices for products for which the end user independently selects a wholesaler from which to purchase. A chargeback represents the difference between our invoice price to
the wholesaler, which is typically stated at wholesale acquisition cost, and the end customer s contract price, which is lower. We credit the wholesaler for purchases by end customers at the lower price. Therefore, we record these chargebacks
at the time we recognize revenue in connection with our sales to wholesalers.      The reserve for chargebacks is computed by analyzing the number of units
sold for the past twenty-four months and the number of units sold through to retailers. The difference represents the inventory which could potentially have chargebacks due to wholesalers. This inventory is multiplied by the historical percentage of
units that are charged back and by the price adjustment per unit to arrive at the chargeback accrual. This calculation is performed by product by customer. The Company currently obtains wholesaler inventory data for the wholesalers which represent
over 95% of our chargeback activity. This data is used to verify the information calculated in the chargeback accrual.      The calculated amount of chargebacks could be affected by other factors such as:       

A change in retail customer mix         

A change in negotiated terms with retailers         

Product sales mix at the wholesaler         

Retail inventory levels         

Changes in Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC)        The Company continually
monitors the chargeback activity and adjusts the provisions for chargebacks when we believe that the actual chargebacks will differ from our original provisions.      Consistent with industry practice, the Company maintains a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period. The Company s estimate for returns is based upon its historical experience with actual
returns. While such experience has allowed for reasonable estimation in the past, history may not always be an accurate indicator of future returns. The Company continually monitors its estimates for returns and makes adjustments when it believes
that actual product returns may differ from the established accruals.         
   13   

Table of Contents  

   Included in the adjustment for sales allowances and returns is a reserve for credits taken by our customers for rebates,
return authorizations and other.      Sales discounts are granted for prompt payment. The reserve for sales discounts is based on invoices outstanding and
assumes that 100% of available discounts will be taken.      Price adjustments, including shelf stock adjustments, are credits issued from time to time to
reflect decreases in the selling prices of our products which our customer has remaining in its inventory at the time of the price reduction. Decreases in our selling prices are discretionary decisions made by us to reflect market conditions.
Amounts recorded for estimated price adjustments are based upon specified terms with direct customers, estimated launch dates of competing products, estimated declines in market price and inventory held by the customer. The Company analyzes this on
a case by case basis and makes adjustments to reserves as necessary.      The Company adequately reserves for chargebacks, discounts, allowances and returns in
the period in which the sales takes place. No material amounts included in the provision for chargebacks and the provision for sales discounts recorded in the current period relate to sales made in the prior periods. The current provision for sales
allowances and returns includes reserves for items sold in the current period, while the ending balance includes reserves for items sold in the current and prior periods. The Company has substantially and consistently used the same estimating
methods. We have refined the methods as new data became available. There have been no material differences between the estimates applied and actual results.      The Company determines amounts that are material to the financial statements in consideration of all relevant circumstances including quantitative and qualitative factors. Among the items considered is the impact on individual financial
statement classification, operating income and footnote disclosures and the degree of precision that is attainable in estimating judgmental items.      The
following table presents the roll forward of each significant estimate as of January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005 and for the nine months then ended, respectively.       
     Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:  We have historically provided credit terms to customers in accordance with
what management views as industry norms. Financial terms for credit-approved customers are generally on either a net 30 or 60 day basis, though most customers are entitled to a prompt payment discount. Management periodically and regularly reviews
customer account activity in order to assess the adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts, considering factors such as economic conditions and each customer s payment history and creditworthiness. If the financial condition of our customers
were to deteriorate, or if they were otherwise unable to make payments in accordance with management s expectations, we would have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts.       Inventories:  We state inventories at the lower of average cost or market, with cost being determined based upon the average method. In evaluating whether inventory is to be stated at cost or market, management
considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand, estimated time required to sell existing inventory and expected market conditions, including levels of competition. We establish reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventories based upon
our historical experience, product expiration dates and management s assessment of current product demand.       Intangible Assets : The
Company s intangible assets consist primarily of acquired product rights. Intangible assets are stated at cost and amortized using the straight line method over the expected useful lives of the product rights. We regularly review the
appropriateness of the useful lives assigned to our product rights taking into consideration potential future changes in the markets for our products. The Company reviews each intangible asset with finite useful lives for impairment by comparing
        
   14   

Table of Contents  

   the undiscounted cash flows of each asset to the respective carrying value. The Company performs this impairment testing
when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the undiscounted cash flows of the asset below its carrying value.       CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS       As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in transactions that
generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of January 31,
2006 we are not involved in any material unconsolidated transactions.       
  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       The Company s $8,000,000 revolving credit facility
expired on October 23, 2005. The Company is currently renegotiating a revolving line of credit with its lender. The terms and amount of the line are expected to be similar to that of the expired credit facility. A new facility will be exposed
to market rate fluctuations which may impact the interest paid on any borrowings under the credit facility. Currently, the Company has no borrowings under any facility; however, an increase in interest rates would impact interest expense on future
borrowings.      The Company invests in U.S. treasury notes, government asset backed securities and corporate bonds, all of which are exposed to interest rate
fluctuations. The interest earned on these investments may vary based on fluctuations in the interest rate.       
  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES       Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management,
including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures within 90 days of the filing date of this quarterly
report, and, based on their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There were no significant changes in our internal controls or in other
factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation.       
  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION        
  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS       On January 18, 2006, Merck   Co., Inc. filed a complaint against the Company in
the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging infringement of its patent for the compounds contained in the solutions under the trademarks TRUSOPT  and COSOPT , used for the treatment of elevated intraocular
pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma. The plaintiff seeks a permanent injunction against the Company from engaging in the manufacture and sale of the compounds contained in Merck s patent. The Company filed an
answer to the complaint on March 1, 2006. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations in the Complaint. Legal costs in connection with this Complaint are being paid for by a business partner. The Company has no
obligation to repay or otherwise issue any credit to such partner for such legal costs.      On December 18, 2003, Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. filed
a complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging infringement of its patent for a drug known as Levofloxacin, which it has sublicensed exclusively to Santen Inc. for use in certain
ophthalmic pharmaceutical preparations. The plaintiff seeks a permanent injunction against the Company from engaging in the marketing within the United States of Levofloxacin Opthalmic Solution, described in the Company s new drug application
with the United States Food and Drug Administration. On February 17, 2004, the Company filed an Answer and Counterclaim to the Complaint denying infringement of any valid claim in the patent suit, seeking a judicial declaration that the patent
is invalid and not infringed. Fact discovery is complete and a trial on the remaining unenforceability defense and counterclaim is tentatively scheduled for April 4, 2006. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations in
the Complaint. Legal costs in connection with this complaint are being paid for by a business partner. The Company has no obligation to repay or otherwise issue any credit to such partner for such legal costs.      On or about November 24, 2003 MedPointe Healthcare, Inc. ( MedPointe ) filed a Verified Complaint and Application for Order to Show Cause with Temporary
Restraints against the Company in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, Trenton vicinage. The suit alleged willful infringement by the Company of MedPointe s patent No. 6,417,206 as a result of the Company s
offering to sell its Tannate 12-D S product, as a generic equivalent to MedPointe s Tussi-12          D S.         
   15   

Table of Contents  

   On December 1, 2003 the Court entered Temporary Restraints against the Company pending the return date of the Order
to Show Cause. On March 1, 2004 the Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the Company from marketing its Tannate 12-D S product. On November 19, 2004 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the preliminary
injunction. As a result of this decision, the Company commenced shipment of the Tannate 12-D S product in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The Company may still be subject to liability based on a claim of patent infringement for sales of Tannate
12-D S. The case is anticipated to go to trial in the latter part of 2006.      The Company also filed, in May 2000, a complaint against Jame Fine Chemicals,
Inc., D/B/A JFC Technologies, Inc. and MedPointe in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey which has asserted various claims, including claims of breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,
tortious interference with current and prospective contractual relations and for violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Hi-Tech is claiming compensatory damages, which claim is subject to trebling. Hi-Tech is further seeking an
award of punitive damages against MedPointe. Fact discovery in the litigation concluded on August 1, 2005. The case is anticipated to go to trial in the latter part of 2006.      The Company believes that these litigation matters will not have a material effect on the financial position of the Company.      In December 2004, the Company learned that the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has been conducting a formal investigation of certain trades in the Company s common stock involving the Company and
certain of its officers and directors during the period commencing on or about April 2003 to at least July 2003. The Company has also learned that the staff is investigating trades involving the Company s common stock by other persons
unaffiliated with the Company. The staff has advised that at this time this is only a fact finding and no conclusion should be reached that the Company or person has violated any law. The Company and its officers and directors have fully cooperated
with the SEC in this matter.      From time to time, the Company becomes involved in various legal matters in addition to the above described matters that the
Company considers to be in the ordinary course of business. While the Company is not presently able to determine the potential liability, if any, related to such matters, the Company believes none of such matters, individually or in the aggregate,
will have a material adverse effect on its financial position.
