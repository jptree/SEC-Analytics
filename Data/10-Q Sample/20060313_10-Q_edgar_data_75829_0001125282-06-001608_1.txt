NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The  condensed consolidated financial information included herein is unaudited. Such  information reflects all adjustments of a normal recurring nature, which are,  in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the Company s  consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the  dates and for the periods presented herein. These condensed consolidated  financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated  financial statements and notes set forth in the Company s Annual Report on Form  10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2005 ( 2005 Form 10-K ). 

Certain  prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year  presentation. 

NOTE 2   STOCK-BASED PAYMENT 

The
    Company currently has four stock-based employee compensation plans (collectively,
    the  Stock Plans ), which are described more fully below under
     the captions Stock Purchase Plans and Stock Option Plans.  Prior to
     August 1, 2005, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation related
     to those Stock Plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of
     Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
     to Employees ( APB No. 25 ), and related  Interpretations, as
     permitted by Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )  Statement
     of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 123, Accounting
     for Stock-Based Compensation ( SFAS No. 123 ).   As such,
     there was no stock-based employee compensation cost recognized in net earnings
     relating to any shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP )
     or stock options granted under any of the existing or terminated stock option
     plans prior to August 1, 2005 whereby stock options were granted with an
     exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant.  There
     was, however, stock-based employee compensation cost recognized in net earnings
     for periods prior to August 1, 2005 resulting from the issuance of restricted
     stock units under the 2005 Stock Compensation Plan ( 2005 Plan )
     and the Management Stock Purchase Plan ( MSPP ). 

Effective  August 1, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of  SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment ( SFAS No. 123(R) ), using the  modified-prospective-transition method.   Under that transition method, compensation cost recognized for the three  and six months ended January 31, 2006 includes: (a) compensation cost for all  share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, August 1,  2005, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the  original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (b) compensation cost for the vested  portion of share-based payments granted subsequent to August 1, 2005, based on  the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS  No. 123(R).  Results for prior periods  have not been restated. 

The
    Company adopted the 2005 Plan (described in more detail below) in contemplation
    of the change in the accounting for share-based payments required by SFAS
    No. 123(R).  Specifically, the 2005 Plan provides the Company with the
    ability to award stock units with various restrictions and vesting requirements. The
    detailed components of stock based compensation expense recorded in the statement
    of earnings for the three and six months ended January 31, 2006 and January
    31, 2005 are
    illustrated
    in
    the table below. 

Stock
    based compensation expense related to stock options and the ESPP for the
    three and six months ended January 31, 2005 was not recorded in the statement
    of earnings, but had been disclosed in the pro forma disclosures as required
    by SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148. The
    following table illustrates the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) on August
    1, 2005 on the Company s
earnings before income taxes, net earnings and earnings per share (which excludes
    the effect of certain changes to the Company s stock plans under the
    2005 plan such as the restricted stock units granted in contemplation of
    the change in accounting):

(Unaudited)  

SFAS
    No. 123(R) also requires that excess tax benefits related to stock option
    exercises be reflected as financing cash inflows.  For
    the six months ended January 31, 2006, this treatment resulted in cash flows
    from financing activities of $308. The tax benefit recognized related to
    the total compensation cost for share-based payment arrangements totaled
    $533 and $1,020 for the three and six months ended January 31, 2006, respectively,
    and totaled $43 and $86 for the three and six months ended January 31, 2005,
    respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from
    option exercise of
    the share-based
    payment
    arrangements totaled $3,293 and $4,905 for the three and six months ended
January 31, 2006, respectively. 

The  following table illustrates the effect on net earnings and earnings per share  for the three and six months ended January 31, 2005 as if the Company had  applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to options  granted under the Company s stock plans prior to adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on  August 1, 2005.  No pro forma disclosure  has been made for periods subsequent to August 1, 2005 as all stock-based  compensation has been recognized in net earnings.  For purposes of this pro forma disclosure and compensation cost  recorded in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements, the  value of the options is estimated using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing  formula and amortized to expense over the options  service periods. 

The
    following weighted average assumptions were used in estimating the fair value
    of stock options granted during the three and six months ended January 31,
    2006 and January 31, 2005: 

The  Company has placed exclusive reliance on historical volatility in its estimate  of expected volatility.  The Company  used a sequential period of historical data equal to the expected term (or  expected life) of the options using a simple average calculation based upon the  daily closing prices of the aforementioned period.   

The  expected life (years) represents the period of time for which the options  granted are expected to be outstanding.   This estimate was derived from historical share option exercise  experience, which management believes provides the best estimate of the  expected term.

(Unaudited)  

As  noted above, the following paragraphs describe each of the aforementioned  stock-based compensation plans in detail: 

Stock  Purchase Plans 

During  fiscal year 2000, the Company s shareholders approved two stock purchase plans,  the MSPP and the ESPP. Participation in the MSPP is limited to certain  executives as designated by the Compensation Committee of the Board of  Directors, which also established common stock ownership targets for  participants. Participation in the ESPP is available to all employees except  those that are included in the MSPP.   

The
    purpose of the MSPP is to encourage key employees of the Company to increase
    their ownership of shares of the Company s common stock by providing
    such employees with an opportunity to elect to have portions of their total
    annual compensation paid in the form of restricted units, to make cash purchases
    of restricted units and to earn additional matching restricted units which
    vest over a three year period for matches prior to August 1, 2003 and vest
    over four years for matches made thereafter. Such restricted units aggregated
    780 and 619 as of January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005, respectively. For
    the three months ended January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005, approximately
    32 and 28 vested restricted units, respectively, were distributed. For the
    six months ended January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005, approximately 58
    and 65 vested restricted units, respectively, were distributed. For the three
    months ended January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005, participants  deferred
    compensation and cash payments amounted to $439 and $696, respectively. For
    the six months ended January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005, participants  deferred
    compensation and cash payments amounted to $3,165 and $2,260, respectively.  Dividends
    are paid on unvested restricted units (in the form of additional restricted
    units) and vest over the remaining service period of the restricted units
    for which the dividends were recorded.  Dividends are paid on vested
    restricted units (in the form of additional restricted units) and are vested
    upon grant. 

The  ESPP enables participants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock  through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the market  price at the beginning or end of each semi-annual stock purchase period. The  semi-annual offering periods end in April and October.  A total of 207 shares were purchased under  the ESPP for the semi-annual stock purchase period ended October 31, 2005.  Shares for the current semi-annual stock  purchase period will be purchased on April 28, 2006, the end of the  aforementioned current stock purchase period. 

Both  plans provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control (as  defined in the plans).  All of the above shares were issued from  treasury stock. 

Stock  Option Plans 

The  Company has adopted several plans that provide for the granting of stock  options to employees and non-employee directors at option prices equal to the  market price of the common stock at the date of grant.  On November 17, 2004, the Company s  shareholders approved the 2005 Plan, which had been developed in contemplation  of adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R).   As a result of such approval, the Compensation Committee (a) amended the  2001 Stock Option Plan for non-employee directors to reduce the total number of  shares remaining available for grants from 261 to 150, and (b) terminated all  other stock plans, except that options then outstanding thereunder remained in  effect in accordance with their terms.   Up to 5,000 shares are issuable under the 2005 Plan.  Both plans provide for accelerated vesting  if there is a change in control (as defined in the plans).
  The 2005 Plan permits the Company to grant  to its employees and non-employee directors other forms of equity compensation  in addition to stock options (that is, restricted shares, restricted units,  performance shares and performance units). 

The  fair value of the restricted unit awards are determined by reference to the  closing price of the stock on the date of the award, and are charged to  earnings over the service periods during which the awards are deemed to be  earned; one year, in the case of the annual award units to non-employee directors,  and four years, in the case of units awarded to employees.  The annual award units granted to  non-employee directors of the Company (and any related dividends paid in the  form of additional units) are converted to shares once the director ceases to  be a member of the Board.  A total of 14  annual award units were granted during the six months ended January 31, 2006,  with a weighted-average fair market value of $27.89 per share. Restricted stock  units granted to employees cliff-vest after the fourth anniversary of the date  of grant.  Dividends paid on unvested  restricted stock

units vest at the same time as the restricted units for which  the dividends were recorded.

(Unaudited)  

The
    forms of options adopted provide that the options may not be exercised within
    one year from the date of grant, and expire if not completely exercised within
    7 years from the date of grant. Generally, in any year after the first year,
    the options can be exercised with respect to only up to 25% of the shares
    subject
to the option, computed cumulatively. The Company s shareholders have  approved
all of the Company s stock option plans. 

A
    summary of option activity for all stock option plans during the six months
ended January 31, 2006 is presented below: 

The
    total intrinsic value of options exercised during the three and six months
ended January 31, 2006 was $2,308 and $3,419, respectively.  The total intrinsic value of options  exercised during the three and six months ended January 31, 2005 was $8,773 and  $8,185, respectively. 

A
    summary of restricted stock unit activity, excluding annual award units,
    for the 2005 Stock Plan during the six
months ended January 31, 2006, is presented below: 

As of January 31, 2006, there was $8,159 of  total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based  compensation arrangements granted under the 2005 Stock Plan.  That cost is expected to be recognized over  a weighted-average period of 3.5 years.   None of the restricted stock units vested during the six months ended  January 31, 2006. 

As  of January 31, 2006, 5,204 shares of common stock of the Company were reserved  for the exercise of stock options and stock units. To the extent treasury  shares are used to satisfy option exercises, these reserved shares will not be  issued.

NOTE  3   ACQUISITIONS 

On  November 30, 2004, the Company acquired the BioSepra Process Division  ( Biosepra ) from Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc.   The purchase price was approximately $32,000, net of cash and debt  assumed, subject to a post closing adjustment of the purchase price based upon  certain quantitative thresholds as defined in the purchase agreement.  The adjustment to the purchase price was  finalized on April 11, 2005, resulting in a reduction in the purchase price of  approximately $1,100.  Biosepra  develops, manufactures and markets chromatography sorbents for use in the  purification of protein in drug development and production.   

On  January 21, 2005, the Company acquired the remaining interest in Euroflow (UK)  of Stroud, England ( Euroflow ) which it did not already own. The purchase  price was $1,466, net of cash. Euroflow manufactures pilot and production scale  chromatography columns for the biotechnology industry. The Company has held  exclusive global marketing and distribution rights to Euroflow chromatography  columns and associated technologies since 2002. In addition, the Company had  loans and advances totaling $9,255 outstanding from Euroflow at the date of  acquisition. 

The  acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in  accordance with SFAS No. 141. SFAS No. 141 requires that the total cost of the  acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and  liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of  acquisition. The January 31, 2006 condensed consolidated balance sheet reflects  the final allocation of the purchase prices and non-deductible goodwill of  $9,900 related to these acquisitions. The following table summarizes the final  allocation of the purchase prices to the assets acquired and liabilities  assumed at the dates of the acquisitions: 

Based  upon the markets Biosepra and Euroflow serve, the goodwill was assigned to the  Company s BioPharmaceutical segment. Pro forma financial information related to  the acquisitions has not been provided, as it is not material to the Company s  results of operations and cash flows. 

NOTE 4   DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT 

On  December 16, 2005, the Company and Satair A/S ( Satair ) signed an agreement  whereby Satair acquired the exclusive rights to the Western Hemisphere commercial  aerospace aftermarket distribution channel for the Company s products for a  ten-year period.  The transaction was  valued at $22,000, of which $19,000 was paid to the Company in cash on the  closing date, and $3,000 in a five-year non-interest bearing note receivable,  payable in equal installments.  In  addition, the agreement required Satair to purchase certain finished goods  inventory from the

Company  valued at $5,683.  The
    $22,000 in cash and notes receivable received for the distribution rights
    were recorded as deferred revenue and will be amortized as an increase to
    sales over the life of the distribution agreement. 

NOTE  5   BALANCE SHEET DETAILS 

The  following tables provide details of selected balance sheet items: 

Unbilled  receivables principally relate to long-term contracts recorded under the  percentage-of-completion method of accounting. 

NOTE 6   GOODWILL AND  INTANGIBLE ASSETS 

The  following table presents goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, allocated  by reportable segment in accordance with SFAS No. 142: 

The  change in the carrying amount of goodwill is primarily attributable to the  changes in the final allocation of goodwill from the acquisition of Euroflow as  discussed in Note 3 and to the changes in foreign exchange rates used to  translate the goodwill contained in the financial statements of foreign  subsidiaries using the rates at each respective balance sheet date.

(Unaudited)  

Intangible assets, net, consist  of the following: 

The  increase in patents and unpatented technology is due to the finalization of the  valuation of intangible assets purchased in the Euroflow acquisition.  The fair value of these intangibles had not  been determined as of July 31, 2005.  As  such, their cost had been preliminarily allocated based upon their book values. 

Amortization  expense for these intangible assets for the three and six months ended January  31, 2006 was $2,594 and $4,402, respectively. Amortization expense for these  intangible assets for the three and six months ended January 31, 2005 was  $1,486 and $2,959, respectively.   Amortization expense is estimated to be approximately $4,111 for the  remainder of fiscal 2006, $8,130 in 2007, $7,159 in 2008, $6,703 in 2009,  $6,643 in 2010 and $6,663 in 2011. 

NOTE 7   TREASURY STOCK  

On  October 17, 2003, the Board authorized the expenditure of up to $200,000 to  repurchase shares of the Company s common stock. On October 14, 2004, the Board  authorized the additional expenditure of up to another $200,000 for the  repurchase of the Company s common stock. The Company s shares may be purchased  over time, as market and business conditions warrant. There is no time  restriction on these authorizations. During the six months ended January 31,  2006, the Company purchased 187 shares in open-market transactions at an  aggregate cost of $5,750 with an average price per share of $30.81. As of  January 31, 2006, $255,004 remains available to be expended under the current  stock repurchase programs. Repurchased shares are held in treasury for use in  connection with the Company s stock-based compensation plans and for general  corporate purposes. 

During  the six months ended January 31, 2006, 625 shares were issued under the  Company s stock-based compensation plans. At January 31, 2006, the Company held  3,178 treasury shares. 

NOTE 8   CONTINGENCIES AND  COMMITMENTS 

The  Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet at January 31, 2006 includes  liabilities for environmental matters of approximately $21,778, which relates  mainly to the previously reported environmental proceedings involving a Company  subsidiary, Gelman Sciences Inc. pertaining to groundwater contamination.  In the opinion of management, the Company is  in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and its current  accruals for environmental remediation are adequate. However, because  regulatory standards under environmental laws are becoming increasingly  stringent, there can be no assurance that future developments, additional  information and experience gained will not cause the Company to incur material  environmental liabilities or costs beyond those accrued in its condensed  consolidated financial statements.

Furthermore, the Company    completed the sale begun in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 of certain    manufacturing plants in Germany acquired as part of the FSG acquisition,    which resulted in the recognition of a gain of $387. 

During the six months    ended January 31, 2006, the Company continued its realignment plan and cost    reduction initiatives. As a result, the Company recorded severance    liabilities for the termination of certain employees worldwide as well as    other costs related to these initiatives. 

(2) Other (Gains)/Charges: 

(a) 

The Company recorded a    charge of $2,875 in the three months ended October 31, 2004 for the    other-than-temporary diminution in value of its investment in Panacos    Pharmaceuticals, Inc., formerly known as V.I. Technologies, Inc. ( VITEX ). 

In August 2005, the    Company sold all of the 617.5 shares it held of VITEX for total    proceeds aggregating $6,783.  The cost    basis at the time of the sale, as adjusted by previous impairment charges,    was $4,940.  As a result, the Company    recorded a gain of $1,806, net of fees and commissions in the three months    ended October 31, 2005. 

On January    13, 2006 the Company sold its stock rights in Satair for total proceeds    aggregating $641. The cost basis of the rights at the time of the sale was    $247. As a result, the Company recorded a gain of $394 in the three months    ended January 31, 2006. 

(b) 

In the three months ended    January 31, 2005, the Company increased a previously established    environmental reserve by $502 related to the environmental matter in Pinellas    Park, Florida. 

The  following table summarizes the activity related to restructuring liabilities  that were recorded in fiscal years 2006 and 2005:

NOTE 10   COMPONENTS OF NET  PERIODIC PENSION COST  

The  Company provides substantially all domestic and foreign employees with  retirement benefits. Net periodic pension benefit cost for the Company s  defined benefit pension plans includes the following components: 

NOTE 11   EARNINGS PER SHARE 

The  condensed consolidated statements of earnings present basic and diluted  earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is determined by dividing income  available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common  shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share considers the  potential effect of dilution on basic earnings per share assuming potentially  dilutive shares, such as those issuable upon exercise of stock options that  meet certain criteria, were outstanding. The treasury stock method reduces the  dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities as it assumes that cash  proceeds (from the issuance of potentially dilutive securities) are used to buy  back shares at the average share price during the period.  Employee stock options and units of 890 and  27 shares were not included in the computation of diluted shares for the three  months ended January 31, 2006

and January 31, 2005, respectively, because their  effect would have been antidilutive. For the six months ended January 31, 2006  and January 31, 2005, 906 and 193 antidilutive shares were excluded.

(a) 

Included in    restructuring and other charges, net, for the purposes of evaluation of    segment and geographic profitability is a charge of $195 and $506 in the    three and six months ended January 31, 2006, respectively, related to a    purchase accounting adjustment to step up the value of inventory acquired    from Biosepra by $2,431, in accordance with SFAS No. 141, in the opening    balance sheet. This step up increased cost of sales by $195 and $506 in the    three and six months ended January 31, 2006 concurrent with the sale of a    portion of the underlying inventory. The step up amount is excluded from    operating profit since management considers it non-recurring in nature    because, although the Company acquired the manufacturing operations of    Biosepra, this adjustment was required by SFAS 141 as an elimination of the    manufacturing profit in inventory acquired from Biosepra and subsequently    sold in the period.

ITEM  2.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  OF FINANCIAL CONDITION    

AND  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.   

Forward-Looking  Statements and Risk Factors  

You  should read the following discussion together with the condensed consolidated  financial statements and notes thereto and other financial information in this  Form 10-Q and in Pall s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended  July 31, 2005.  The discussions under  the subheadings  Review of Market Segments and Geographies  below are in local  currency unless indicated otherwise. The Company considers local currency  growth an important measure because by excluding the volatility of exchange  rates, underlying volume growth is clearer. As used below,   %  indicates that  the Company has rounded the relevant data up or down to the nearest one-half  percentage point. Dollar amounts discussed below are in thousands, unless  otherwise indicated, except per share dollar amounts. In addition, per share  dollar amounts are discussed on a diluted basis. 

The  matters discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contain   forward-looking statements  as defined in the Private Securities Litigation  Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on current Company management  expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause  actual results to differ materially. The Company is subject to risks and  uncertainties including, but not limited to: fluctuations in foreign currency  exchange rates; regulatory approval and market acceptance of new technologies;  changes in product mix and product pricing and in interest rates and cost of  raw materials; the Company s success in enforcing its patents and protecting  its proprietary products and manufacturing techniques and its ability to  achieve the savings anticipated from its cost reduction initiatives; global and  regional economic conditions and legislative, regulatory and

political  developments; and domestic and international competition in the Company s  global markets.   

Results  of Operations   

Review of Consolidated Results  

Sales  in the quarter increased 2% to $478,436 from $469,473 in the second quarter of  fiscal year 2005. For the six months, sales increased 3% to $909,598. Exchange  rates reduced reported sales in the quarter and six months by $25,215 and  $27,060, respectively, primarily due to the weakening Euro, British Pound and  Yen, partly offset by the strengthening of certain other Asian currencies. In  local currency (i.e., had exchange rates not changed year over year), sales  increased 7 % and 6% in the quarter and six months, respectively. Overall,  pricing reduced sales by  % in both the quarter and six months, and as such,  the overall volume increase was 8% and 6 %, respectively. The recent  strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the major currencies in which the  Company operates, if sustained through fiscal 2006, will negatively affect  reported sales and net earnings. 

Sales
    in the Aerospace segment increased 12% in local currency in both the quarter
    and six months primarily driven by incremental sales related to the Company s
    expanded relationship and agreement with Satair A/S ( Satair ).
    Refer to discussion below for further details on the Satair agreement. General
    Industrial sales were up 5 % in the quarter and 5% in the six months,
    with all submarkets contributing to this growth, with the exception of Municipal
    Water. Microelectronics sales were up 17% in the quarter and 11% in the six
    months fueled by growth in the display and data storage markets. Sales in
    the BioPharmaceuticals segment increased 10 % and 8% in the quarter
    and six months, respectively, driven by strong growth in consumables. Sales
    in the Medical segment were up slightly in the quarter and six months, as
    good growth in the BioSciences portion of the business was offset by shortfalls
    in the Blood Filtration sector. By geography, local currency sales in Asia
    were up 8% and 10% in the quarter and six months, respectively, with particularly
    strong growth seen in the Microelectronics segment. In Europe, sales increased
    8% and 5 % in the quarter and six months, respectively, with all segments
    contributing to this growth. In the Western Hemisphere sales grew 6% in the
    quarter and 4% in the six months, with all segments contributing to these
    gains with the exception of Medical. The Company expects overall sales in
    local currency to grow in the mid single-digit range for the full fiscal
    year 2006 compared with fiscal year 2005. For a detailed discussion of sales,
    refer to  Review of  Market Segments and Geographies.  

Cost
    of sales in the quarter, as a percentage of sales, increased to 52.8% from
    52.1% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, reflecting the impact of
    pricing reductions in the Medical business and a one-time purchase accounting
    adjustment related to inventory acquired as part of the Biosepra acquisition.
    In addition, cost of sales was negatively impacted by stock compensation
    and the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)  Share-Based Payment  ( SFAS
    No. 123(R) ) as  well as transition costs related to the Company s
    facility rationalization initiative. These factors were partly offset by
    savings generated from the Company s
    cost reduction initiatives. For the six months, cost of sales, as a percentage
    of sales, increased to 53% from 52%, reflecting the factors discussed above
    as well as the impact of several low margin Industrial system sales and facility

 and equipment refurbishments in certain Life Sciences  plants. The  transitional
    costs related to the facilities rationalization will continue over the second
    half of fiscal year 2006 and into fiscal year 2007 as the Company makes progress
    on this initiative. Based on these factors combined with the very high level
    of systems business expected in the second half of this fiscal year, the
    Company expects cost of sales, as a percentage of sales, for the full fiscal
    year 2006 to be slightly higher than fiscal year 2005.

Selling,
    general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, improved to
    33.3% from 33.6% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005. For the six months,
    selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, improved
    to 34.0% from 34.3%.  The  improvement in the quarter and six months
    reflects savings realized from the Company s cost reduction initiatives
    partly offset by the impact of stock compensation and the adoption of SFAS
    No. 123(R), which negatively impacted selling, general and administrative
    expenses by 48 basis points in the quarter and six months. The Company continued
    to move forward with its cost reduction programs. Concerning
 the Company s cost reduction initiatives, the Company is making progress
 on the first phase of its facilities rationalization initiative involving seven
 manufacturing facilities.  Additionally,  the Company has launched a major
 initiative to optimize its European operations with the objective of delivering
 improvements in profitability. The Company s
 expectation is that it will see some operational cost improvements later this
 fiscal year with more substantial improvements in fiscal years 2007 and 2008
 related to these two initiatives. Based on these factors, the Company is expecting
 continued improvement in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a
 percentage of sales, for the full fiscal year 2006 compared with fiscal year
 2005. 

Research  and development expenses were $14,398 compared to $13,907 in the second quarter  of fiscal year 2005. As a percentage of sales, research and development  expenses were 3%, on par with last year. For the six months, research and  development expenses were $27,464, or 3% of sales compared to $27,620, or 3.1%  of sales for the six months of fiscal year 2005. The Company expects research  and development expenses in dollars to increase moderately through fiscal year  2006 compared with fiscal year 2005. 

In  the second quarter and six months of fiscal year 2006, the Company recorded  restructuring and other charges, net, of $3,736 and $3,686, respectively. The  restructuring and other charges, net is comprised of severance and other costs  in connection with the Company s on-going cost reduction programs and  divisional realignment, partly offset by the reversal of excess restructuring  reserves recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings in fiscal year  2005. In addition, restructuring and other charges, net, includes a gain on the  sale of the Company s stock rights in Satair, which was recorded in the second  quarter, as well as a gain on the sale of the Company s investment in Panacos  Pharmaceuticals, Inc., formerly known as V.I. Technologies, Inc. ( VITEX ),  that was recorded in the first quarter. In the second quarter and six months of  fiscal year 2005, the Company

recorded restructuring and other charges, net, of  $5,438 and $10,961, respectively, primarily related to the Company s cost  reduction programs and divisional realignment. In addition, the charges include  an increase of $502 in the second quarter to a previously established  environmental reserve and the write-down in the first quarter of the Company s  investment in VITEX that was deemed other-than-temporarily impaired.  

The  details of the charges for the quarter and six months ended January 31, 2006  and January 31, 2005 can be found in the Restructuring and Other Charges note  accompanying the condensed consolidated financial statements.

The  following table summarizes the activity related to restructuring liabilities  that were recorded in fiscal years 2006 and 2005: 

Amounts reflected as severance  liabilities for fiscal year 2006 exclude $227 related to non-cash stock  compensation.

Other    changes reflect translation impact.

Reflects the    reversal of excess restructuring reserves recorded in the consolidated    statements of earnings in fiscal year 2005. 

Net  interest expense in the quarter decreased to $5,642 from $6,146 in the second  quarter of fiscal year 2005.  For the  six months, net interest expense decreased to $11,381 from $11,853. The decrease  in net interest expense in the quarter and six months primarily reflects the  impact of lower debt levels. The Company expects net interest expense for the  full fiscal year 2006 to decrease approximately $2,000-$3,000 compared with  fiscal year 2005.  

The
    underlying tax rate (i.e., the tax rate on earnings before income taxes,
    excluding restructuring and other charges) was 24% in the quarter
    and six months, unchanged from the second quarter and six months of fiscal
    year 2005.  However, due to the interim  period income tax provisions
    of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company s tax rate may  vary quarter to quarter
    based on the deductibility of the stock compensation expense recorded in
    the interim period. The impact of stock compensation and the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R) impacted the Company s tax rate by 0.44% and  0.50%
    in the second quarter and six months, respectively.  However, based
    upon estimates of the timing of the subject deductibility throughout the
    year, the Company estimates that it will have no impact on its full year
    tax rate and continues to expect that its underlying tax rate will remain
    at 24% for the full fiscal year 2006.  

Net earnings in the quarter  were $32,436, or 26 cents per share, compared with net earnings of $32,045, or  26 cents per share in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005. For the six  months, net earnings were $57,546, or 46 cents per share, compared with net  earnings of $53,744, or 43 cents per share.    In summary, net earnings for the quarter and six months reflect organic  sales growth, an improvement in selling, general and administrative expenses,  as a percentage of sales, and a decrease in net interest expense partly offset  by the impact of lower gross margins. In addition, net earnings reflect  restructuring and other charges, net of $3,736 in the quarter ($3,686 for the  six months) compared to $5,438 in the quarter ($10,961 for the six months) in  fiscal year 2005. The impact of stock compensation and the adoption of SFAS No.  123(R), negatively impacted earnings per share by 2 cents

in the quarter and 4  cents in the six months. The Company estimates that foreign currency  translation reduced earnings per share by approximately 1 cent in both the  quarter and six months.  

On
December 16, 2005, the Company and Satair signed an agreement  whereby Satair
    acquired the exclusive rights to the Western Hemisphere commercial aerospace
aftermarket distribution channel for the Company s  products for a ten-year
period.  The  transaction was valued at $22,000, of which $19,000 was paid
to the Company in cash on the closing date, and $3,000 in a five-year non-interest
bearing note receivable, payable in equal installments.   In addition, the
agreement required Satair to purchase certain finished goods inventory from the 

21 

Back to Contents   

Company valued at $5,683.  The
      $22,000 in cash and notes receivable received for the distribution rights
      were recorded as deferred revenue and will be amortized as an increase to
      sales over the life of the distribution agreement.  It is expected
      that the impact of the transaction will be accretive to earnings in fiscal
      year
  2006 as well as future years.  

The  Company expects earnings per share for the full fiscal year 2006 to be in the  range of $1.29 - $1.44 per share including restructuring and other charges, net  for the six months ended January 31, 2006. This range includes the impact of  stock compensation and the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), which the Company  estimates will cost approximately 8 cents in earnings per share. In light of  its ongoing cost reduction initiatives, the Company may incur severance and  other restructuring costs over the second half of fiscal year 2006; however,  because these costs are not estimable at this time, this range does not  contemplate such charges. 

Review of Market Segments and Geographies   

Market Segments:   

The table below presents sales  for the quarter and six months ended January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005 by  market segment, including the effect of exchange rates for comparative  purposes.  

Life  Sciences sales increased 5% and 3 % in the quarter and six months,  respectively, compared to the same periods in fiscal year 2005. Life Sciences  represented approximately 39% of total sales in the quarter and six months on  par with the same periods of fiscal year 2005. 

Within  Life Sciences, Medical segment sales were up 1 % in the quarter and 1% in the  six months, as growth in the BioSciences portion of the business was offset by  shortfalls in the Blood Filtration sector. By geography, Medical sales in  Europe were up a modest 3 % in the quarter while in Asia, the smallest of the  Company s Medical markets, sales were up 16%. Sales in the Western Hemisphere,  the largest of the Company s Medical markets, were down 3%. A similar trend was  evident by geography for the six months. 

Within
    Medical, sales in the BioSciences submarket increased 4% and 6% in the quarter
    and six months, respectively, driven by double-digit growth in the Laboratory
    portion of the business. The growth in Laboratory sales was driven by increased
    sales of core products, the continued success of the Company s disposable
    sample preparation products and the success of the Company s VWR partnership.
    Sales in the OEM portion of the business were down 3 % in the quarter
    due to timing of orders and up 1 % for the six months. By geography,
    BioSciences sales growth in the quarter was fueled by Europe (+11%) and Asia
    (+7%), while sales in the Western Hemisphere were up slightly. For the six
    months, the BioSciences sales growth was driven by double-digit growth in
    both Europe and Asia, while sales in the Western Hemisphere were up slightly. 

22 

Back to Contents   

Sales
    in the Blood Filtration submarket were down 1% and 2% in the quarter and
    six months, respectively, reflecting shortfalls in the Western Hemisphere.
    Sales in the Western Hemisphere (which accounts for approximately 65% of
    the Company s  global Blood Filtration business) were down 6% in the
    quarter and 5 % in the  six months. The shortfall in the Western Hemisphere
    reflects reduced pricing related to new long-term contracts in place. Blood
    Filtration sales in Europe increased 2% in the quarter, however, were down
    1 % for the six months. In Asia  (the smallest of the Company s
    Blood Filtration markets), sales were up 26% in the quarter (+21% for the
    six months). Sales in the Hospital submarket increased 3 % reflecting
    growth in the Western Hemisphere and Asia. Sales in Europe (the largest of
    the Company s Hospital markets) were down slightly. For  the six months,
    sales in the Hospital submarket were down slightly. The Company s Acrodose
    Pooled Platelet System recently received clearance in the U.S. from the Food
    and Drug Administration ( FDA ), which should have a  positive
    impact on blood center sales in fiscal year 2007. The Company s  Leukotrap
    Affinity prion product continues to demonstrate excellent results under  customer
    validation studies in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Company s
    Aquasafe water filtration systems are starting to make inroads into the hospital
    market in the Western Hemisphere and Europe s Aquasafe position continues
    to be strong. Overall, the Company expects sales in the Medical segment to
    be up modestly for the full fiscal year 2006. 

BioPharmaceuticals
    segment sales increased 10 % in the quarter and 8% for the six months,
    driven by strong growth in consumables in all geographies. System sales were
    down 59 %  and 53 % in the quarter and six months, respectively,
    reflecting the typical lumpiness of such sales. By geography, the growth
    in BioPharmaceuticals was driven by the Western Hemisphere where sales increased
    19 % in the quarter and  10% in the six months. In Europe, sales grew
    8% in the quarter (+8 % for the  six months), while in Asia, sales increased
    in the low single-digit range in both periods. The growth in consumables
    in the quarter and six months was across most market sectors, especially
    Biotechnology, Vaccine and Plasma products. New generation sterile filter
    cartridges, capsules and single use processing systems all made significant
    contributions to growth. The Company expects that these trends will continue
    throughout the remainder of fiscal year 2006. The Company s chromatography
    business continues to grow aided by the acquisition of Euroflow and the Company
    is seeing signs that this has also had a positive impact on its BioSepra
    sorbent business. Overall, orders were strong in the quarter and six months,
    increasing 23% and 14 %, respectively. Systems  comprised the majority
    of these orders, however, they also include large contracts for BioSepra
    sorbents and new filter formats based on the Company s  Ultipleat technology.
    The Company expects sales in the BioPharmaceuticals segment to increase in
    the double-digit range for the full fiscal year 2006. 

Industrial  sales grew 9% in the quarter and 7 % for the six months, with all segments  contributing to this growth.  The  Company s Industrial business accounted for approximately 61% of total sales in  the quarter and six months on par with the same periods of fiscal year 2005.  

General  Industrial segment sales, which account for about 63% of the Company s  Industrial business, were up 5 % in the quarter and 5% in the six months  compared with the same periods of fiscal year 2005. The increase in sales in  the General Industrial segment reflects growth in all of the submarkets with  the exception of Municipal Water. 

Within
    General Industrial, sales in the Fuels   Chemicals submarket grew 18 %
    and 12 % in the quarter and six months, respectively, driven by strong
    sales of consumables. The consumables business has been very strong over
    the past eighteen months stemming in part from the start up and operation
    of many systems installations. System sales, which are often lumpy quarter-to-quarter,
    increased 17% in the quarter, however, decreased 15 % in the six months.
    The refining, petrochemical, chemical and plastics markets remain healthy
    despite increased energy prices. Additionally, the general health of the
    oil and gas sector is driving growth in this market. By geography, sales
    in Europe were very strong increasing 39% in the quarter and 19 % for
    the six months.  Sales in the Western Hemisphere grew 19 % in
    the quarter (+10 % for the six months). In Asia, sales were down slightly
    in the quarter, however for the six months, sales were up 6%. Overall, orders
    growth was strong in the quarter (+39 %) and six months (+35%). Sales
    in the Power Generation submarket increased 1% in the quarter and 3% in the
    six months as growth in Asia and the Western Hemisphere were largely offset
    by shortfalls in Europe. Sales in the Machinery   Equipment submarket
    were up slightly (+1%) in the quarter as growth in Europe (+7 %) and
    Asia (+6 %) was offset by a  shortfall in the Western Hemisphere (-16%).
    The shortfall in the Western Hemisphere reflects continued pressure in the
    pulp and paper markets. In the six months, sales in the Machinery   Equipment
    submarket increased 4 % as  growth in Europe (+6 %) and Asia (+17 %)
    was partly offset by a shortfall in the Western Hemisphere (-9%). Paper production will continue to
    face challenges as demand for printed material slows, however, overall growth
    in primary metals, automobile production and mining (all industries experiencing
    average to above average organic growth) remains healthy. The Company is
    refocusing on higher growth markets and expanding its efforts in underdeveloped
    regions including Latin America, Eastern Europe and China. Food and Beverage
    sales increased 6% in the quarter driven by strong growth in the Western
    Hemisphere, where sales increased 88 %. Shortfalls in Europe (the Company s
    largest Food   Beverage market) and Asia of 4 % and 3 %, respectively,
    partly offset the above. For the six months, Food   Beverage sales  increased
    4% driven by growth in the Western Hemisphere (+62%) and Asia (+6 %).
    Sales in Europe were down 5 %. The sales growth in the Western Hemisphere
    reflects the effect of increasing consumables business as well as

increased  systems business. In Asia, sales were down in the quarter partly due
    to the timing of systems sales. Sales growth in Asia in the six months was
    driven by system solutions for the brewery market as well as increased consumables
    business.  In Europe, sales were  negatively impacted by lower OEM sales
    and a weakness in the wine markets, which the Company does not expect to
    improve this fiscal year. The Company continues to leverage the expertise
    of its European Food   Beverage team  into growing regions in Latin America,
    the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Asia, and this strategy has begun to
    accelerate growth in these emerging regions. Municipal Water sales were down
    16% in the quarter and 9 % in the six  months reflecting the lumpy nature
    of this business, which is primarily comprised of system sales. All geographies
    reported shortfalls in the quarter. In the six months, modest growth in Europe
    was offset by shortfalls in the Western Hemisphere and Asia. Overall, orders
    growth remains strong, with orders increasing 24% in the quarter and 37 %
    in the six months. The increase in orders was fueled by the Western Hemisphere.
    The Company is working on initiatives to spur growth in Europe and is expecting
    sales in this region to improve by the end of fiscal year 2006. Additionally,
    the Company s product  offering in the Landfill Leachate sector will
    provide an additional growth engine for Europe and Asia. Overall, the Company
    expects sales in the General Industrial segment, to increase in the high
    single-digit range for the full fiscal year 2006.

Aerospace
    sales increased 12% in both the quarter and six months. Growth was fueled
    by core repeat business, such as aftermarket support and OEM production levels;
    and project business, such as aircraft retrofits and upgrades. In the Western
    Hemisphere, Aerospace sales increased 6% in the quarter (+8% for the six
    months), while in Europe sales grew 17% (+18% for the six months).  In
    Asia, the smallest of the Company s Aerospace  markets, sales were up
    71% and 30% in the quarter and six months, respectively. Within Aerospace,
    Commercial sales increased 3% in the quarter and 6 % in the  six months.
    By geography, strong growth in the Western Hemisphere (+28% in the quarter
    and 21% in the six months) driven by incremental sales attributable to the
    transaction with Satair was partly offset by shortfalls in Europe (-22 %
    in the quarter and  10 % in the six months).   Military sales
    increased 22% and 19 % in the quarter and six months,  respectively.
    The growth in Military sales was driven by strong growth in Europe (+68%
    in the quarter and +64 % in the six months) partly offset by  shortfalls
    in the Western Hemisphere  (-17% and -6 % in the quarter
    and six months, respectively). Overall, the Company expects sales in the
    Aerospace segment, to increase in the high single-digit range for the full
    fiscal year 2006. 

Microelectronics
    sales were up 17% in the quarter and 11% in the six months. In the quarter,
    all geographies had double-digit growth. For the six months, the increase
    in Microelectronics sales was driven by strong growth in Asia (+15 %)
    supported by growth in the Western Hemisphere (+3%) and Europe (+4%). A boom
    in new  fab   construction has favorably impacted sales growth
    in the quarter and six months. Additionally, the display and storage side
    of the business is very robust. The strong sales of MP-3 players, flat panel
    televisions, and other consumer electronics are bell weathers for the Microelectronics
    industry. The Company s  growth in the thin film rigid disc (storage)
    market is directly attributable to consumer adoption of memory intensive
    devices. The Semiconductor Industry Association is forecasting continued
    growth in equipment sales through at least 2007, and consequently, the Company
    believes that its OEM segment of the business will benefit. The Company expects
    continued strong sales in the Microelectronics segment in the second half
    of fiscal year 2006. 

The
    consolidated operating profit as a percentage of sales was 14.2% as compared
    to 15% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005. Operating profit dollars
    decreased by $2,611, or 3 %, to $67,901. The reduction in operating
    profit reflects the integration of the research and development function
    into the lines of business, previously managed as a Corporate function, pricing
    reductions in the blood filtration business, transition costs related to
    the Company s facility rationalization initiative, ongoing investments
    in Asia and the impact of stock compensation and the adoption
    of SFAS No.
    123(R).
    The integration of the research and development function primarily impacted
    the Life Sciences business (principally Medical and in the Western Hemisphere).
    The effect of these factors was partly offset by savings generated by the
    Company s cost reduction programs and the impact of  higher sales growth,
    particularly in Microelectronics and Aerospace. For the six months, the consolidated
    operating
    profit as a percentage of sales was 13.4% as compared to 14.5% for the six
    months of fiscal year 2005. Operating profit dollars decreased by $6,549,
    or 5%, to $121,494. The reduction in operating profit reflects the factors
    discussed above. In addition, operating profit was negatively impacted by
    several low margin Industrial system sales in Europe in the first quarter
    as well as the impact of facility and equipment refurbishments in the European Life Sciences   plants.  The
    operating profit details for the quarter and six months ended January 31,
    2006 and January 31, 2005 can be found in the Segment Information and Geographies
    note accompanying the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Geographies:  

The  table below presents sales for the quarter and six months ended January  31, 2006 and January 31, 2005 to  unaffiliated customers by geography, including the effect of exchange rates for  comparative purposes.  

Sales
    in the Western Hemisphere for the quarter increased 6 % on a reported
    basis and 6% on a local currency basis compared with the second quarter of
    fiscal year 2005. For the six months, sales increased 4% on both a reported
    and local currency basis. The increase in sales in the quarter and six months
    reflects growth in all of the segments with the exception of Medical. Exchange
    rates increased sales by $331 and $842 in the quarter and six months, respectively,
    primarily related to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar. Operating
    profit was 11.2% of total sales (including intercompany sales to other geographies)
    compared to 16% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 as reduced pricing
    in the blood filtration business, the impact of stock compensation and the
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) and the transfer of the research and development
    function from Corporate was partly offset by savings generated from the Company s
    cost reduction programs. Operating profit dollars decreased $8,246, or 23 %.
    For the six months, operating profit declined to 12.2% and operating profit
    dollars
    decreased $6,888, or 11%, reflecting the factors discussed above. 

In
    Europe, local currency sales in the quarter increased 8% reflecting growth
    in all segments, with particularly strong growth seen in Aerospace and Microelectronics.
    The weakening of European currencies reduced sales by $18,854 resulting in
    a reported sales decline of 2%. For the six months, local currency sales
    increased 5 % reflecting growth in all segments, with particularly strong
    growth seen in Aerospace. The weakening of European currencies reduced sales
    by $21,727 resulting in a slight decline in sales on a reported basis. Operating
    profit was 8.6% of total sales (including intercompany sales to other geographies)
    as compared to 9.2% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, while operating
    profit dollars declined $1,434, or 7% to $19,063. The decline in operating
    profit was partly attributable to the impact of stock compensation and the
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) as well as transition costs related to the Company s
    facility rationalization initiative. For the six months, operating profit
    was 7.6% as compared to 9.9%, while operating profit dollars declined $9,519,
    or 23%. The decline in operating profit reflects the factors discussed above
    as well as the impact of several low margin Industrial system sales and facility
    and equipment refurbishments in certain Life Sciences  plants.  

Sales
    in Asia increased 8% in local currency in the quarter driven by growth in
    all segments with the exception of General Industrial. The weakening of the
    Yen partly offset by the strengthening of certain Asian currencies, reduced
    sales by $6,692, resulting in reported sales growth of 2%. For the six months,
    sales increased 10% in local currency reflecting growth in all segments.
    The weakening of the Yen partly offset by the strengthening of certain Asian
    currencies, reduced sales by $6,175, resulting in reported sales growth of
    7%. Operating profit improved to 16% of total sales (including intercompany
    sales to other geographies) from 14.7% in the second quarter of fiscal year
    2005. Operating profit dollars increased by $1,824, or 11% to $18,277, reflecting
    the growth in sales partly offset by increased costs related to the Company s
    ongoing investments in sales and manufacturing in this

region and the impact of stock compensation and the  adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).
    For the six months, operating profit improved to 15.1% from 14.5%. Operating
    profit dollars increased by $3,603, or 12%, reflecting the factors discussed
    above.

General
    corporate expenses decreased $1,830, or 10 % to $15,422. For the six
    months, general corporate expenses decreased $4,504, or 13% to $29,800. The
    decline in expenses in the quarter and six months reflects the impact of
    the Company s
    cost reduction programs, the transfer of the research and development function
    into the lines of business partly offset by the impact of stock compensation
    and
    the
adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) as well as increased amortization expense.  

Liquidity  and Capital Resources  

Net  cash provided by operating activities for the first six months of fiscal year  2006 was $125,020, an increase of $59,246 as compared with the first six months  of fiscal year 2005. The increase in cash flow reflects the improvement in DSO  (see discussion below), the impact of the transaction with Satair as well as  changes in working capital items, particularly reduced payments for income  taxes. 

Free  cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less  capital expenditures, was $72,999 for the first six months of fiscal year 2006,  as compared with $25,791 for the first six months of fiscal year 2005.  The increase in free cash flow reflects the  factors discussed above, partly offset by a higher level of capital expenditures.  The Company believes this measure is important because it is a key element of  its planning. The Company utilizes free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure,  as one way to measure its current and future financial performance. The  following table reconciles free cash flow to net cash provided by operating  activities. 

The  Company s balance sheet is affected by spot exchange rates used to translate  local currency amounts into U.S. dollars. In comparing spot exchange rates at  January 31, 2006 to those at July 31, 2005, the British Pound and the Euro have  strengthened against the U.S. dollar, while the Japanese Yen has weakened  against the U.S. dollar. 

Working  capital was approximately $777,000, a ratio of 2.8 at January 31, 2006 as  compared with $703,300, a ratio of 2.5 at July 31, 2005. Accounts receivable  days sales outstanding improved to 80 days in the quarter, as compared to 85  days in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005. Inventory turns, for the four  quarters ended January 31, 2006, were 2.6 as compared to 2.9 for the four  quarters ended July 31, 2005. The effect of foreign exchange increased net  inventory, net accounts receivable and other current assets by $765, $1,476 and  $192, respectively, as compared with year-end fiscal year 2005. Additionally,  foreign exchange increased accounts payable and other current liabilities by  $964 and income taxes payable by $31. Overall, net debt (debt net of cash and  cash equivalents), as a percentage of total capitalization (net debt plus  equity), was 21.1% as compared to 24.5% at July 31, 2005.

Net debt decreased by  approximately $52,300 compared with year-end fiscal year 2005, primarily due to  the significant increase in cash. Total gross debt increased approximately  $10,800 as compared with year-end fiscal year 2005. The impact of foreign  exchange rates increased gross debt by about $200.  As
such, the actual increase in the Company s gross debt was  approximately $10,600 in the six months of fiscal year 2006. The Company was in  compliance with all covenants of its various debt agreements as of January 31,  2006. 

Proceeds  from stock plans were $14,553 in the first six months of fiscal year 2006.  Capital expenditures were $52,021 for the first six months of fiscal year 2006  ($30,385 expended in the current quarter). Depreciation was $42,775 in the  first six months of fiscal year 2006 ($20,957 in the current quarter), while  amortization expense was $4,523 ($2,670 in the current quarter). Full year  fiscal year 2006 capital expenditures are expected to be slightly above the fiscal  year 2005 level, while depreciation and amortization expense are expected to  total approximately $93,000.  

On
    October 17, 2003, the Board of Directors authorized the expenditure of up
    to $200,000 to repurchase shares of the Company s common stock. Furthermore,
    on October 14, 2004, the Board of Directors authorized an additional expenditure
    of another $200,000 to repurchase shares. During fiscal years 2004 and 2005,
    the Company repurchased stock of $75,000 and $64,246, respectively. In the
    first six months of fiscal year 2006, the Company repurchased stock of $5,750.
    This leaves $255,004 remaining at January 31, 2006 of the $400,000 the Board
    of Directors authorized for share repurchases. In the first six months of
    fiscal year 2006, the Company paid dividends of   $24,885.  The Company
    increased its dividend by 10%, from 10 to 11 cents per share, effective with
    the dividend that was declared on January 19, 2006. The Company expects to
    pay dividends of about $53,000 for the full fiscal year 2006.

In
    August 2005, the Company sold its investment in VITEX and recorded a gain
    on the sale of $1,806, net of fees and commissions. In addition, in January
    2006, the Company sold its stock rights in Satair and recorded a gain of
    $394. For more detail regarding these transactions, refer to the Restructuring
and Other Charges note accompanying the condensed consolidated financial statements.  

The  Company considers its existing lines of credit, along with the cash generated  from operations, to be sufficient for both short-term and long-term growth.  

Adoption of  New Accounting Pronouncement  

Effective  August 1, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of  SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment ( SFAS No. 123(R) ), using the  modified-prospective-transition method.   Under that transition method, compensation cost recognized for the three  and six months ended January 31, 2006 includes: (a) compensation cost for all  share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, August 1,  2005, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the  original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (b) compensation cost for the vested  portion of share-based payments granted subsequent to August 1, 2005, based on  the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS  No. 123(R).  Results for prior periods  have not been restated. 

The
    following table illustrates the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) on August
    1, 2005 on the Company s
earnings before income taxes, net earnings and earnings per share (which excludes
    the effect of certain changes to the Company s stock plans under the 2005
    plan such as the restricted stock units granted in contemplation of the change
    in accounting): 

SFAS
    No. 123(R) also requires that excess tax benefits related to stock option
    exercises be reflected as financing cash inflows.  For
    the six months ended January 31, 2006, this treatment resulted in cash flows
    from financing activities of $308, which reduced cash
flows from operating activities by the same amount.  The tax benefit recognized
related to the total compensation cost for share-based payment arrangements totaled
$533 and $1,020 for the three and six months ended January 31, 2006, respectively,
and totaled $43 and $86 for the three and six months ended January 31, 2005,
respectively. The
actual
tax
benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercise of the share-based
payment
arrangements totaled $3,293 and $4,905 for the three and six months ended January
31, 2006, respectively. 

Recently  Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

On
    October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the  Act )
    was signed into law. The Act provides for a special one-time tax deduction
    of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the
    Act.  In December 2004, the Financial Accounting  Standards Board ( FASB )
    issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance
    for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs
    Creation Act of 2004 ( FSP FAS 109-2 ).  FSP FAS 109-2 allows
    companies additional time to evaluate the effect of the Act as to whether
    unrepatriated foreign earnings continue to qualify for the SFAS No. 109,
    Accounting for Income Taxes ( SFAS No. 109 ) exception regarding
    non-recognition of deferred tax liabilities and requires explanatory disclosures
    from those who need the additional time.  As of January 31,  2006, the
    Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries since substantially all such earnings were expected
    to be permanently invested in foreign operations.   The extent to which
    the Company will ultimately take advantage of this provision depends on a
    number of factors, including reviewing future Congressional or Treasury Department
    guidance, before a determination can be made.  The range of reasonably
    possible amounts, based upon the law, that are being considered for repatriation
    due to the aforementioned provision is between zero and $500,000.  The
    related potential range of income tax is between zero and $26,250. 

In
    December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109-1, Application
    of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction
    on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation
    Act of 2004 ( FSP FAS 
109-1 ).  FSP FAS 109-1 clarifies
    that the qualified production activities  deduction should be treated as a special deduction as  

27

described in SFAS No.  109.  The impact of the deduction will  be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed. The Company is in the  process of assessing the effect of FSP FAS 109-1 on its consolidated financial  statements. 

In  March 2005, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for  Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations ( FIN No. 47 ). FIN No. 47 describes a  conditional asset retirement obligation as a legal obligation to perform an  asset retirement activity whose timing or method of settlement is conditional  on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The  obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even  though uncertainty exists about the timing or method of settlement. Thus, the  timing or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event.  Accordingly, an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value  of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability  can be reasonably estimated. FIN No. 47 also clarifies when an entity would  have sufficient information to reasonably estimate

the fair value of an asset  retirement obligation. FIN No. 47 is effective for fiscal years ending after  December 15, 2005. The Company is in the process of assessing the effect of FIN  No. 47 on its consolidated financial statements. 

In  June 2005,
  the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error  Corrections
   ( SFAS No. 154 ), which will require entities that voluntarily make
  a change in accounting principle to apply that change retrospectively to prior
  periods  financial statements, unless this would be impracticable. SFAS
  No. 154  supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting
  Changes ( APB  No. 20 ), which previously required that most
  voluntary changes in accounting  principle be recognized by including in the
  current period s net earnings the  cumulative effect of changing to the
  new accounting principle. SFAS No. 154  also makes a distinction between
  retrospective application  of an accounting  principle and
  the  restatement  of financial statements to reflect the  correction
  of an error.  Another  significant change in practice under SFAS No. 154
   will be that if an entity  changes its method of depreciation, amortization,
  or depletion for long-lived, non-financial assets, the change must be accounted
  for as a change in accounting estimate. Under APB No. 20, such a change would
  have been reported as a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 applies
  to accounting changes and error corrections that are made in fiscal years
  beginning after December  15, 2005.  

In February 2006 the FASB issued SFAS
      No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments ( SFAS No. 155 ),
      which amends SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
      Activities, and SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
      Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. SFAS No. 155 allows
      financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for
      as a whole (eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host)
      if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value
      basis. SFAS No. 155 also clarifies and amends certain other provisions
      of SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140. This statement is effective for all financial
      instruments acquired or issued in fiscal years beginning after September
      15, 2006. The Company is in the process of assessing the effect of SFAS
      No. 155 on its consolidated financial statements.  

ITEM  3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.   

During  the period from the Company s fiscal 2005 year end (July 31, 2005) to the end  of the Company s second fiscal quarter (January 31, 2006), there was no  material change in the market risk information previously reported in Item 7A  of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended July 31,  2005. 

ITEM  4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.   

As  of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an  evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s  management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial  Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and  procedures as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and  Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and  procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by  the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange  Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time  periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. 

There  were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting  during the Company s fiscal second quarter ended January 31, 2006, that have  materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the  Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

It  should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and  operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the  objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system  is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future  events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems,  there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated  goals under all potential future conditions.

PART II. OTHER  INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.   

(In  thousands)  

In
    February 1988, an action was filed in the Circuit Court for Washtenaw County,
    Michigan ( Court ) by the State of Michigan ( State )
    against Gelman Sciences Inc. ( Gelman ), a subsidiary acquired
    by Pall Corporation (the  Company  or   Pall ) in February
    1997. The action sought to compel Gelman to investigate and remediate contamination
    near Gelman s Ann Arbor facility and requested  reimbursement of costs
    the State had expended in investigating the contamination, which the State
    alleged was caused by Gelman s disposal of waste  water from its manufacturing
    process. Pursuant to a consent judgment entered into by Gelman and the State
    in October 1992 (amended September 1996 and October 1999), which resolved
    that litigation, Gelman is remediating the contamination without admitting
    wrongdoing. In February 2000, the State Assistant Attorney

General filed a Motion to Enforce Consent Judgment in the Court seeking  approximately
    $4,900 in stipulated penalties for the alleged violations of the consent
    judgment and additional injunctive relief. Gelman disputed these assertions.
    Following an evidentiary hearing in July 2000, the Court took the matter
    of penalties  under advisement.  The Court issued a Remediation
    Enforcement Order ( the REO ) requiring Gelman to submit and implement
    a detailed plan that will reduce the contamination to acceptable levels within
    five years. Gelman s plan has been approved by both the Court and the
    State.  Although Gelman has met monthly  milestones established under
    the plan and although contaminant concentrations have been significantly
    reduced, groundwater concentrations remain above acceptable levels in much
    of the affected area.  The Court, however, concluded that Gelman was
    in compliance with the terms the REO in a subsequent order issued in December
    2004 (see below) and has expressed its satisfaction with Gelman s progress
    during hearings both before and after the five year period expired.   Neither
    the State nor the Court has sought or suggested that Gelman should be penalized
    based on the continued presence of groundwater contamination at the site.   

In  February 2004, the Court instructed Gelman to submit its Final Feasibility  Study describing how it intends to address an area of groundwater contamination  not addressed by the previously approved plan.   Gelman has submitted its Feasibility Study as instructed.  The State also submitted its plan for  remediating this area of contamination to the Court.  On December 17, 2004, the Court issued its Order and Opinion  Regarding Remediation and Contamination of the Unit E Aquifer (the  Unit E  Order ).  The Court adopted, with  limited modifications, Gelman s remediation plan for this area of  contamination.  The Court also noted  that Gelman was in compliance with the Court s previous REO.  The State has not appealed the Unit E  Order.  Gelman is now in the process of  implementing the requirements of the Order. 

In  correspondence dated June 5, 2001, the State asserted that additional  stipulated penalties in the amount of $142 were owed for a separate alleged  violation of the consent judgment. The Court found that a  substantial basis   for Gelman s position existed and again took the State s request  under  advisement , pending the results of certain groundwater monitoring data. Those  data have been submitted to the Court, but no ruling has been issued.  On August 9, 2001, the State made a written  demand for reimbursement of $227 it has allegedly incurred for groundwater  monitoring. Gelman considers this claim barred by the consent judgment. 

On  May 12, 2004, the City of Ann Arbor (the  City ) filed a lawsuit against Gelman  in Washtenaw County Circuit Court.  The  City s suit seeks damages, including the cost of replacing a municipal water  supply well allegedly affected by the 1,4-dioxane groundwater contamination, as  well as injunctive relief in the form of an order requiring Gelman to remediate  the soil and groundwater beneath the City.   The contaminant levels allegedly detected in the municipal well at  issue, however, are well below applicable cleanup standards and Gelman will  vigorously defend against the claim.   

By Order dated July 19, 2005, the Court  granted Gelman s motion for partial summary disposition, in part, dismissing  two of the City s three common law claims.   In December 2005, Gelman filed two motions for partial summary  disposition seeking dismissal of the City s claims for injunctive relief and  the majority of its monetary claims.   The City filed a motion for summary disposition with regard to Gelman s  liability under state statute.  Rather  than hear the motions, the Court ordered the parties into settlement  facilitation that is to be concluded by June 1, 2006.  To accommodate the facilitation, the trial in this matter has  been rescheduled to August 21, 2006.

    June 25, 2004, the Company was sued in the United States District Court for
    the Eastern District of Michigan by a private plaintiff in connection with
    the groundwater contamination.  The  complaint seeks both money damages
    and injunctive relief requiring remediation of the contamination.  The
    plaintiff also seeks to represent a larger class of property owners and residents
    who plaintiff claims are affected by the groundwater contamination. On August 25, 2004, the Company filed
    a motion for summary judgment seeking to dismiss the plaintiff s claims.  In
    response, plaintiff s counsel sought and  was granted permission to
    amend the complaint.   An amended complaint was filed on November 17,
    2004, which added seven plaintiffs.  The Company renewed its  motion
    for summary judgment on December 27, 2004, asserting various grounds for
    dismissing the complaint as to each plaintiff.   As ordered by the Court,
    the Company withdrew its motion to allow plaintiffs an opportunity to further
    amend its complaint and conduct limited discovery.  Plaintiffs filed
    a second amended complaint on March 9, 2005, adding two claims under the
    federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ).  Discovery
    on specific issues related to the seven plaintiffs has been completed, and
    on October 17, 2005, the Company renewed for a third time its motion for
    summary judgment

, asserting that none of the plaintiffs have  established claims under any of
    the counts alleged, including RCRA. By order dated January 30, 2006, the
    Court granted the Company s motion and dismissed  the entire case.  To
    date, the plaintiffs have not sought to appeal this order.

On  August 10, 2005, the City filed a lawsuit against Gelman under the Federal  Superfund Statute ( CERCLA ) for recovery of the City s alleged response costs,  including well replacement costs.  The  City is seeking in this matter essentially the same relief it is seeking in the  above-described state court action.   Gelman filed its responsive pleadings on September 15, 2005 and will  vigorously defend the lawsuit. In October, 2005, Gelman filed a Motion for  Stay, seeking to stay these federal proceedings pending resolution of the  parallel state court action.  The  parties have agreed to include this matter in the settlement facilitation  ordered by the state court and to stay this matter until June 1, 2006 if the  Court denies Gelman s stay motion. 

A  local resident and the City of Ann Arbor filed petitions for a contested case  on November 26, 2005 and November 30, 2005, respectively.  The petitions challenge various aspects of  the discharge permit issued to Gelman by the State on September 30, 2005.  The petitions commence an administrative  adjudicative hearing, which can result in changes to the discharge permit.  The Company does not believe there is  substantive merit to the claims made in either petition.  The Administrative Law Judge has  consolidated both petitions into one proceeding.  The Administrative Law Judge has also stayed this proceeding  until June 1, 2006 to allow the City and Gelman to attempt to resolve this  matter through the facilitative process described above.  No damages are being sought in this  proceeding. 

The  Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet at January 31, 2006 contains a  reserve for environmental liabilities of approximately $21,778, which relates  primarily to the aforementioned items. In the opinion of management, the  Company is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and its  accruals for environmental remediation are adequate at this time. 

Reference  is also made to the Contingencies and Commitments note in the notes  accompanying the condensed consolidated financial statements in this report.

(c)        There  shall be added back to the aggregate number of Shares available for the grant  of Awards under the Plan, as determined under (a) and (b) above, the  following:  (i) any Shares as to which  an Option granted hereunder has not been exercised at the time of its  expiration, cancellation or forfeiture; (ii) any Shares that otherwise would  have been issued upon the exercise of an Option granted hereunder that are  surrendered in payment of the exercise price of such Option; (iii) any Shares  included in any other form of Award granted hereunder, to the extent that the  Participant s right to receive such Shares, or any cash payment in settlement  of such Award, becomes forfeited; (iv) any Shares that otherwise would have  been issued upon the exercise of an Option or in payment with respect to any  other form of Award granted hereunder,
that are surrendered in payment or  partial payment of taxes required to be withheld with respect to the exercise  of such option or the making of such   payment; (v) any Shares represented by Restricted Units or Performance  Units granted hereunder as to which payment   is made in cash instead of by the issuance and delivery of Shares; and  (vi) any Shares subject to an Option granted hereunder, or covered by any other  form of Award made hereunder, to the extent such Option or other Award is  surrendered in exchange for any other Award made hereunder, subject to the  limitations set forth in the last sentence of Section 3(c) hereof. 

(d)        The  limitations provided in this Section 4 shall be subject to adjustment as  provided in Section 13. 

5.       Awards  of Options.  

Subject  to the limitations set forth in Section 4 and to the other terms and conditions  of the Plan, Options may be granted under the Plan to such Eligible Employees  for the purchase of  

6 

such number of Shares, at such  times, and upon such terms and conditions, as the Committee in its discretion  may determine. Options shall be granted in accordance with the provisions set  forth below. 

(a)         Type  of Options .  Each Option granted  hereunder shall be identified in the instrument evidencing such grant as either  (i) an Option intended to be treated as an Incentive Stock Option, or (ii) an  Option that shall be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock Option. 

(b)         Maximum  Number of Shares Subject to Options.    The total number of Shares with respect to which Options may be granted  to any Eligible Employee during any period of 24 consecutive months shall not  exceed 300,000 Shares, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 13. 

(c)         Term  of Options .  The term during which  an Option may be exercised shall be such period of time as determined by the  Committee and specified in the instrument evidencing the grant of the Option,  but in no event may the term of any Option exceed ten years from the Date of  Grant of the Option.  Notwithstanding  any other provision in the Plan to the contrary, no Option may be exercised  after its expiration. 

(d)         Exercise  of Options .  Each Option granted  hereunder shall become exercisable, in whole or in part, at such time or times  during its term as the instrument evidencing the grant of such Option shall  specify.  To the extent that an  Option  has become exercisable pursuant  to the preceding sentence, it may be exercised thereafter at any time or  from time to time during its term, as to any or all Shares as to which the  Option has become and remains exercisable, subject to the provisions of (e)  below. 

(e)         Termination  of Employment .  Except as the  instrument evidencing the grant of an Option may otherwise provide, the portion  of any outstanding Option held by an Eligible Employee on the date of his or  her Termination of Employment that has not become exercisable prior to such  date, and the portion of such Option which was exercisable but had not been  exercised prior to such date, shall be forfeited on such date.  

The  instrument evidencing the grant of an Option may provide for the portion of the  Option that is exercisable at the time of the Eligible Employee s Termination  of Employment to remain exercisable, and for the portion of such Option that is  not yet exercisable at such time to become exercisable in accordance with the  terms of the Option and remain exercisable thereafter, during such period of  time after the date on which the Eligible Employee s Termination of Employment  occurs (but not beyond the expiration of the term of the Option), in such  circumstances and subject to such terms and conditions, as are specified in  such instrument.  However, to the extent  that any Option granted hereunder to an Eligible Employee as an Incentive Stock  Option is exercised more than three months after the date of such employee s  Termination of Employment for any reason other than
Disability, or more than  one year after such date if the employee s Termination of Employment occurred  because of Disability, the Option shall be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock Option  for purposes of the Plan. 

(f)         Exercise  Price and Method of Exercise .  The  price at which Shares may be purchased upon any exercise of an Option shall be  the price per share determined by the  

7 

Committee and specified in the  instrument evidencing the grant of such Option, but in no event shall the  exercise price per share be less than (i) the Fair Market Value of a Share  determined as of the Date of Grant of the Option, or (ii), if greater, the par  value of a Share. 

An  Option shall be exercised by delivery of a written notice of exercise, in a  form satisfactory to the Committee, to the Corporation at its principal  business office and addressed to the attention of the Corporation s
    Secretary or such other person as the Corporate Secretary may have designated
to receive such not ice.  The notice shall specify  the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised.  The notice shall be accompanied by payment  of the exercise price of the Shares for which the Option is being exercised,  which payment shall be made under one or more of the methods of payment  provided in (g) below.  An Option may  not be exercised at any one time as to less than 100 Shares, or less than the  number of Shares to which the Option is then exercisable if that number is less  than 100 Shares. 

(g)         Payment .  Payment of the exercise price for Shares  purchased upon the exercise of an Option shall be made by one, or by a  combination of any, of the following methods:   (i) in cash, which may be paid by check or other instrument  acceptable to the Corporation, or by wire transfer of funds, in each case in  United States dollars; (ii) if   permitted by the Committee and subject to any terms and conditions it  may impose on the use of such methods, by (A) the delivery to the  Corporation of other Shares owned by the Participant, or (B) the surrender  to the Corporation of Shares that otherwise would have been  delivered to the Participant upon exercise  of the Option; (iii) to the extent permissible under applicable law,  through any cashless exercise sale and remittance procedure that the
Committee  in its discretion may from time to time approve; (iv) to the extent  permissible under applicable law and permitted by the Committee, by the execution  by the Participant and delivery to the Corporation of a promissory note or  other instrument evidencing the Participant s agreement to pay part or all of  the option exercise price on a deferred or installment payment basis, upon such  terms and conditions (including without limitation terms requiring Shares  purchased upon the exercise of the Option to be pledged to the Corporation to secure payment of any  outstanding balance of the option exercise price ) as the Committee shall  require; or (v) any other method of payment as the Committee may from time  to time approve.  

For  purposes of determining the portion of the exercise price payable upon the  exercise of an Option that will be treated as satisfied by the delivery or  surrender of Shares pursuant to clause (ii) (A) or (B) above, Shares so  delivered or surrendered shall be valued at their Fair Market Value determined  as of the Trading Day next preceding the date on which the Option is exercised  . 

(h)         Incentive  Stock Options .   Notwithstanding any other provisions of the  Plan, Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan shall be subject to the  following provisions: 

(i)        No    Incentive Stock Option may be granted under the Plan after November 16,    2014, unless the shareholders of the Corporation have approved an extension    of the period for granting Incentive Stock Options under the Plan beyond that    date. 

8 

(ii)       To    the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of Shares with respect to which    Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan and under all other stock    option plans maintained by the Corporation are exercisable for the first time    by a Participant during any calendar year shall exceed $100,000, the    Incentive Stock Options so exercisable shall be treated as Non-Qualified    Stock Options.  For purposes of the    foregoing, the Fair Market Value of Shares as to which any Incentive Stock    Option may be exercised shall be determined as of the date on which such    Option is granted. The determination of whether the limitation set forth in    the second preceding sentence shall apply with respect to any Incentive Stock    Option granted under the Plan shall be made in accordance with applicable    provisions of section
422 of the Code and     the regulations issued thereunder. 

(iii)      No    Incentive Stock Option shall be granted to an Eligible Employee if, as of the    Date of Grant of such Option, such Eligible Employee owns stock possessing    more than ten percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of    stock of the Corporation, unless (A) the exercise price per Share under such    Option is at least 110% percent of the Fair Market Value of a Share    determined as of the Date of Grant of such Option, and (B) such Option    is not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the Date of Grant    of such Option. 

(iv)      The    instrument evidencing the grant of any Incentive Stock Option shall require    that if any Shares acquired upon the exercise of such option are disposed of    within 2 years from the Date of Grant of such option, or within one year from    the date as of which the Shares disposed of were transferred to the    Participant pursuant to the exercise of such option,  the Participant shall give the Corporation    written notice of such disposition, within ten days following the date of    such disposition.   

(i)         Other  Option Provisions .  The instrument  evidencing the grant of any Option hereunder may contain such other terms and  conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan or any applicable  law, as the Committee may determine. 

(j)         Rights  of a Shareholder .  Upon the exercise  of an Option or any portion thereof in accordance with the Plan, the provisions  of the instrument evidencing the grant of such Option and any applicable rules  and regulations established by the Committee, the holder of the Option shall  have all of the rights of a shareholder of the Corporation with respect to the  Shares issued as a result of such exercise. 

6.        Awards  of Restricted Shares and Restricted Units  

Subject  to the limitations set forth in Section 4 and to the other terms and conditions  of the Plan, Restricted Shares or Restricted Units may be granted to such  Eligible Employees, at such times, and in such amounts, as the Committee may  determine in its discretion. Restricted Shares   and Restricted Units shall be granted in accordance with the provisions  set forth below. 

(a)         Restrictions  and Restricted Period .  At the time  of each grant of Restricted Shares or Restricted Units to any Participant, the  Committee shall establish a period of time within which the Restricted Shares  or Restricted Units covered by such grant (and the Participant s right

to receive payment with respect  to such restricted Units) may not be sold, assigned, transferred (other than a  transfer to the Participant s Beneficiary occurring by reason of the  Participant s death), made subject to gift, or otherwise disposed of,  mortgaged, pledged or otherwise encumbered, whether voluntarily or by operation  of law.  The Committee in its discretion  may prescribe a separate Restricted Period for any specified portion of the  Restricted Shares or Restricted Units granted pursuant to any Award. 

(b)         Rights  While Restricted Shares Remain Subject to Restrictions .  Restricted Shares granted to a Participant  hereunder shall be issued to the Participant as of the Date of Grant as  uncertificated shares.  Until the  Restrictions to which such shares are subject lapse in accordance with the  provisions of (d) below or Section 12(c), the Restricted Shares granted to a  Participant shall be held in the Participant s name in a bookkeeping account  maintained by the Corporation. A separate account shall be maintained for all  Restricted Shares granted to a Participant with a Restricted Period ending on  the same date. 

Except  for the Restrictions to which such shares are subject, and subject to the  forfeiture provisions applicable under (e) below, a Participant shall have,  with respect to all Restricted Shares so held for his account, all of the  rights of a shareholder of the Corporation, including full voting rights with  respect to such shares and the right to receive currently with respect to the  Participant s Restricted Shares all dividends and other distributions payable  generally on the Corporation s Shares. If any dividends or distributions so  payable are paid in Shares, the Shares paid as a dividend or distribution with  respect to a Participant s Restricted Shares shall be subject to the same  Restrictions and provisions relating to forfeiture as apply to the Restricted  Shares with respect to which they were paid.   Such stock dividend Shares shall themselves be treated as
Restricted  Shares, and shall be credited to the same account which the Corporation  maintains for those Restricted Shares of the Participant with respect to which  such stock dividends or distributions were paid.  

Notwithstanding  the foregoing, if the instrument evidencing the grant of any Restricted Shares  to a Participant so provides, all cash dividends and distributions payable  generally on the Corporation s Shares that are otherwise payable with respect  to the Restricted Shares granted to the Participant shall not be paid currently  to the Participant but instead, shall be applied to the purchase of additional  Shares for the Participant s account. The additional Shares so purchased shall  be subject to the same Restrictions and provisions relating to forfeiture as  apply to the Restricted Shares with respect to which they were paid.  Such additional Shares shall themselves be  treated as Restricted Shares, and shall be credited to the same account which  the Corporation maintains for those Restricted Shares of the Participant with  respect to which such dividends or distributions were
paid.  The purchase of any such additional Shares  shall be made either (i) through the Corporation s Dividend Reinvestment Plan,  or (ii) in accordance with such other procedure as may be specified in the  instrument evidencing the grant of the Restricted Shares on which such  dividends are paid. 

(c)         Rights  While Restricted Units Remain Subject to Restrictions .  No Shares shall be issued at the time any  award of Restricted Units is made hereunder. Restricted Units granted to a  Participant hereunder shall be credited to a bookkeeping account maintained by  the Corporation for the Participant.  A  separate account shall be maintained for all Restricted Units granted to a  

10 

Participant with a Restricted  Period ending on the same date, and for all Dividend Equivalent Units that are  to be credited to such account  in  accordance with the next following paragraph. 

Until  the Restrictions applicable to the Restricted Units credited upon grant to any  account maintained for a Participant  in  accordance with the preceding paragraph shall lapse, additional Restricted  Units shall be credited to such account with respect to the Restricted Units so  credited, as of each Dividend Payment Date.   The number of additional Restricted Units to be credited shall be  determined by  first  multiplying (A) the total number of Restricted Units  standing to the Participant s credit in such account on the day immediately  preceding such Dividend Payment Date (including all Dividend Equivalent Units  credited to such account on all previous Dividend Payment Dates), by (B) the  per-share dollar amount of the dividend paid on such Dividend Payment Date  and  then , dividing the resulting amount by the Closing Price of one share of  Common Stock on such
Dividend Payment Date. 

(d)         Lapse  of Restrictions and Payment .  Upon  the expiration of the Restricted Period for any Restricted Shares or Restricted  Units granted to a Participant hereunder but subject to the provisions of (e)  below, the Restrictions applicable to such Restricted Shares or Restricted  Units shall lapse, and payment with respect to such Restricted Shares or  Restricted Units (including any related Dividend Equivalent Units) shall be  made in accordance with the following provisions: 

(i)        In    the case of Restricted Shares, payment shall be made by delivery to the    Participant of a stock certificate for the number of such  Restricted Shares, free and clear of all    Restrictions to which such shares were subject. However, if the Restricted    Shares with respect to which the applicable Restrictions have lapsed includes    a fractional Share, payment for such fractional Share shall be made in cash,    in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of such fractional Share    determined as of  the date on which    such Restrictions lapsed. Delivery of such stock certificate and any such    cash payment shall be made to the Participant as soon after the lapse of the    applicable Restriction as is practicable.  

(ii)      In the case of Restricted Units    (including related Dividend Equivalent Units), payment shall be made (A)    by  the issuance and delivery to the    Participant of a stock certificate for a number of Shares equal to the number    of whole Restricted Units and related Dividend Equivalent Units with respect    to which the applicable Restrictions have lapsed, and (B) by payment in    cash for any fractional Restricted Unit payable as a result of the lapse of    such Restrictions, in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of such    fractional Restricted Unit determined as of the date as of which such    Restrictions lapsed.  Notwithstanding    the foregoing, payment for Restricted Units (including related Dividend    Equivalent Units) with respect to which the applicable Restrictions have    lapsed shall be made solely in
cash, in an amount equal to the Fair Market    Value of all of such Units and any fractional Unit, determined as of the date    on which such Restrictions lapsed, if the instrument evidencing the grant of    such Restricted Units so provides.     Payment shall be made in such manner and at such time or times as    provided in such instrument.  If such    instrument so permits, payment with respect to any part or all of an Eligible    Employee s Restricted Units (including related Dividend Equivalent Units) may     

11 

be deferred,    at the Eligible Employee s election, upon such terms and conditions as are    specified in such instrument. 

(e)         Termination  of Employment .  Upon an Eligible  Employee s Termination of Employment for any reason prior to the expiration of  the Restricted Period for any Restricted Shares or Restricted Units (and  related Dividend Equivalent Units) standing to his or her credit immediately  prior to such Termination of Employment, the Eligible Employee s right to  receive payment with respect to such Restricted Shares, Restricted Units and  Dividend Equivalent Units shall be forfeited and cancelled as of the date of  such Termination of Employment, and no payment of any kind shall be made with  respect to such Restricted Shares, Restricted Units and Dividend Equivalent  Units, except as otherwise provided in the instrument or instruments evidencing  the grant of such Shares or Units. 

If  the Committee so determines in its discretion, the instrument evidencing the  Award of such Restricted Shares or Restricted Units may provide that if the  Eligible Employee s Termination of Employment prior to the end of the  Restricted Period established for such Restricted Shares or Restricted Units  occurs as a result of the Eligible Employee s death, Disability, Retirement, or  for any other reason other than discharge by the Corporation or any of its  Affiliated Companies for  cause  as defined in such instrument, payment shall  be made with respect to all or a Pro Rata Portion of such Restricted Shares or  Restricted Units and any related Dividend Equivalent Units .  In such case, only the Eligible Employee s  right to receive payment with respect to any remaining portion of the  Restricted Shares or Restricted Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Units)  for
which such Restricted Period was established shall be cancelled and  forfeited. Any payment required to be made with respect to an Eligible  Employee s Restricted Shares or Restricted Units (and related Dividend  Equivalent Units) pursuant to this paragraph shall be made as soon as  practicable after  the date of such  employee s Termination of Employment, and shall be made in the manner specified  in Section 6(d) 

(f)         Notice  of Code Section 83(b) Election .  A  Participant who files an election under section 83(b) of the Code to include in  gross income the Fair Market Value of any Restricted Shares granted hereunder  while such Shares are still subject to Restrictions shall furnish the  Corporation with a copy of the election so filed by the Participant, within ten  days of the filing of such election with the Internal Revenue Service. 

7.        Awards  of Performance Shares and Performance Units  

Subject  to the limitations set forth in Section 4 and to the other terms and conditions  of the Plan, Performance Shares or Performance Units may be granted to such  Eligible Employees, at such times, in such amounts,  and upon such terms and conditions, as the Committee may  determine in its discretion.   Performance Shares and Performance Units shall be granted in accordance  with the provisions set forth below. 

(a)         Establishment  of Performance Goals and Performance Targets .  In connection with each Award of Performance Shares or  Performance Units, the Committee shall establish in writing, and the instrument  evidencing the grant of such Award shall specify, (i) the Performance Goal or  Goals and the Performance Period that will apply with respect to such Award;  (ii) the level or levels of achievement of the Performance Goal or Goals that  must be met in order for  

12 

payment to be made with respect  to the Award; (iii) the number of Performance Shares that will be issued and  delivered to the recipient of the Award, or the percentage of the Performance  Units (and any related Dividend Equivalent Units) credited to the recipient in  connection with the Award as to which payment will be made, if the Performance  Goal or Goals applicable to such Award (A) have been fully achieved, (B) have  been exceeded, or (C) have not been fully achieved but have been achieved at or  beyond any minimum or intermediate level of achievement specified in the  instrument evidencing the grant of such Award, and (iv) such other terms and  conditions pertaining to the Award as the Committee in its discretion may  determine.  In connection with any such  Award made to any Covered Executive, the matters described in the preceding  sentence shall  be established within  such period of time as may be permitted by the regulations issued
under section  162(m) of the Code. 

(b)         Accounts  and Dividend Equivalent Units for Performance Units Awards.   No Shares shall be issued at the time any  award of Performance Units is made hereunder. Performance Units granted to an  Eligible Employee hereunder shall be credited to a bookkeeping account  maintained by the Corporation for such employee. A separate account shall be  maintained for all Performance Units included in each separate Award of  Performance Units made to an Eligible Employee, and for all Dividend Equivalent  Units that are to be credited with respect to the Performance Units included in  such Award in accordance with the next following sentence. If the instrument  evidencing the grant of any Award of Performance Units so provides, Dividend  Equivalent Units shall be credited with respect to the Performance Units  included in such Award on each Dividend
Payment Date occurring within the  Performance Period applicable to such Award in the same manner as Dividend Equivalent  Units are credited with respect to Restricted Units during the applicable  Restricted Period, as set forth in Section 6(c) above. 

(c)         Limit  on Award Amounts .  The total number  of Shares for which any Award of Performance Shares  may be made to any Eligible Employee, and the total number of  Units for which any Award of Performance Units may be made to any Eligible  Employee (exclusive of any Dividend Equivalent Units credited with respect to  the Performance Units awarded to such employee),  may not exceed 75,000   Shares, or 75,000 Units, for each 12-month period included  in the Performance Period established for such Award. The foregoing limits  shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 13. 

(d)         Performance  Goals for Covered Executives .  In  the case of  any Award of Performance  Shares or Performance Units to any Eligible Employee who is a Covered  Executive, the Performance Goal or Goals established in connection with such  Award shall be based on one or more of the following business criteria, as  determined by the Committee in its discretion: (i) the attainment of specified  levels of, or increases in, the Corporation s after-tax or pretax return on  stockholder s equity, (ii) the attainment of specified levels in the fair  market value of the Corporation s Shares; (iii) the attainment of specified  levels of growth in the value of an investment in the Corporation s Shares,  assuming that all dividends paid on the Corporation s Common Stock are  reinvested in additional Shares; (iv) the
attainment of specified levels of, or  increases in, the Corporation s pre-tax or after-tax earnings, profits, net  income, or earnings per share; (v) the attainment of specified levels of, or  increases in, the Corporation s earnings before income tax, depreciation and  amortization (EBITDA); (vi) attainment of specified levels of, or increases in,  the Corporation s net sales, gross revenues or cash flow from  

13 

operations; (vii) the  attainment of specified levels of, or increases in, the Corporation s working  capital, or in its return on capital employed or invested; (viii) the  attainment of specified levels of, or decreases in, the Corporation s operating  costs or any one or more components thereof, or in the amount of all or any specified  portion of the Corporation s debt or other outstanding financial obligations. 

Any  of the business criteria described in the preceding sentence which the  Committee establishes as a Performance Goal may be measured either by the  performance of the Corporation and its Affiliated Companies on a consolidated  basis, or by the performance of any one or more of the Corporation s  subsidiaries, divisions, or other business units, as the Committee in its  discretion may determine.  In its  discretion, the Committee may also establish Performance Goals, based on any of  the business criteria described in this Section 7(d), that require the  attainment of a specified level of performance of the Corporation, or any of  its subsidiaries, divisions or other business units, relative to the  performance of other specified corporations, in order for such Goals to be met. 

The  Committee may also, in its discretion, include in any Performance Goal the  attainment of which depends on a determination of the net earnings or income of  the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, divisions or other business units,  provisions which require such determination to be made by eliminating the  effects of any decreases in or charges to earnings for (A) the effect of foreign  currency exchange rates, (B) any acquisitions, divestitures, discontinuances of  business operations, restructurings or other special charges, (C) the  cumulative effect of any accounting changes, and (D) any  extraordinary items   as determined under generally accepted accounting principles, to the extent  that such decreases or charges referred to in clauses (A) through (D) are  separately disclosed in the Corporation s Annual Report for each fiscal year  within the applicable Performance
Period. 

(e)         Performance  Goals for Non-Covered Executives .   In the case of Awards of Performance Shares or Performance Units  made  hereunder to Eligible Employees  who are not Covered Executives, the Performance Goal or Goals applicable to  such Awards shall be such corporate or individual goals as the Committee in its  discretion may determine.  

(f)         Measurement  of Performance .  At the end of the  Performance Period established in connection with any Award, the Committee  shall determine the extent to which the Performance Goal or Goals established  for such Award have been attained, and shall determine, on that basis, the  number of Performance Shares or Performance Units included in such Award  that have been earned and as to which  payment   will be made pursuant to section 7(h) below, subject to the adjustments  provide for in Section (7)(g) and the forfeiture provisions of Section  7(i).  In the case of any Award granted  to a Covered Executive, the Committee shall certify in writing the extent to which  it has determined that the Performance Goal or Goals established by it for such  Award have been attained. 

(g)         Adjustment  of Award Amounts .  The Number of  Shares or the amount of cash otherwise payable with respect to an Award on the  basis of the level of attainment of the applicable Performance Goals as  determined by the Committee under Section 7(f) shall be subject to adjustment  in accordance with the following provisions. 

14 

(i)        To    the extent not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan and if the instrument    evidencing  the Award so    provides,  the number of Shares or the    amount of cash otherwise so payable with respect to an Award to an Eligible    Employee who is not a Covered Executive may be increased or decreased to the    extent determined by the Committee in its discretion, based on the    Committee s evaluation of the Eligible Employee s individual performance or    to reflect such other events, circumstances or factors as the Committee in    its discretion deems appropriate in determining the extent to which payment    should be made with respect to the Eligible Employee s Award. 

(ii)       The    Committee shall not have any authority to increase the number of Shares or    the amount of cash otherwise so payable with respect to any Award to a    Covered  Executive.  However, if the instrument evidencing such    Award so provides, the Committee may in its discretion reduce the number of    Shares or the amount of cash otherwise so payable with respect to such Award    (A) to reflect any decreases in or charges to earnings that were not taken    into account pursuant to clause (A), (B), (C), or (D) of Section 7(e) in    determining net earnings or income for purposes of any Performance Goal    established in connection with such Award; (B) to reflect any credits to    earnings for extraordinary items of income or gain that were taken into    account in determining net earnings or income for such purposes; (C) to
reflect the Committee s evaluation of the Covered Executive s individual    performance; or (D) to reflect any other events, circumstances or factors    which the Committee believes to be appropriate in determining the extent to    which payment should be made with respect to the Covered Executive s Award. 

(h)         Payment  of Awards .  Payment with respect to  that number of Performance Shares or Performance Units subject to any Award  which the Committee has determined under Section 7(f) above to have been  earned, as adjusted to the extent determined by the Committee under Section  7(g), shall be made in accordance with the following provisions:  

(i)        In    the case of  any such Performance    Shares, payment  shall be made by the    issuance and delivery to the Participant of a stock certificate for the    requisite number of such Shares. If the instrument evidencing the Award of    such Shares so provides, a cash payment shall also be made to the    Participant, in an amount equal to all of the dividends that would have been    paid to the Participant upon such earned and adjusted number of Shares if    such Shares had been issued to the Participant as of the Date of Grant of the    Award in question.  Such Shares shall    be issued and delivered, and, if applicable, such cash payment shall be made,    to the Participant as soon as practicable after the end of the Performance    Period applicable to the Award in question. 

(ii)       In    the case of any such Performance Units, (including related Dividend    Equivalent Units), payment shall be made (A) by the issuance and delivery to    the Participant of a stock certificate for a number of Shares equal to the    total number of such whole Performance Units and related Dividend Equivalent    Units, and (B) by payment in cash for any fractional Unit in an amount    equal to the Fair Market Value of such fractional Unit determined as of the    Trading Day immediately preceding the date as of which payment is to be    made.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,    payment for such Performance Units (including related Dividend Equivalent    Units) shall be made solely in  

15 

cash, in an    amount equal to the Fair Market Value of all of such Units and any fractional    Unit, determined as of the Trading Day immediately preceding the date as of    which payment is to be made, if the instrument evidencing the grant of such    Performance Units so provides.     Payment shall be made in such manner and at such time or times as    provided in such instrument.  If such    instrument so permits, payment with respect to any part or all of an Eligible    Employee s Performance Units (including any related Dividend Equivalent    Units) may be deferred, at the Eligible Employee s election, upon such terms    and conditions as are specified in such instrument. 

(i)         Termination  of Employment .  Upon an Eligible  Employee s Termination of Employment for any reason prior to the end of the  Performance Period established for any Award of Performance Shares or  Performance Units made to the Eligible Employee hereunder,  such Award shall be cancelled as of the date  of such Termination of Employment, the Eligible Employee s right to receive  payment with respect to any Performance Shares or Performance Units included in  such Award and any Dividend Equivalent Units that were credited with respect to  such Performance Units, shall be forfeited as of such date, and no payment of  any kind shall be made with respect to such Award, except as otherwise provided  in the instrument evidencing the grant of such Award. 

If  the Committee so determines in its discretion, the instrument evidencing  any  Award of Performance Shares or  Performance Units may provide that if the Eligible Employee s Termination of  Employment prior to the end of the Performance Period established for such  Award occurs as a result of the Eligible Employee s death, Disability,  Retirement, or for any other reason other than discharge by the Corporation or  any of its Affiliated Companies for  cause  as defined in such instrument,  payment shall be made at the end of the Performance Period, in accordance with  the provisions of Section 7(h), with respect to all or a Pro Rata Portion of  the number of Shares and/or the amount of cash that otherwise would have been  payable to the Eligible Employee, as determined in accordance with the  provisions of Sections 7(f) and (g), if the Eligible Employee s Termination
of  Employment had not occurred prior to the end of such Performance Period.  In such case, only the Eligible Employee s  right to receive payment with respect to any remaining portion of the  Performance Shares or Performance Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Units)  included in such Award shall be cancelled and forfeited.  

8.        Awards  to Eligible Directors  

Subject  to the limitations set forth in Section 4 and to the other terms and conditions  of the Plan, Annual Award Units shall be granted to Eligible Directors in  accordance with the provisions set forth below: 

(a)         Annual  Grants .  In each fiscal year of the  Corporation beginning with the fiscal year ending July 31, 2006, each member of  the Board of Directors who is an Eligible Director on the Annual Award Grant  Date in such fiscal year shall be entitled to receive 1750 Annual Award Units,  of which 1000 shall be granted on the Annual Award Grant Date (January 5, 2006)  and 750 shall be granted on January 19, 2006.   In each subsequent fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year ending  July 31, 2007, said 1750 Annual Award Units shall automatically be granted on  the Annual Award Grant Date.  If any  Eligible Director has elected not to receive the Annual Award Units to which he  is entitled in any fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending July 31,  2006  

16 

but, prior to the end of such  fiscal year, desires to change his election, the Board of Directors shall have  the power to award to such Eligible Director, before the end of such fiscal  year, the Annual Award Units which he was entitled to receive during such  fiscal year.  Each person who is elected  a director of the Corporation by shareholders at an annual meeting of shareholders  for the first time (i.e., disregarding any previous election of such person by  the Board of Directors) and thereby becomes an Eligible Director shall  automatically be granted 1,000 Annual Award Units on the date of such annual  meeting of shareholders.  

(b)         Accounts  and Dividend Equivalent Units.   No  Shares shall be issued at the time any Annual Award Units are granted  hereunder. Annual Award Units granted to an Eligible Director hereunder shall  be credited to a bookkeeping account maintained by the Corporation for the Eligible  Director. As of each Dividend Payment Date occurring prior to the date on  which  payment with respect to an  Eligible Director s Annual Award Units is made pursuant to (c) below, Dividend  Equivalent Units shall be credited to the Eligible Director s account with  respect to all Annual Award Units (and all Dividend Equivalent Units credited  to such account on all previous Dividend Payment Dates) standing to the  Eligible Director s credit in such account immediately prior to such Dividend  Payment Date. The number of Dividend Equivalent
Units to be so credited shall  be determined in the same manner as Dividend Equivalent Units are credited with  respect to Restricted Units during the applicable Restricted Period, as set  forth in Section 6(c) above. 

(c)         Payment  with respect to Annual Award Units.   Upon an Eligible Director s Termination of Board Membership for  any reason other than removal for cause in accordance with law, the Eligible  Director (or if such Termination has occurred by reason of death, his or her  Beneficiary) shall be entitled to receive payment with respect to all Annual  Award Units and related Dividend Equivalent Units then standing to his or her  credit in the account maintained for the Eligible Director pursuant to (b) above.  Payment shall be made (i) by the issuance  and delivery to the Eligible Director, or to his or her Beneficiary, of a stock  certificate for a number of Shares equal to the number of whole Annual Award  Units and related Dividend Equivalent Units standing to the Eligible Director s  credit immediately prior to such Termination
of Board Membership, and (ii) by  payment in cash for any fractional Annual Award Unit standing to the Eligible  Director s credit at such time.  Payment  shall be made as soon as practicable after the date on which the Eligible  Director s Termination of Board Membership occurs. 

(d)         Forfeiture  of Annual Award Units .  Upon an  Eligible Director s Termination of Board Membership as a result of removal for  cause in accordance with law, all Annual Award Units and related Dividend  Equivalent Units standing to his or her credit immediately prior to such  Termination of Board Membership shall be cancelled as of the date of such  Termination of Board Membership, the Eligible Director s right to receive  payment with respect to such Annual Award Units and Dividend Equivalent Units  shall be forfeited as of such date, and no payment of any kind shall be made  with respect to such Annual Award Units and Dividend Equivalent Units. 

9.        Transferability  of Awards  

Any  Option granted to an Eligible Employee under the Plan shall be nontransferable  and may be exercised during the Eligible Employee s lifetime only by the  Eligible Employee.  A Participant s  right to receive payment of Shares or cash with respect to any other Award  granted  

17 

to the Participant under the  Plan shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale,  transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment, or garnishment by  creditors of the Participant. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing,  if the instrument evidencing the grant of any Award other than an Incentive  Stock Option so provides, the recipient of such Award may transfer his or her  rights with respect to such Award, or any portion thereof, to any  family  member  of the recipient, as that term is defined in the General Instructions  to Form S-8 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the  Securities Act of 1933, as amended, subject to such limitations, terms and  conditions as may be specified in such instrument. 

10.     Listing  and Qualification of Shares    

The Corporation, in its  discretion, may postpone the issuance, delivery, or distribution of Shares with  respect to any Award until completion of such stock exchange listing or other  qualification of such Shares under any state or federal law, rule or regulation  as the Corporation may consider appropriate, and may require any Participant to  make such representations and furnish such information as it may consider appropriate  in connection with the issuance or delivery of the Shares in compliance with  applicable laws, rules and regulations. 

11.     Taxes   

Notwithstanding  any other provision of the Plan, the Corporation or any of its Affiliated  Companies may make such provisions and take such steps as it may deem necessary  or appropriate for the withholding of all federal, state and local taxes  required by law to be withheld with respect to the exercise of any Option or  with respect any payments to be made in respect of any other form of Award  granted to a Participant under the Plan, including but not limited to  (i) deducting the amount of taxes so required to be withheld from any  other compensation or other amounts then or thereafter payable to the Participant,  and/or (ii) withholding delivery of any Shares or payment of any cash amount  otherwise required to be delivered or paid to the Participant with respect to  the exercise of such Option, or with respect to such other form of Award, until  the amount of taxes so required to be
withheld has been paid in full to the  Corporation or any of its Affiliated Companies.  With the approval of the Compensation Committee and subject to  such terms and conditions as it may require, such amount may be paid in Shares  previously owned by the Participant, or by the surrender of a  portion of the Shares that otherwise would  be delivered or paid to such Participant with respect to his or her Award, or  by a combination of payments in cash and Shares. 

12.     Change in  Control  

Notwithstanding  any other provision in the Plan to the contrary (but subject to the   provided ,   however   clause contained in the definition of  Change in Control  in  Section 2), upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the following  provisions shall apply. 

(a)        Each  Option outstanding under the Plan on the day preceding the date on which the  Change in Control occurs shall become immediately and fully exercisable on the  date of the Change in Control, and shall remain fully exercisable, irrespective  of the Participant s  

18 

subsequent Termination of  Employment for any reason, until the date on which the Option otherwise would  expire by the passage of time in accordance with its terms. 

(b)        If  a Change in Control would be treated as having occurred but for the adoption by  the Board of Directors of a resolution described in the   provided ,  however    clause in the definition of  Change in Control  in Section 2, and if such  resolution so provides and has not been rescinded prior to the Change in  Control, the Board  of Directors shall  have the right in its discretion (i) to direct that all Options then  outstanding  and held by Participants shall  be cancelled as of a date to be fixed by the Board,  provided ,  however ,  that not less than 30 days written notice of the date so fixed shall be given  to each such Participant, and each such Participant shall have the right during  such period (irrespective of the Participant s Termination of Employment during  such
period) to exercise his or her Option as to all or any part of the Shares  covered thereby, including any Shares as to which the Option has not yet become  exercisable, or (ii) to authorize the substitution for each outstanding Option  of a new Option, provided that (A) each such new Option has a value at the time  it is granted that is at least equal to the value of the outstanding Option in  substitution for which it is granted, and contains terms and conditions no less  favorable to the Participant than those contained in his or her outstanding  Option, and (B) in the case of any new Incentive Stock Option that is granted  in substitution of an outstanding Incentive Stock Option, the requirements of  section 424(a) of the Code are met with regard to such substitution. 

(c)        The  Restricted Periods applicable to all Restricted Shares and Restricted Units  (including any related Dividend Equivalent Units) granted to a Participant  hereunder that are still outstanding on the day immediately preceding the date  on which such Change in Control occurs shall expire on such date; all  Restrictions applicable to such outstanding Restricted Shares, Restricted Units  and related Dividend Equivalent Units shall lapse on such date; and the  Participant s rights to receive payment with respect to all such outstanding  Shares, Restricted Units and related Dividend Equivalent Units shall become  nonforfeitable as of such date.  Payment  with respect to such outstanding Restricted Shares, Restricted Units and  related Dividend Equivalent Units shall be made at the time or times, and in  the manner, specified in the instrument
or instruments evidencing the grant  thereof, except as the Committee  may  otherwise determine in its discretion at any time prior to the Change in  Control. 

(d)        The  Performance Periods applicable to all Performance Shares and Performance Units  (including any related Dividend Equivalent Units) granted to a Participant  hereunder that  are still outstanding on the day  immediately preceding the date on which such Change in Control occurs shall end  on such date; all Performance Goals that were established in connection with  the Award of such Performance Shares or Performance Units shall be deemed to  have been attained as of such date to the fullest extent necessary in order for  the Participant to be entitled to receive payment with respect to the maximum  number of such Performance Shares, or with respect to the maximum percentage  of  such Performance Units (and any  related Dividend Equivalent Units), as to which payment could be made under the  terms of the applicable Awards, as specified in
the instrument or instruments  evidencing the grant thereof; and the Participant shall acquire on such date a  nonforfeitable right to receive payment with respect to such maximum number of  Performance Shares (including any cash payment with respect to dividends that  would have been paid thereon, if the instrument evidencing the grant of such  shares provides for such  

19 

cash payment), or with respect  to such maximum percentage of Performance Units (and any related Dividend  Equivalent Units), determined without any adjustment under Section 7(g)(i) or  (ii);  provided,   however,  that any Participant who, pursuant to  Section 7(i), would have been entitled to receive payment with respect to only  a Pro Rata Portion of the number of Shares or the amount of cash otherwise  payable with respect to such Performance Shares or Performance Units if no  Change in Control had occurred, shall be entitled to receive only a Pro Rata  Portion of the payment that otherwise would be made with respect to such  Performance Shares or Performance Units under the provisions of this Section  7(d). Payment with respect to such Performance Shares, Performance Units and  related Dividend Equivalent Units shall be made at the time or times, and in  the manner, specified in the instrument or instruments evidencing the grant  thereof,
except as the Committee may otherwise determine in its discretion at  any time prior to the Change in Control. 

(e)        If  any payment that is required to be made hereunder with respect to any  outstanding Award as a result of the occurrence of a Change in Control is to be  made by the issuance and delivery of Shares to the Participant, the Corporation  shall take whatever steps are necessary to cause such Shares to be issued to  the Participant, and to be treated as outstanding, at the effective time of the  transaction constituting the Change in Control. 

13.     Certain  Adjustments to Shares  

In  the event of any change in the shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock  dividend, stock split, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation,  split-up, combination or exchange of shares, or any rights offering to purchase  shares of Common Stock at a price substantially below fair market value, or any  similar change affecting the shares of Common Stock, (i) the maximum  aggregate number and kind of shares specified herein as  available for the grant of Awards, or for  the grant of any particular form of Award, under the Plan, (ii) the number and  kind of shares that may be issued and delivered to Participants upon the  exercise of any Option, or in payment with respect to any Award of Restricted  Shares or Performance Shares, that is outstanding at the time of such change,  (iii) the number and kind of shares represented by any Restricted Units,  Performance Units,
Annual Award Units or Dividend Equivalent Units that are  outstanding at the time of such change, and (iv)  the exercise price per share of any Options granted hereunder  that are outstanding at the time of such change, shall be appropriately  adjusted consistent with such change in such manner as the Compensation  Committee, in its sole discretion, may deem equitable to prevent substantial  dilution or enlargement of the rights granted to, or available for, the  Participants hereunder. 

In  the case of any outstanding Incentive Stock Option, any such change shall be  made in the manner that satisfies the requirements that must be met under  section 424 of the Code in order for such change not to be treated as a   modification  of such Option as defined under section 424 of the Code. 

The  Committee shall give notice to each Participant of any adjustment made pursuant  to this Section and, upon such notice, such adjustment shall be effective and  binding for all purposes. 

20 

14.     Administration  

The  Plan shall be administered in accordance with the provisions set forth below. 

(a)         In  General .  Except as otherwise  specifically provided in the Plan, the Plan shall be administered by (i) the  Board of Directors, with respect to all matters pertaining to Awards that may  be granted or that have been granted hereunder to Eligible Directors; (ii) by  the Compensation Committee, with respect to all matters pertaining to Awards  that may be made or that have been made to Eligible Employees, except as  otherwise provided in (iii); and (iii) by the CEO, with respect to those  specific matters pertaining to Awards to Eligible Employees who are not Elected  Officers that are within the scope of the authority granted to the CEO under  (d) below or delegated by the Compensation Committee to the CEO pursuant to (e)  below.   

(b)         The  Committee s Authority and Powers .   In addition to the responsibilities and powers assigned to the Committee  elsewhere in the Plan, the Committee shall have the authority, in its  discretion, to establish from time to time guidelines or regulations for the  administration of the Plan, to interpret the Plan, and to make all determinations  it considers necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.  All decisions, actions or interpretations of  the Committee under the Plan shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all  parties.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  any determination made by the Committee after the occurrence of a Change in  Control that denies in whole or in part any claim made by any individual for  benefits under the Plan shall be subject to judicial review under a  de novo, 
rather than a deferential, standard. 

(c)         Modification  of Awards .  To the extent not  inconsistent with the terms of the Plan or any provision of applicable law, the  Committee  in its discretion may waive  or modify any of the terms and conditions set forth in the instrument  evidencing the grant of any Award made to a Participant hereunder, including  without limitation, (i) in the case of any Option,  to permit such Option to become exercisable as to any portion of  the Shares subject to the Option at any time earlier than the time specified in  such instrument,  to extend the term of  such Option beyond the date specified in such instrument as the expiration date  for the term of the Option (but not beyond the day immediately preceding the  tenth anniversary of the Date of Grant of the Option), or to permit such  Option, to the extent it has become or becomes
exercisable, to remain  exercisable for any period of time (including any period after the Eligible  Employee s Termination of Employment) beyond the period of time specified in  such instrument but not beyond the date of expiration of the Option, including  any extension thereof permitted under this clause (i); and (ii) in the case of  any Award of Restricted Shares or Restricted Units, to cause the Restricted  Period applicable to such Restricted Shares or restricted Units to expire, and  the Restrictions applicable to such Restricted Shares or Restricted Units to  lapse, as of any date earlier than the date provided for in such instrument;  

Notwithstanding  the foregoing, no waiver or amendment may be authorized or directed by the  Committee pursuant to this Section 14 (c) without the consent of the  Participant if (A) it would adversely affect, to any material extent, any of  the rights or obligations of the Participant with respect to such Award, or (B)  in the case of any Option granted hereunder that was intended to constitute an  Incentive Stock Option, if such waiver or amendment would cause such Option to  fail to be treated as an  incentive stock option  within the meaning of section  422 of the Code. In addition, no such waiver or amendment may be authorized or  directed by the Committee  

21 

pursuant to this Section 14(c)  with respect to any Option, Performance Shares or Performance Units awarded to  any Covered Executive, if such waiver or amendment would cause the delivery of  Shares or the payment of any cash amounts that are made with respect to such  Award to fail to be deductible for federal income tax purposes pursuant to the  applicable provisions of section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations issued  thereunder. 

(d)         The  CEO s Authority and Powers .  With  respect to such number of Shares as the Compensation Committee may in its  discretion determine to be available from time to time for the grant of Awards  in any form to Eligible Employees who are not Elected Officers, the CEO shall  have the authority (i) to determine which of such Eligible Employees shall  receive Awards in each form specified by the Compensation Committee; (ii) to  determine the time or times when Awards in such form shall be made to such  Eligible Employees; (iii) to determine the number of Shares that will be  subject to any Option, or the number of Restricted Shares, Restricted Units,  Performance Shares or Performance Units, to be included in any Award to any  such Eligible Employee; (iv) with respect to any Award of Performance Shares or  Performance Units made to any
such Eligible Employees, to make all  determinations which the Committee is authorized to make with respect to such  Award under the provisions of Section 7(a)(i),(ii) and (iii), Section 7(e) and  Section 7(g)(i); and (v) with respect to any Awards made to any such Eligible  Employees pursuant to the CEO s exercise of the authority granted to him under  this Section 14(d), to exercise all of the authority and powers granted to the  Committee under (b) above and under the second paragraph of (e) below, but only  to the extent that any such exercise by the CEO is not inconsistent with any  action taken by the Compensation Committee, or with any determination, decision  or interpretation of the Plan made by the Compensation Committee, under (b)  above or any delegation made by the Compensation Committee under the second  paragraph of (e) below. 

Except  for the matters specified in the foregoing paragraph and any additional matters  pertaining to Awards to Eligible Employees who are not Elected Officers with  respect to which authority has been granted to the CEO pursuant to (e) below,  the CEO shall not have any of the authority or powers otherwise granted to the  Committee under any other provisions of the Plan. 

The  Compensation Committee in its discretion may at any time, by resolution duly  adopted by it and without any amendment of the Plan, revoke or modify in any  manner or respect the authority and powers granted to the CEO under this  Section 14(d). 

(e)         Delegation .  In addition to the authority and powers  granted to the CEO under (d) above, the Compensation Committee in its  discretion may, by resolution duly adopted by it, delegate to the CEO authority  with respect to such other matters pertaining to Awards to Eligible Employees  who are not Elected Officers as the Compensation Committee may specify in such  resolution.  Any authority so delegated  to the CEO may be revoked or modified by the Compensation Committee, in whole  or in part, at any time. 

The  Committee may delegate any ministerial or nondiscretionary function pertaining  to the administration of the Plan to any one or more officers or other  employees of the Corporation or any of its Affiliated Companies. 

22 

(f)         Non-U.S.  Participants . In order to comply with any applicable provisions of local  law and regulations in any foreign country in which the Corporation or any of  its Affiliated Companies operates, the Committee may in its sole discretion (i)  modify the terms and conditions of Awards granted under the Plan to Eligible  Employees located in such foreign country, (ii) establish subplans with such  modifications to the terms of the Plan as it determines to be necessary or  appropriate under the circumstances applicable in such foreign country, or  (iii) take any other action that it deems necessary or appropriate in order to  comply with, or obtain any exemptions from the applicability of, the local laws  and regulations in such foreign country. 

15.     Designation  and Change of Beneficiary  

Each  Participant shall file with the Committee, or with such employee of the  Corporation who has been designated by the Committee to receive same, a written  designation of one or more persons as the Beneficiary who shall be entitled to  receive any Shares or cash amount payable under the Plan upon or after the  Participant s death.  A Participant may,  from time to time, revoke or change his or her Beneficiary designation without  the consent of any previously designated Beneficiary by filing a new  designation with the Committee or its designee.  The last such designation received by the Committee or its  designee shall  be controlling;  provided ,  however , that no designation, or  change or revocation thereof, shall be effective unless received by the  Committee prior to the Participant s death, and in no event shall it be  effective as of a date prior to such
receipt.   If at the date of a Participant s death, there is no designation of a  Beneficiary in effect for the Participant pursuant to the provisions of this  Section 15, or if no Beneficiary designated by the Participant in  accordance with the provisions hereof survives to receive any Shares or cash  amount payable under the Plan with respect to the Participant after his or  death, the Participant s estate shall be treated as the Participant s  Beneficiary for purposes of the Plan. 

16.     Amendment or  Termination  

The  Board of Directors may, with prospective or retroactive effect, amend, suspend  or terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any time; provided, however,  that (a) no amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan shall adversely  affect the rights of any Participant with respect to any Awards previously  granted to the Participant without his or her written consent, and (b) no  amendment which constitutes a  material revision  of the Plan, as the term  material revision is defined in the applicable rules of the New York Stock  Exchange, shall be effective unless approved by the shareholders of the  Corporation in the manner required by such rules and by applicable law. 

17.     General  Provisions  

(a)         Rights  of Participants .  A Participant s  rights and interests under the Plan shall be subject to the following  provisions: 

(i)        A    Participant shall have the status of a general unsecured creditor of the    Corporation with respect to his or her right to receive any payment under the    Plan.  The Plan shall constitute a    mere promise by the Corporation or the applicable Affiliated Company to make    payments in the future of the benefits provided for herein.  It is  

23 

intended    that the arrangements reflected in the Plan be treated as unfunded for tax    purposes, as well as for purposes of any applicable provisions of Title I of    ERISA. 

(ii)       Neither    the Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as giving any    Participant any right to be retained in the employment of the Corporation or    any of its Affiliated Companies, or shall interfere with the right of the    Corporation or any of its Affiliated Companies with whom the Participant is    employed to terminate the Participant s employment at any time subject,    however, to the Participant s rights under any employment contract in effect    between the Participant and the Corporation or any of its Affiliated    Companies. 

(iii)      No    Award made to a Participant under the Plan, and no payment made with respect    to such Award, shall be considered as compensation under any employee benefit    plan of the Corporation or any of its Affiliated Companies, except as    specifically provided in such plan or as otherwise determined by the Board of    Directors. 

(b)         Successors .  The obligations of the Corporation under the  Plan shall be binding upon any successor corporation or organization resulting  from the merger, consolidation or other reorganization of the Corporation, or  upon any successor corporation or organization succeeding to substantially all  of the assets and business of the Corporation.   The Corporation agrees that it will make appropriate provision for the  preservation of Participants  rights under the Plan in any agreement or plan  which it may enter into or adopt to effect any such merger, consolidation,  reorganization or transfer of assets. 

The  provisions of the Plan and the terms and conditions contained in the instrument  evidencing any Award made to a Participant hereunder shall be binding upon the  Participant, his or her successors and permitted transferees. 

(c)         Governing  Law .  The Plan shall be governed by  and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. 

16.     Effective  Date  

The  Plan was adopted on September 17, 2004 by the Board of Directors, subject,  however, to approval by the shareholders of the Corporation, in accordance with  the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and applicable law, at the 2004  annual meeting of the Corporation s shareholders including any adjournment  thereof.  The effective date of the Plan  shall be the date of such approval by the Corporation s shareholders, and no  Awards may be granted hereunder prior to such date.
