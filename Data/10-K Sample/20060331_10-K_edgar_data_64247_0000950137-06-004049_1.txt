Narrative Description of Business 

Business   

Overview  

We are a contract manufacturer of highly engineered metal
components and subassemblies for construction, industrial, and
agricultural original equipment manufacturers
( OEM s ). Our products include engine
enclosures, panels, platforms, frames, tanks and other
components used in backhoes, excavators, tractors, wheel
loaders, power generators, turf care equipment and similar
industrial equipment. Our products are typically highly
engineered, cosmetically sensitive, require structural strength
and contain complex weldments.

Our largest customers include Deere & Co.
( Deere ) and Caterpillar Inc.
( Caterpillar ) who together generated 91% of our
2005 net sales. Our five manufacturing facilities are
located in the Midwestern and Southeastern United States in
close proximity to our customers. We have no foreign operations.

2

Markets   

Customers use our products in construction, industrial, and
agricultural equipment. As OEM s in these industries have
intensified their focus on core competencies, they have
increasingly outsourced more of their production parts to reduce
costs. To effectively manufacture products for OEMs, suppliers
must invest in technologically advanced equipment, develop
in-house design capabilities, and coordinate manufacturing and
product delivery with their customers.

Historically, our largest customers, Deere and Caterpillar, have
been supplied by a large number of local suppliers that would
each produce a small number of products. As these OEMs have
increased the complexity of their equipment and become more
dependent on component and subassembly suppliers, they have
reduced the size of their supplier base and have established
close relationships with a smaller number of sophisticated
suppliers who can provide a range of services, including design
engineering, prototyping, sophisticated quality systems, and
 just-in -time delivery.
The high levels of service necessary to serve these customers,
coupled with significant tooling investments, have resulted in
the sole-sourcing of many products rather than dual or
multi-sourcing. Currently, we are the sole-source provider of
over 90% of the products that we supply to our customers. As
these customers continue to reduce the size of their supplier
base and outsource a growing percentage of their product needs,
we expect to become the sole-source provider on an increasing
number of products.

Virtually all of our customers are located in the United States,
and we do not have material sales to foreign customers.
Considering our relatively low volume of parts manufactured, the
cosmetic sensitivity of those parts, and the bulk involved in
shipping those parts, we believe that our customers prefer to
source those parts domestically.

Construction Equipment  

The $18 billion U.S. construction equipment industry
includes construction, earth moving and forestry equipment, as
well as some material handling equipment, lifts, off-highway
trucks and a variety of machines for specialized industrial
applications. Caterpillar and Deere dominate the
U.S. construction equipment industry, and together
accounted for an estimated 50% of total U.S. unit sales in
2005. We supply metal components and subassemblies, such as
engine enclosures, platforms, frames and complex weldments. Our
customers use these products in backhoes, excavators, wheel
loaders, skid-steer loaders, lifts and similar construction
equipment. Our sales per construction equipment vehicle range up
to $2,500. Construction equipment products accounted for
approximately 64% of our 2005 net sales.

Industrial Equipment  

We produce a range of components and subassemblies for equipment
used in a variety of industrial applications, including store
fixtures, motor homes, turf care equipment and power generators.
Customers in the industrial equipment area generally serve
stable or growth markets, and these customers include
Caterpillar, Deere, Kubota, Hallmark, Winnebago and JLG
Industries Inc. Industrial equipment products accounted for
approximately 19% of our 2005 net sales.

Agricultural Equipment  

The $15 billion U.S. agricultural equipment industry
includes large, relatively expensive products such as tractors,
combines and other farming equipment. Deere and Caterpillar
accounted for an estimated 35% of total U.S. agricultural
equipment unit sales in 2005. We supply metal components and
subassemblies such as steps, grills, and landing decks. Our
sales per agricultural equipment vehicle range from $200 to
$3,000. Agricultural equipment products accounted for
approximately 17% of our 2005 net sales.

3

Products   

Our investments in modern equipment and systems have allowed us
to produce a broad line of highly engineered components and
subassemblies. We strive to meet customers  needs for
design engineering, prototyping, product fabrication and
 just-in -time delivery.

Sheet Metal Fabrication  

Our sheet metal fabrication capabilities include laser and
plasma cutting, forming, punching, welding, painting and
assembly processes. Our sheet metal fabrication processes
operate on information created by CAD/ CAM software, utilize
optic laser cutting machines to cut parts at high speeds and use
robotic welders to complement manual welding operations. Our
painting operations are capable of producing the wide variety of
paint finishes required by customers.

Fabricated Sheet Metal Products Include:

Sheet Metal Enclosures and Boxes    generator
    set enclosures, electrical and battery boxes, panels, doors,
    hoods and covers used in backhoes, excavators and tractors. 

Special Weldments    seat modules, frames,
    guards, platforms, step assemblies and cabs used in backhoes,
    excavators, crawlers, tractors and skid steer loaders. 

Fabricated Steel Tanks    fuel and hydraulic
    fluid reservoirs used in motor graders, trucks, crawlers, wheel
    loaders and excavators. 

Sheet Metal Component Packages    laser cut and
    formed parts that are used in higher level assemblies at
    customer locations. These products include brackets, plates and
    frame components that are used in a wide variety of customer end
    products. 

Store Fixtures    back frames, lights and
    brackets used in store displays and commercial refrigeration
    units. 

Services   

We offer our customers a number of services described below:

Product Design and Development  

This service category includes design, development, analysis and
costing for our products. We prefer to and often work with
customers in the early stages of designing their products.

Prototyping/ Tooling  

This service category includes prototyping, tooling and
pre-production steps in the manufacturing process. Our dedicated
prototype and tooling departments work with customers throughout
development efforts, allowing for a smooth introduction of new
products.

Part Decorating and Exterior Finishing  

This service category includes a number of decorating operations
such as liquid and powder coat painting and decal application.

Just-In-Time Delivery  

This service category includes providing customers the ability
to order products in low lot sizes with minimal lead time
enabling them to reduce their overall order cycle time. We also
provide deliveries that are specially sequenced to
customers  manufacturing schedules.

Engineering and Design Capabilities  

Engineering capabilities have become increasingly emphasized as
suppliers provide design services for new projects. Computer
aided design capabilities include Pro/ ENGINEER, Anvil
1000/5000, Apollo, Merry Mechanization and CADKEY. We have
focused our computer aided design investment on the Pro/
ENGINEER system during the last several years because Pro/
ENGINEER is the preferred system of the majority of our
customers. Computer aided design allows us to download completed
and approved designs directly to production equipment in most
plants. The resulting direct interaction between customers 
designers and our engineers facilitates joint development of new
components and redesign of old parts.

Systems and Controls  

Consistent with our emphasis on technology, computer systems and
controls are an integral part of our operating strategy. We have
invested heavily in management information systems and computer
aided design capabilities and control functions, particularly
during the last several years. We also use computer systems to
provide timely performance measurements of shop floor quality
and activity, daily actual cost information for each factory,
electronic data interchange with major customers, real-time
dispatching of work orders, integration of purchasing
information with production scheduling, capacity management and
inventory information.

Sales and Marketing 

To better serve our customers, we have combined our sales and
engineering organizations. The sales and engineering group has
primary responsibility for managing relationships with customers
and working with them to design new products. Our customers are
serviced by account teams led by an account manager and include
representatives from our primary functional areas. These areas
include engineering and customer service. Account teams work
with the customer to design products and produce prototypes,
schedule production and monitor quality and customer
satisfaction. Our account managers also lead the new business
development process, working with customers to obtain details of
new outsourcing programs, new products currently being designed
and existing products which will be redesigned. We believe that
the structure of our sales and marketing organization helps to
ensure cooperation in product design and helps us to gain repeat
and new business from our customers.

Manufacturing/ Production 

We use a range of manufacturing processes to serve the needs of
our customers. Using these processes, we can manufacture
products ranging from simple metal parts to more complex metal
subassemblies. Our design and engineering capabilities provide
us with a competitive edge in obtaining and maintaining
preferred supplier status with our customers.

Sheet Metal Fabrication.  Our sheet metal fabrication
capabilities include laser cutting, punching, forming, folding,
welding, painting and assembly processes. Our sheet metal
fabrication processes, operating on information created by Pro/
ENGINEERING software, use optic laser cutting machines to cut
parts at high speeds. We use robotic welders to complement our
manual welding operations. Our painting operations are capable
of producing the wide variety of paint finishes required by our
customers.

Raw Materials 

The primary raw materials that we use are sheet steel, assembly
parts and paint. Prices of these raw materials fluctuate,
although the price of our most significant raw material, steel,
increased dramatically during 2004 and stabilized in 2005. The
prices have increased modestly in 2006. The steel supply
tightened, due in part to the national economic recovery,
China s growing steel consumption, and reduced domestic
steel production capacity. We were able to negotiate with our
customers to have them absorb substantial amounts of the
increases in our raw material costs in 2004 and 2005. Effective
in 2005 and through early 2006, the price increases have been
incorporated into unit prices for those parts manufactured for
our customers. We also participate in the steel purchase
programs of certain major customers which lowers our cost for
steel.

5

Generally, we purchase our raw materials from multiple
suppliers, and we believe that the prices we obtain are
competitive.

Competition 

The manufacturing and supplying of highly engineered metal
products to original equipment manufacturers is a fragmented and
highly competitive business, with no single supplier having
significant market share. We believe suppliers with a strong
management team, a range of capabilities, modernized facilities
and technologically sophisticated equipment like us are more
likely to benefit from original equipment manufacturers 
increased outsourcing of production than other participants in
the industry lacking such assets. However, competitive pressures
or other factors could cause us to lose market share or could
result in significant price erosion with respect to our products.

Regulatory/ Environmental Matters 

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local
environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations.
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with such laws
and regulations and have not budgeted any material capital
expenditures for environmental control facilities.

Financial Information about Industry Segments 

We have one reportable segment   contract metal
fabrication. The contract metal fabrication segment provides
full-service fabrication of parts and sub-assemblies for the
construction, agricultural and industrial equipment industries.

Backlog 

Our backlog of orders was approximately $135.0 million at
December 31, 2005, and $120.0 million at
December 31, 2004. We anticipate that we will substantially
fill all of the December 31, 2005 backlog orders during
2006.

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, and Concessions;
Research and Development 

We hold no material patents, trademarks, franchises, or
concessions. We are the licensee under a number of software
licenses that we use in our design, production, and other
business operations. All of these licenses have customary terms
and conditions. Our research and development expenditures are
not material.

Working Capital Items 

Our working capital requirements reflect several business
factors. Our working capital requirements are typically greater
during the second half of the calendar year because both Deere
and Caterpillar suspend operations for two weeks of vacation
time during July and/or August. Production operations of both of
these customers also slow down during the last two weeks of
December. During these periods, we must rely more heavily on our
credit facilities for liquidity. Additional discussion regarding
working capital can be found in Item 7, Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.

Employees 

As of February 25, 2006, we had 1,370 employees, of whom
1,152 were hourly and 218 were salaried. None of these employees
are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our
relationship with our employees is good.

Significant Past Events of the Business 

On January 20, 1998, Morton Metalcraft Holding Co. and its
subsidiaries ( Morton ) merged (the
 Merger ) with MLX Corp. ( MLX ), with MLX
being the surviving corporation. As a result of the Merger,
Morton ceased to exist as a separate corporate entity and MLX
amended its Articles of Incorporation to change the corporate
name of MLX to Morton Industrial Group, Inc. (the Company).
Morton was engaged in the business of manufacturing fabricated
metal components for construction and agricultural original
equipment manufacturers and other industrial customers.

On April 15, 1999, we acquired from Worthington Custom
Plastics three manufacturing facilities that produced plastic
components for industrial original equipment manufacturers. The
Worthington acquisition expanded our plastic product offerings
to include appliance parts, electronics housings and other
injection molded and thermoformed plastic products. These
plastics facilities operated as Morton Custom Plastics, LLC
(MCP, LLC). On November 1, 2002, MCP, LLC, filed for
protection as
 debtor-in -possession
under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in
the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.
Before filing, MCP, LLC had negotiated the terms of an agreement
for sale of substantially all of its assets to Wilbert, Inc.,
pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement. Under the agreement,
Wilbert, Inc. was also to assume the liabilities of MCP, LLC
under certain of their contracts and leases. This sales
transaction closed on December 24, 2002, with the cash
consideration applied to the reduction of MCP, LLC s senior
secured debt. The Company also operated an injection molding
business in Iowa until that operation was sold in June 2003.
These sales allowed the Company to focus on its core competency,
manufacturing fabricated sheet metal.

Item 1A.  
     
      Risk Factors   

We are subject to various risk factors, the exercise of which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations, including:

The loss of either of our two largest customers or the material
    reduction in purchases by either or both of them. 

Significant industry-wide declines in the sales of construction,
    industrial, or agricultural equipment. 

The unavailability of raw materials such as steel in volumes or
    at times required to meet production needs and customer orders. 

Increases in the prices of raw materials that cannot be passed
    through to customers in full or material part. 

The lack of sufficient working capital to meet production
    requirements or growth opportunities. 

Increases in interest rates that increases the costs of our
    indebtedness and the reduce the availability of capital. 

General economic conditions and the cyclicality of our
    customers  businesses.

Item 3.  
     
      Legal Proceedings   

Worthington 

On May 1, 2000, Worthington Industries, Inc.
( Worthington ) filed suit (in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern
Division ( the Court )) against us and Morton Custom
Plastics, LLC ( MCP, LLC ) related to MCP, LLC s
1999 acquisition of the non-automotive plastics business from
Worthington. Worthington claimed that it was owed additional
amounts under the sale agreement and a related service
agreement, and that it was owed dividends on shares of our
preferred stock that it received. We believed that certain
warranties and representations made by Worthington at the time
of acquisition were breached and that amounts claimed by
Worthington were not due. We had filed a counterclaim against
Worthington related to these matters.

In connection with a preferred stock redemption agreement dated
December 23, 2003, the parties settled all litigation
between the Company and Worthington. The Court entered an order
of dismissal of the Worthington lawsuit on January 20, 2004.

The preferred stock redemption agreement dated December 23,
2003 provides for 30 monthly redemption payments of $50,000
each (totaling $1.5 million) over a three year period (10
payments each year in 2004, 2005 and 2006) to fully redeem the
$10.0 million face value of the redeemable preferred stock.
Each $50,000 payment and redemption of 333 (or 334) shares
reduces the outstanding balance of the redeemable preferred
stock by $333,000 (or $334,000). As of March 24, 2006, the
Company has paid timely 23 of the 30 scheduled redemption
payments. The redemption payments made in 2004 and 2005 resulted
in the recognition of a gain

8

on redemption of preferred stock of $2,833,000 for each of the
years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, which is reflected
in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company is also involved in routine litigation. Management
does not believe any legal proceedings would have a material
adverse effect on the Company s financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

described in Item 7, we issued to our lenders 545,467
warrants (which expire March 26, 2014) to purchase
Class A shares of common stock at an exercise price of
$0.02 per share. The number of warrants may decline over
the first five years following the related refinancing
agreements based on the Company achieving specified EBITDA
(earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization)
levels, or achieving certain stated levels of net equity. The
Company achieved the specified EBITDA levels for 2004 and 2005,
and, accordingly, the maximum number of warrants that can be
exercised is 415,128. None of these warrants have been exercised
as of March 24, 2006.

As of December 31, 2005, under our 1997 Stock Option Plan
(which was approved by our shareholders), issued and outstanding
stock options are as follows:

In addition to these options, we have reserved for future grants
an additional 327,561 shares.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included
elsewhere in this annual report.

General 

We are a contract manufacturer of highly engineered metal
components and subassemblies for construction, industrial and
agricultural original equipment manufacturers. Our largest
customers, Caterpillar and Deere, accounted for approximately
91% and 87% of our net sales in 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Historically, the Company has been a fabricator of sheet metal
products. Subsequent to a merger in January, 1998, when the
Company became a publicly-traded entity, the Company acquired
six facilities that fabricated either injection molded or
thermoformed plastic components. Two of the plastics fabrication
facilities were acquired separately in 1998, and four were
acquired together in 1999. One of the plastics fabrication
facilities acquired in 1998 was sold at the end of 1999. The
four plastics fabrication facilities acquired together in 1999
were sold in December 2002. These four facilities, operating as
Morton Custom Plastics, LLC, were incurring significant losses
and, in 2002, filed for protection as
 debtor-in -possession
under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. At
the time of the sale of Morton Custom Plastics, LLC, the Company
determined that is was appropriate to focus solely on its core
competency, sheet metal fabrication, and offered for sale its
remaining plastics fabrication facility, which was sold in June
2003. In the Company s accompanying consolidated statements
of operations for 2003, all of the plastics fabrication results
are reported as discontinued operations.

As a part of the 1999 plastics facilities acquisition, the
Company issued $10.0 million of redeemable preferred stock
with a maturity date of April 2004. The Company negotiated a
settlement in December 2003 with the holder of the preferred
stock, and began making redemption payments in January 2004. If
the redemption payments are paid according to the terms of the
settlement agreement, the payments will aggregate
$1.5 million over a three-year period ending in 2006.
Through March 24, 2006, all scheduled payments have been
made timely; twenty-three of the thirty scheduled redemption
payments have been made.

Since June 2003, the Company has focused solely on its core
business, sheet metal fabrication (the Company s continuing
operations). The Company recognized earnings from its continuing
operations in 2003, 2004 and 2005, but had incurred losses from
its continuing operations in 2001 and 2002 when demand by the
Company s customers was depressed.

To take advantage of the potential for growth in 2004 and
beyond, and to be able to effectively serve our customers, we
needed to be able to ensure an adequate flow of raw materials
into our production processes, hire and train additional
employees, fund our need for new manufacturing equipment and
meet our other working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company
entered into a new credit facility in March 2004 that is
described below. The new credit facility provided additional
availability at the closing of approximately $5.0 million.
Management believes that the new credit facility has permitted
to date, and will continue to permit, the Company to meet its
liquidity requirements which are driven by raw material,
manpower and capital expenditure requirements, through the term
of the facility, which matures in March 2008.

As noted above, two customers account for a significant portion
of our net sales. Caterpillar and Deere continue to forecast
greater orders for fabricated parts supplied by Morton
Metalcraft Co. We believe that this demand is being fueled by
the improved economic conditions in the United States. The
Company has responded by hiring additional manpower, adding
capital equipment as necessary and increasing the flow of
purchased raw materials in a difficult steel market. The
U.S. steel industry has restructured, consolidated and is
challenged to meet growing domestic and international demand.
The steel industry has been impacted by China s growing
consumption of scrap steel and coke, a raw material used in
processing steel. Cosmetically

12

sensitive sheet steel, our core commodity, has seen significant
price increases; most steel price increases have been passed
through to our customers.

In pricing our products, we consider the volume of the product
to be manufactured, required engineering resources and the
complexity of the product. Our customers typically expect us to
offset any manufacturing cost increases with improvements in
production flow, efficiency, productivity or engineering
redesigns. As a part of their supplier development programs, our
primary customers initiate cost improvement efforts on a regular
basis. At the conclusion of any such effort, when savings can be
documented, we share the savings with our customer.

On March 22, 2006, Morton Industrial Group, Inc. (the
Company) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
( Merger Agreement ) under which MMC Precision Merger
Corp. ( Merger Sub ), a wholly owned subsidiary of MMC
Precision Holdings Corp. ( Parent ), will merge with
and into the Company with the Company being the surviving
corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The
shareholders of Parent will include a private equity fund that
is an affiliate of Brazos Private Equity Partners, LLC, which
will hold a majority of the shares of Parent, and five persons
who are (i) William D. Morton, the Company s Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer, (ii) through his
affiliate Eastover Group, LLC, Mark W. Mealy, a director of the
Company, (iii) Daryl R. Lindemann, the Company s
Senior Vice President of Finance, (iv) Brian L. Geiger,
Senior Vice President of Operations of Morton Metalcraft Co.,
and (v) Brian R. Doolittle, Senior Vice President of Sales
and Engineering of Morton Metalcraft Co.. In the Merger, each
outstanding share of common stock of the Company, other than
shares to be contributed to Parent by Mr. Morton,
Mr. Mealy, and the other three officers concurrently with
the closing of the Merger, will be converted to the right to
receive $10.00 cash per share.

Results of Operations 

The following table presents certain historical financial
information expressed as a percentage of our net sales.

The following table presents certain historical information
(000 s):

Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 were
$196.3 million compared to $185.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $10.8 million
or 5.8%. The increase in sales dollars is attributable primarily
to steel surcharges as described below. Unit sales dollars
remained relatively flat in 2005 compared with 2004. Our 2005
construction-related revenues increased by approximately
$9.9 million over the comparable year and accounted for
nearly 64% of our 2005 revenue. Industrial related revenues
decreased by approximately $5.8 million and
agricultural-related revenues increased by $6.7 million in
2005. Sales for 2005 and 2004 included steel surcharges passed
through to our customers of approximately $28.6 million and

13

$18.2 million, respectively. Sales to Caterpillar and Deere
were approximately 91% and 87% of our net sales for 2005 and
2004, respectively.

Based upon customer forecasts, the Company currently anticipates
modest revenue growth for calendar year 2006. Our ability to
generate sales at these higher levels is subject to a number of
factors, including the continuing demand that we now forecast,
the availability of raw materials, principally steel, and the
availability of working capital to support that growth. During
2004, steel prices increased as the steel supply tightened, due
in part to the national economic recovery, China s growing
steel consumption, and reduced domestic steel production
capacity. Steel prices stabilized in 2005 at relatively high
levels, and are increasing modestly in 2006. Generally we have
been able to negotiate with our customers to have them absorb
increases in our raw material costs.

Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2005 was
$26.8 million compared with $23.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $3.2 million
or 13.9%. The Company s gross profit percentage increased
to 13.7% from 12.7%. The gross profit amount increased primarily
as a result of the increased sales; while the percentage
increased as a result of the Company s continuing focus on
cost savings programs including 6 Sigma and various lean
manufacturing concepts. The gross profit percentage was
negatively impacted by approximately 2.3% by passing through to
customers, at cost with no margin, the impact of increased steel
prices in the form of surcharges described above. The Company
believes that certain cost efficiencies will be achievable in
2006 that will continue to strengthen the gross margins. The
Company also anticipates continued pricing pressure from its
customers in 2006 that will offset some of the cost
efficiencies. We use internal metrics to measure our success in
achieving various productivity, quality, on-time delivery and
profitability goals.

Selling and administrative expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2005 amounted to $15.8 million, or 8.1%
of sales, compared with to $14.4 million, or 7.8% of sales
in the prior year. This increased cost, and the increase in
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales
relates to the increase in sales and to non-recurring expenses
of $0.5 million related to exploring recapitalization
opportunities.

Interest expense in 2005 amounted to $6.2 million compared
to $4.9 million in 2004. The Company refinanced its debt on
March 26, 2004 as described below. The refinancing includes
senior subordinated debt with cash interest at 12% and
 payment-in -kind
interest at approximately 4%. Interest expense for 2005 also
includes charges related to amortization of debt discount of
$376,000 (compared to $341,000 in 2004) and the increase in the
value of the warrants liability of $1,081,000 (compared to
$291,000 in 2004); both of these charges relate to warrants
issued in March 2004. Interest expense for 2005 also includes
the amortization of deferred financing costs of $448,000
(compared to $396,000 in 2004).

Other income of $60,000 and $172,000 in 2005 and 2004,
respectively, resulted from interest income on the notes
receivable related to the 2003 sale of the operations
Mid-Central Plastics, Inc.

Interest on redeemable preferred stock  relates to
the accretion of the discount on redeemable preferred stock
during the first four months of 2004, at which time the stock
was fully accreted. This classification in other expense
resulted from the implementation of SFAS Statement
No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity (SFAS 150).

Gain on redemption of preferred stock of $2,833,000 in each of
the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, resulted from
the preferred stock redemption described above. This redemption
process began in January 2004.

We recognized an income tax benefit of $4.0 million in
2005; this represents the recognition of deferred Federal and
state income tax benefits of $5.1 million, net of
provisions of $140,000 for Federal tax and $940,000 for state
income taxes. Net deferred tax assets, increased from
$8.1 million at December 31, 2004 to
$13.2 million at December 31, 2005 as a result of a
reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
Realization of the $13.2 million of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon generation of future taxable income of
approximately $34 million.

14

Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 were
$185.5 million compared to $131.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $54.1 million
or 41.1%. The volume portion of the sales increase, totaling
approximately $35.9 million, resulted primarily from
increased unit demand by existing customers of
construction-related equipment components and an increase in
industrial components to new customers. Our 2004
construction-related revenues increased by approximately
$25.0 million over the comparable year and accounted for
nearly 65% of our 2004 revenue. Industrial related revenues
increased by approximately $7.3 million and
agricultural-related revenues increased modestly in 2004. In
addition, sales for 2004 included steel surcharges passed
through to our customers of approximately $18.2 million.
Most of the revenue growth came from increased unit sales to our
two largest customers, Deere & Co. and Caterpillar Inc.
Sales to Caterpillar and Deere were approximately 87% and 88% of
our net sales for 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2004 was
$23.6 million compared with $18.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $5.5 million
or 30.1%. The Company s gross profit percentage decreased
to 12.7% from 13.8%. The gross profit amount increased primarily
as a result of the increased sales; while the percentage
decreased as a result of incremental costs incurred during a
period of significant growth, including overtime, training and
material handling. The gross profit percentage was negatively
impacted by approximately 1.4% by passing through to customers,
at cost with no margin, the effect of increased steel prices in
the form of surcharges described above.

Selling and administrative expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2004 amounted to $14.4 million, or 7.8%
of sales, compared with $12.6 million, or 9.6% of sales in
the prior year. This increased cost, and the reduction in
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales
relates primarily to the increase in sales.

Interest expense in 2004 amounted to $4.9 million compared
to $3.9 million in 2003. The Company refinanced its debt on
March 26, 2004 as described below. The refinancing includes
senior subordinated debt with cash interest at 12% and
 payment-in -kind
interest at approximately 4%; interest expense for 2004 also
includes charges related to amortization of debt discount of
$341,000 and the increase in the value of the warrants liability
of $291,000; both of these charges relate to warrants issued in
March 2004. Interest expense for 2004 also includes the
amortization of deferred financing costs of $396,000 (compared
to $779,000 in 2003).

Other income of $172,000 in 2004 resulted from interest income
on the notes receivable related to the sale of the operations
Mid-Central Plastics. Other income in 2003 resulted primarily
from an unrealized gain on interest rate swaps of $337,000 and
interest income of $105,000 on the notes receivable related to
the sale of the operations of Mid-Central Plastics.

Interest on redeemable preferred stock  relates to
the accretion of the discount on redeemable preferred stock
during the first four months of 2004, at which time the stock
was fully accreted, and for the six months ended
December 31, 2003. This classification in other expense
resulted from the implementation of SFAS Statement
No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity (SFAS 150).
For the first six months of 2003, the accretion was classified
as  accretion of discount on preferred shares .

Gain on redemption of preferred stock of $2,833,000 results from
the preferred stock redemption described above. This redemption
process began in January 2004.

We recognized an income tax benefit of $5.8 million in
2004; this represents the recognition of deferred Federal and
state income tax benefits of $6.5 million, net of
provisions of $185,000 for Federal tax and $540,000 for state
income taxes. Net deferred tax assets, increased from
$1.6 million at December 31, 2003 to $8.1 million
at December 31, 2004 as a result of a reduction in the
deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Realization of the
$8.1 million of deferred tax assets is dependent upon
generation of future taxable income of approximately
$22.0 million.

The 2003 income from discontinued operations represents the
results of the operations of Mid-Central Plastics, Inc. through
the date of sale of those operations in June 2003.

Financial Position and Liquidity 

Historically, we have funded our business with cash generated
from operations, management of our working capital and
borrowings under revolving credit and term loan facilities. In
the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2005 we generated
cash from operating activities of $10.3 million and
$11.1 million, respectively. In 2004, we used
$0.2 million of cash in operations. We generated cash from
operations in 2005 primarily as a result of earning nearly
$11.0 million of operating income and having a use of cash
to support increases in inventories and receivables, net of an
offsetting increase in accounts payable. Our capital
expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004
and 2005 were $4.1 million, $5.4 million and
$6.5 million, respectively. These capital expenditures were
principally for additions or to improve our manufacturing
capacity and efficiency.

Our consolidated working capital at December 31, 2005 was
$2.4 million compared with $6.4 million at
December 31, 2004. This represents a decrease in working
capital of approximately $4.0 million. This working capital
decrease results primarily from the inclusion of
$3.7 million of debt prepayments required as a result of
excess cash flows (described below) in current installments of
long-term debt.

On March 26, 2004, the Company entered into a Second
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks
led by Harris Trust and Savings Bank, As Agent (referred to as
the Harris syndicate), and also on March 26, 2004, entered
into a Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement with BMO Nesbitt
Burns Capital (U.S.) Inc., As Agent. These agreements were
effective on March 26, 2004, and provided financing to
replace the revolving credit facility and term note payable due
to a former Harris syndicate. In connection with this
transaction, the 238,584 warrants to purchase Class A
Common Stock were surrendered by the holders; and, as described
below, new warrants were issued on March 26, 2004.

On June 23, 2004, the Company entered into the First
Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
and also on June 23, 2004, entered into an Amended and
Restated Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement with BMO Nesbitt
Burns Capital (U.S.) Inc., As Agent. The effect of the
June 23, 2004 amendments was to increase the amount due to
BMO Nesbitt Burns Capital (U.S.) Inc., As Agent, by $2,000,000,
reduce the balance outstanding under the four-year secured term
loan described below by $1,000,000 and reduce the balance
outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility
described below by $1,000,000.

Under the terms of the new agreements and subsequent amendments,
effective as of June 23, 2004, and as of December 31,
2005, the Company has:

16

revolving credit facility is limited to 85% of eligible accounts
    receivable and 60% of eligible inventories. The facility
    requires a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum on the unused
    portion of the facility. 

At the Company s option, for both the secured term loan and
    the secured revolving credit facility, interest will be at
    either a bank base rate plus applicable margin, or an adjusted
    LIBOR plus a LIBOR applicable margin. At inception, the bank
    rate plus applicable margin was 6.75% and the adjusted LIBOR
    plus a LIBOR applicable margin was 5.35%. At December 31,
    2004 those rates were 7.75% and 6.78%, respectively, and at
    December 31, 2005, those rates were 9.25% and 7.97%,
    respectively. 

The Company entered into a swap agreement effective
    June 30, 2004 related to $10,750,000 (the original notional
    amount) of its term debt. The swap agreement is for the purpose
    of limiting the effects of interest rate increases on
    approximately one-half of the Company s variable rate term
    debt. Under this agreement, the Company pays a fixed rate of
    3.72% on the notional amount, which is payable quarterly. In
    accordance with the term loan agreement, the Company also pays
    an interest margin which adjusts in steps based on achieved
    operating and leverage metrics (4.00% during the first three
    months of 2005, and then reducing to 3.50%). The notional amount
    as of December 31, 2005 was $8,875,000. The swap agreement
    expires March 31, 2008 

3) Senior secured subordinated notes totaling $12,000,000
    with cash interest of 12% and
     payment-in -kind
    interest of 2% or 4% with no principal amortization, and the
    balances due March 26, 2009. This debt is subordinated to
    the secured term loan and the revolving credit facility with
    respect to both payment and lien priority. The balance as of
    December 31, 2005 is $12,771,000 (reported as $11,988,000,
    reflecting a discount of $783,000). 

Related to the senior secured subordinated note, on
    March 26, 2004, the Company issued 545,467 warrants to
    purchase shares of its Class A Common Stock for
    $0.02 per share; these warrants expire March 26, 2014.
    The warrant holder may exercise the warrants at any time. The
    warrants may be put to the Company, at their then fair market
    value, at the earlier of: a) five years from the date of
    issue; b) a change of control; c) a default on the
    senior secured subordinated loan; or d) a prepayment of 75%
    or more of the original principal balance of the senior secured
    subordinated loan. 

The Company estimated the fair value of the warrants at the date
of issue, and as of December 31, 2004 and 2005, to be
$1,500,000, $1,791,000 and $2,872,000, respectively. These
estimates are reported as warrants payable in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets for 2004 and 2005. The fair value
allocated to the warrants at the date of issue resulted in the
recognition of an equal amount of debt discount, which is being
amortized using the effective yield method over 5 years,
the term of the related senior secured subordinated note. The
Company reports the warrants at fair value and records changes
in the fair value as interest expense.

The stock purchase warrant includes provisions that will reduce
the number of warrants that can be put to the Company below
545,467 if a) a change of control occurs prior to
5 years from the date of issue and the Company achieves
specified net equity levels; or b) if a change of control
has not occurred prior to 5 years from the date of issue
and the Company achieves specified EBITDA (earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) levels. The
number of warrants could be reduced to any one of several
levels, but no lower than 290,278. For the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2005, the Company achieved the EBITDA
level that would reduce the maximum number of warrants
outstanding. The maximum number of warrants that may be put or
exercised has been reduced to 415,128 as of December 31,
2005.

The Company has provided bank letters of credit totaling
approximately $2,086,000 to two creditors. One letter of credit
is in support of operating lease payments; this letter of credit
is for $388,000 and will be in effect through the entire term of
certain leases that expire in December 2011, unless released
earlier; the other letters of credit, in the aggregate amount of
$1,698,000 support future potential payments by the Company
related to workers  compensation claims. These letters of
credit will renew on an annual basis until the need for the
letters of credit expires. Based on workers  compensation
claims experience, the amount of these letters of credit is
subject to adjustment on December 31, 2006. The outstanding
letters of credit decrease, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the
amount of revolving line of credit available under the secured
revolving credit facility.

17

In connection with these loans, the Company has granted the
lenders a lien on all of the Company s accounts receivable,
inventories, equipment, land and buildings, and various other
assets. These agreements contain restrictions on capital
expenditures, additional debt or liens, investments, mergers and
acquisitions, and asset sales and prohibit payments such as
dividends or stock repurchases. These agreements also contain
various financial covenants, including financial performance
ratio requirements. The Company is in compliance with these
financial covenants. Fees associated with the March 26,
2004 and June 23, 2004 transactions, including underwriting
and legal fees, totaled approximately $1,801,000.

Historically, we have met our near term liquidity requirements
with cash flows from operations, funds available under the
Harris line of credit, and management of our working capital to
reflect current levels of operations. Management expects that
cash flows from operations, working capital management and
availability under the new bank revolving line of credit
described above will permit us to meet our liquidity
requirements through the term of the new credit facility.

Redeemable Preferred Stock  

Pursuant to a 1999 agreement to purchase certain assets of
Worthington Custom Plastics, Inc. ( Worthington ), the
Company issued 10,000 shares of its preferred stock,
without par value, to Worthington. The preferred stock was
mandatorily redeemable on April 15, 2004 at $1,000 per
share. The Company and Worthington entered into a stock
redemption agreement, dated December 23, 2003, that
provides for 30 monthly redemption payments of $50,000 each
over a three-year period (10 payments each year in 2004, 2005
and 2006) to fully redeem the preferred stock. Each $50,000
payment and redemption of 333 (or 334) shares reduces the
outstanding balance of the redeemable preferred stock by
$333,000 (or $334,000). Redemption payments made during the
years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005 resulted in the
recognition of a gain on redemption of redeemable preferred
stock  of $2,833,000 in each year which is reported in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations. If shares
are not redeemed in accordance with the provisions of this
agreement, the redemption price remains at $1,000 per share.

Capital Expenditures  

We incurred $6.5 million of capital expenditures during
2005, including approximately $3.3 million related to
expansion activities and approximately $3.2 million for the
normal update and replacement of manufacturing equipment.

We estimate that our capital expenditures in 2006 will total
approximately $6.8 million, of which $4.3 will be for
expansion activities and the remaining $2.5 million will be
for the normal update and replacement of manufacturing equipment.

Management expects that cash flow from operations, working
capital management and availability under the new bank revolving
line of credit described below will permit us to meet our
liquidity requirements through the term of the new credit
facility.

Quarterly Financial Information 

Selected quarterly financial information for the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004 is as follows:

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company has the following significant off-balance sheet
arrangements:

(i) The Company s operating lease obligation amounts
    are shown in the significant cash commitments table below. The
    Company enters into operating leases for larger units of
    manufacturing equipment related to many of its operations,
    including the laser cutting of sheet metal and the forming of
    sheet metal. Most parts fabricated by the Company are either
    laser cut, or formed, or both. The Company has operating leases
    that are scheduled to expire in 2006-2011; as these leases
    expire, it is likely that the Company will either extend those
    operating leases for the same units of manufacturing equipment
    or enter into new operating lease arrangements for replacement
    manufacturing units. 

(ii) The Company has provided bank letters of credit
    totaling approximately $2,086,000 to two creditors. One letter
    of credit is in support of operating lease payments; this letter
    of credit is for $388,000 and will be in effect through the
    entire term of certain leases that expire in December 2011,
    unless released earlier; the other letters of credit, in the
    total amount of $1,698,000 support future potential payments by
    the Company related to workers  compensation claims. These
    letters of credit will renew on an annual basis until the need
    for the letters of credit expires. Based on workers 
    compensation claims experience, the amount of these letters of
    credit are subject to adjustment on December 31, 2006. The
    outstanding letters of credit decrease, on a dollar-for-dollar
    basis, the amount of revolving line of credit available under
    the secured revolving credit facility. 

(iii) The Company entered into a swap agreement effective
    June 30, 2004 as described above in this Item 7 and
    also below in Item 7A. The swap agreement is for the
    purpose of limiting the effects of interest rate increases on
    approximately one-half of the Company s variable rate term
    debt. 

The Company has not given any guarantees for any unconsolidated
entities.

Significant Cash Commitments 

The Company has significant future cash commitments, primarily
scheduled debt and related interest payments and scheduled lease
payments. The commitments related to debt payments and lease
payments are fully described in Notes 7 and 8 of the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.

19

The following table summarizes the Company s contractual
obligations at December 31, 2005:

Under its bank credit facility, the Company had $2,086,000
standby letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2005
in connection with lease obligations and its workers
compensation program.

Pursuant to a 1999 agreement to purchase certain assets of
Worthington Custom Plastics, Inc. ( Worthington ), the
Company issued 10,000 shares of its preferred stock,
without par value, to Worthington. The preferred stock was
mandatorily redeemable on April 15, 2004 at $1,000 per
share. The Company and Worthington entered into a preferred
stock redemption agreement, dated December 23, 2003, that
provides for 30 monthly redemption payments of $50,000 each
over a three-year period (10 payments each year in 2004, 2005
and 2006) to fully redeem the preferred stock. Each $50,000
payment and redemption of 333 (or 334) shares reduces the
outstanding balance of the redeemable preferred stock by
$333,000 (or $334,000). As of March 24, 2006, the Company
has made 23 of the 30 scheduled redemption payments. If shares
are not redeemed under the provision of this agreement, the
redemption price remains at $1,000 per share. The
significant cash commitments table above assumes that payments
are made during 2006 and that the redeemable preferred stock is
retired for an additional $0.5 million.

Management expects that cash flow from operations, working
capital management and availability under its bank revolving
line of credit will permit the Company to meet its liquidity
requirements through the term of the credit facility.

Seasonality 

Our operating results vary significantly from quarter to quarter
due to, among other things, the purchasing schedules of our key
customers. Our sales and profits historically have been higher
in the first half of the calendar year due to our largest
customers  preparation in the first two quarters for
increased demand during the warmer months of the year.

Critical Accounting Policies 

In the preparation of the financial statements in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles,
management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying disclosures. Some of these estimates and
assumptions can be subjective and complex, and consequently,
actual results could differ from those estimates. Such estimates
and assumptions affect the Company s most critical
accounting policies: the allowance for doubtful accounts,
inventory valuation, accrued group health care costs, valuation
of warrants and the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

20

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   

The Company provides for an allowance for doubtful accounts
based on expected collectability of trade receivables. The
allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on the
Company s analysis of customer credit-worthiness,
historical loss experience and general economic conditions and
trends.

Inventories   

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The
Company evaluates its inventories for excess or slow moving
items based on sales order activity and expected market changes.
If circumstances indicate the cost of inventories exceed their
recoverable value, inventory is adjusted to its net realizable
value.

Group Health Care Costs   

Reserves for group health care costs are based upon an estimate
of benefit claims incurred but not reported, using historical
trends as a basis for the estimate.

Valuation of Warrants   

The valuation of the warrants issued in March 2004 is based upon
management s estimates of the ultimate number of warrants
to be put to the Company, considering the likelihood of a change
of control and an estimate of the Company s ability to
achieve certain earnings goals in 2006 and 2007. Other factors
included in the estimate are a future business enterprise
valuation factor based upon a multiple of estimated future
EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization), estimated future debt levels and a discount rate
used to reduce that future enterprise value to its present value.

Recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets   

In assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets,
management considers whether it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon generation of future taxable income during the
periods in which temporary differences become deductible.
Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax
liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning
strategies in making this assessment, and the deferred tax asset
valuation allowance is adjusted as appropriate.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 

In December 2004, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) Statement No. 123R (revised 2004), Share-Based
Payment, was issued. SFAS No. 123R addresses the
accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its
equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus
on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in
share-based payment transactions. This Statement is a revision
to Statement 123 and supersedes Accounting Principles Board
(APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and its related implementation guidance. This
Statement requires the fair value of all stock option awards
issued to employees to be recorded as compensation expense over
the related vesting period. This Statement also requires the
recognition of compensation expense of the remaining portion of
the fair value of any unvested stock option awards outstanding
at the date of adoption, as the options vest. The Company
estimates the adoption of Statement 123R will result in the
recognition of compensation costs for stock options of $27,000
in 2006. This statement will be adopted by the Company effective
January 1, 2006, as permitted by rules adopted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

In December 2004, SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs was
issued. SFAS No. 151 clarifies the accounting for
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling
costs, and wasted material (spoilage). Under this Statement,
such items will be recognized as current-period charges. In
addition, the Statement requires that allocation of fixed
production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the
normal capacity of the production facilities. This Statement is
effective for the Company s fiscal year beginning
January 1, 2006. The adoption of this Statement will not
have a significant impact on the Company s financial
statements.

21

In May 2005, SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and
Error Corrections was issued. SFAS No. 154 requires
retrospective application for voluntary changes in accounting
principle unless impractical to do so. Retrospective application
refers to the application of a different accounting principle to
previously issued financial statements as if that principle had
always been used. This Statement is effective for any accounting
changes and error corrections occurring after January 1,
2006.

Item 7A.  
     
      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
    Risk   

Interest Rate Risk 

The Company uses both variable-rate debt and fixed rate debt to
finance its operations. The variable-rate debt obligations
expose the Company to variability in interest payments due to
changes in interest rates. The variable-rate debt includes both
our revolving credit facility ($9.7 million at
December 31, 2005) and our term note payable
($16.1 million at December 31, 2005).

The Company entered into a swap agreement effective
June 30, 2004 related to $10,750,000 (the original notional
amount) of its term debt. The swap agreement expires
March 31, 2008. The swap agreement is for the purpose of
limiting the effects of interest rate increases on approximately
one-half of the Company s variable rate term debt. Under
this agreement, the Company pays a fixed rate of 3.72% on the
notional amount, which is payable periodically. In accordance
with the term loan agreement, the Company also pays an interest
margin which adjusts in steps based on achieved operating and
leverage metrics (3.50% since April 1, 2005). The notional
amount as of December 31, 2005 was $8,875,000.

The interest on the other portion of the term loan is currently
determined at the applicable margin described above plus a LIBOR
rate. The Company has elected to use 1, 2 and 3 month
LIBOR agreements in an effort to reduce the variability of
interest payments related to this portion of the term debt. At
December 31, 2005 the  all-in  rate including the
LIBOR rate and applicable margin related to this portion of the
term debt was approximately 7.97%.

The interest on the revolving credit facility is determined
primarily at the applicable margin plus LIBOR rates. The Company
has elected, at December 31, 2005, to use 1, 2 and
3 month LIBOR agreements in an effort to reduce the
variability of interest payments related to the revolving debt.
The LIBOR agreements totaled $11.0 million at
December 31, 2005; the corresponding average
 all-in  rates including the LIBOR rates and
applicable margin related to the revolving debt were
approximately 7.97%. The applicable margin plus the bank base
rate is paid on the revolving debt in excess of
$11.0 million; at December 31, 2005 this rate was 9.25
%.

If market rates of interest on our variable rate had been
100 basis points higher in 2005, our interest expense would
have been approximately $300,000 higher.

The interest rates on the senior subordinated debt and the
subordinated debt are fixed as described above.

Steel Commodity Risk 

We are also subject to commodity price risk with respect to
purchases of steel, which accounts for a significant portion of
our cost of sales. The primary raw materials that we use are
sheet steel, assembly parts and paint. Prices of these raw
materials fluctuate, although the price of our most significant
raw material, steel, increased dramatically during 2004 and
stabilized in 2005. The prices have increased modestly in 2006.
The steel supply tightened, due in part to the national economic
recovery, China s growing steel consumption, and reduced
domestic steel production capacity. We were able to negotiate
with our customers to have them absorb substantial amounts of
the increases in our raw material costs in 2004 and 2005.
Effective in 2005 and through early 2006, the price increases
have been incorporated into unit prices for those parts
manufactured for our customers. We also participate in the steel
purchase programs of certain major customers which lowers our
cost for steel. Generally, we purchase our raw materials from
multiple suppliers, and we believe that the prices we obtain are
competitive

reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Morton Industrial Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2004 and 2005, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in
our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

December 31, 2004 and 2005 

(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 

(1)  
     
     Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies  

(a)    
     
      Description of Business   

Morton Industrial Group, Inc. and subsidiaries is a contract
manufacturer and supplier of high-quality fabricated sheet metal
components and subassemblies for construction, agricultural and
industrial equipment manufacturers located primarily in the
Midwestern and Southeastern United States. Sales in 2005 were
approximately as follows: construction   64%,
agricultural   17% and industrial   19%. The
Company s raw materials are readily available, and the
Company is not dependent on a single supplier or only a few
suppliers.

(b)    
     
      Principles of Consolidation   

The consolidated financial statements include the financial
statements of Morton Industrial Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries
(together, the Company). All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

(c)    
     
      Use of Estimates in Preparing Financial Statements   

Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and
assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities,
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period to prepare these financial statements in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

(d)    
     
      Trade Accounts Receivable   

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is
the Company s best estimate of the amount of probable
credit losses in the Company s existing accounts
receivable. The Company determines the allowance based on
customer credit-worthiness, historical write-off experience and
general economic conditions and trends. Account balances are
charged off against the allowance after all means of collection
have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered
remote. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit
exposure related to its customers.

(e)    
     
      Inventories   

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined using the
 first-in,  first-out
(FIFO) method for all inventories.

(f)    
     
      Property, Plant, and Equipment   

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Equipment
held under capital leases is stated at the net present value of
the minimum lease payments at the beginning of the lease term.

Depreciation of plant and equipment is recognized over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets using
straight-line and accelerated methods. Equipment held under
capital leases is amortized using the straight-line method over
the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of
the asset.

(g)    
     
      Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets   

Goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of net
assets of businesses acquired. The Company adopted the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,  as of January 1, 2002. Goodwill and intangible
assets acquired in a purchase business

29

combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are
not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least
annually in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 142 also requires
that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized
over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated
residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with
SFAS No. 144,  Accounting for Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets. 

(h)    
     
      Income Taxes   

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss
and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the
carrying amount of deferred tax assets when it is more likely
than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not
be realized.

(i)    
     
      Stock Option Plan   

The Company has applied the intrinsic-value-based method of
accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
(APB) Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees,  and related interpretations including FASB
Interpretation No. 44,  Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, an interpretation of
APB Opinion No. 25,  to account for its fixed-plan stock
options. Under this method, compensation expense has been
recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price
of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price.
SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,  and SFAS No. 148,  Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation   Transition and Disclosure,
an amendment of SFAS No. 123,  established
accounting and disclosure requirements using a fair-value-based
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation
plans. As permitted by existing accounting standards, through
December 31, 2005, the Company has elected to continue to
apply the intrinsic-value-based method of accounting described
above, and has adopted only the disclosure requirements of
SFAS 123, as amended.

The per share weighted average fair value of stock options
granted during 2003 was $0.15 on the date of grant using the
Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted
average assumptions: expected dividend yield of 0%, risk-free
interest rate of 6%, volatility of 91%, and an expected life of
10 years. No stock options were granted during 2004 or 2005.

The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings if
the fair-value-based method had been applied to all outstanding
and unvested awards in each year.

See recently issued accounting standards in
section (o) of this footnote below.

30

(j)    
     
      Impairment of Long-lived Assets and Long-lived Assets to
    Be Disposed Of   

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, long-lived assets,
such as property, plant, and equipment, and purchased
intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated
undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated
future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately
presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the
carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no
longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal
group classified as held for sale are presented separately in
the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance
sheet.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, and is tested for
impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate
that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is
recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the
asset s fair value. This determination is made at the
reporting unit level and consists of two steps. First, the
Company determines the fair value of the reporting unit and
compares it to its carrying amount. Second, if the carrying
amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment
loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the
reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of
that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined
by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner
similar to a purchase price allocation, in accordance with
SFAS No. 141,  Business Combinations.  The
residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair
value of the reporting unit goodwill.

(k)    
     
      Revenue Recognition   

Revenue from sales is recognized when the goods are shipped and
the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss,
collection of the relevant receivable is probable and the sales
price is fixed or determinable.

Beginning in 2004, the Company incurred increased costs for the
purchase of raw materials as a result of dynamic changes in the
U.S. steel markets. The Company s supplier agreements
with key customers allow surcharges for the passthrough of the
additional raw material costs. The Company has recognized as net
sales, and also recognized an identical amount as cost of sales,
surcharge amounts of approximately $18,239 and $28,550 in 2004
and 2005, respectively. The Company has classified unbilled
surcharges in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as
 unbilled receivables.  The surcharges are generally
invoiced to the Company s customers within weeks following
the month end in which the related product is sold. As of
December 31, 2004 and 2005, the unpaid amount of billed
surcharges included in accounts receivable was $1,292 and
$1,033, respectively.

(l)    
     
      Interest Rate Swaps   

As required by one of its financing arrangements, the Company
has entered into an interest rate swap agreement to limit the
effect of increases in the interest rates on certain floating
rate debt. The difference between the floating rate on the
Company s debt and the rate on the swap agreement is
accrued as interest rates change and is recorded in interest
expense.

During 2004, the Company entered into a swap agreement, expiring
March 2008, with an initial aggregate notional amount of
$10,750. Under this agreement, the Company pays a fixed rate of
3.72% on the notional amount. In accordance with a term loan
agreement, the Company also pays an interest margin, which
adjusts in steps based on operating and leverage metrics
achieved by the Company (3.5% since April 1, 2005).

(m)    
     
      Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

The Company believes the recorded value of notes receivable,
notes payable and long-term debt approximates fair value because
their respective interest rates fluctuate with market rates or
approximate

31

current market rates. The recorded value of redeemable preferred
stock of $6,667 and $3,334 at December 31, 2004 and 2005,
respectively, exceeds its estimated fair value of $908 and $461,
respectively (see note 10).

Interest rate swaps are reported at fair value, which is the
estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to
terminate the agreements at the reporting date, taking into
account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness
of the counterparties.

(n)    
     
      Earnings Per Share   

Earnings per share is computed under the provisions of
SFAS No. 128,  Earnings Per Share.  Amounts
reported as earnings per share reflect the earnings available to
common shareholders for the period divided by the weighted
average number of Class A and Class B common shares
outstanding during the year. Basic per share information is
calculated by dividing earnings by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding. Diluted per share information is
calculated by also considering the impact of potential common
shares.

(o)    
     
      Recently Issued Accounting Standards   

In December 2004, SFAS No. 123R (revised 2004),
 Share-Based Payment  was issued. SFAS No. 123R
addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity
exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a
primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains
employee services in share-based payment transactions. This
Statement is a revision to Statement 123 and supersedes APB
Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,  and its related implementation guidance. This
Statement requires the fair value of all stock option awards
issued to employees to be recorded as compensation expense over
the related vesting period. This Statement also requires the
recognition of compensation expense of the remaining portion of
the fair value of any unvested stock option awards outstanding
at the date of adoption, as the options vest. The Company
estimates the adoption of Statement 123R will result in the
recognition of compensation costs for stock options of $27 in
2006. This Statement will be adopted by the Company effective
January 1, 2006, as permitted by rules adopted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

In December 2004, SFAS No. 151,  Inventory Costs
 was issued. SFAS No. 151 clarifies the accounting
for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling
costs, and wasted material (spoilage). Under this Statement,
such items will be recognized as current-period charges. In
addition, the Statement requires that allocation of fixed
production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the
normal capacity of the production facilities. This Statement is
effective for the Company s fiscal year occurring after
January 1, 2006.

In May 2005, SFAS No. 154,  Accounting Changes and
Error Corrections  was issued. SFAS No. 154
requires retrospective application for voluntary changes in
accounting principle unless impractical to do so. Retrospective
application refers to the application of a different accounting
principle to previously issued financial statements as if that
principle had always been used. This Statement is effective for
the Company for any accounting changes and error corrections
occurring after January 1, 2006.

(p)    
     
      Reclassifications   

The Company reclassified certain deferred financing costs as
other assets, instead of intangible assets, in the accompanying
December 31, 2004 balance sheet to conform with the 2005
presentation.

Also, amortization expense related to the deferred financing
costs has been reclassified as interest expense, rather than as
general and administrative costs for all periods presented in
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

(2)  
     
     Discontinued Operations  

The financial results from discontinued operations reflect the
results of Mid-Central Plastics, Inc. The Company sold the
assets of Mid-Central Plastics, Inc. on June 20, 2003. The
sales price, subsequent to a working capital adjustment, was
$6,100, with $4,800 received in cash at closing plus notes
receivable from the buyer totaling $1,296. The notes receivable
have all been collected as of December 31, 2005.

     Intangible Assets  

A summary of intangible assets is as follows:

For amortizable intangible assets, the total amortization
expense in 2003, 2004, and 2005 was $76, $76, and $79,
respectively. The estimated amortization expense for each of the
next five years ending December 31 is as follows:

     Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  

The Company uses variable-rate debt to finance its operations.
The debt obligations expose the Company to variability in
interest payments due to changes in interest rates. Management
believes it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of
its interest payments. To meet this objective, management has
entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage
fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk.
The swap changes the variable-rate cash flow exposure on the
debt obligations to fixed cash flows.

Under the terms of the interest rate swap, the Company receives
variable interest rate payments and makes fixed interest rate
payments, thereby creating the equivalent of fixed rate debt.

SFAS No. 133,  Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities,  as amended by SFAS No. 137
and No. 138, requires that all derivative instruments be
recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value. Gains or
losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives
are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and
whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. The Company reports
its interest rate swap agreements at fair value. The Company
recognized unrealized gains (losses) on interest rate swaps as a
component of interest expense of $(40) and $205 in 2004 and
2005, respectively, as they did not qualify for hedge accounting.

     Long-term Debt  

A summary of long-term debt follows:

The financing arrangements with Harris Trust and Savings Bank
(referred to as the former Harris Syndicate), were as follows as
of January 1, 2004:

In February 2002, the Company entered into a secured revolving
credit facility with the former Harris syndicate. The revolving
credit agreement permitted the Company to borrow up to a maximum
of $21,000. The agreement required payment of a quarterly
commitment fee of 0.50% per annum of the average daily
unused portion of the revolving credit facility. Interest was
due monthly and was based upon the bank prime rate plus 1.5%.
The revolving credit agreement was originally due on
July 1, 2003, and as amended, was extended to April 1,
2005.

In February 2002, the Company also entered into a secured term
loan arrangement with the former Harris syndicate for a term
loan of $32,965. The term loan under this financing arrangement
was amortized monthly with principal payments ranging from $235
to $500 and the balance of $24,930 due originally on
July 1, 2003, and as amended, was extended to April 1,
2005. Interest was due monthly and was based upon the bank prime
rate plus 1.5%. The agreement was secured by a first lien on all
of the Company s accounts receivable, inventories,
equipment and various other assets, other than the assets of
Morton Custom Plastics, LLC.

In addition, under this agreement, 238,584 warrants issued on
September 20, 2000 to purchase Class A Common Stock at
an exercise price of $0.01 per share remained outstanding.

On March 26, 2004, the Company entered into a Second
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks
led by Harris Trust and Savings Bank, As Agent (referred to as
the Harris syndicate), and also on March 26, 2004, entered
into a Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement with BMO Nesbitt
Burns Capital (U.S.) Inc., As Agent. These agreements were
effective on March 26, 2004, and provided financing to
replace the revolving credit facility and term note payable due
to a former Harris syndicate. In connection with this
transaction, the 238,584 warrants to purchase Class A
Common Stock were surrendered by the holders; and, as described
below, new warrants were issued on March 26, 2004.

35

On June 23, 2004, the Company entered into the First
Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
and also on June 23, 2004, entered into an Amended and
Restated Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement with BMO Nesbitt
Burns Capital (U.S.) Inc., As Agent. The effect of the
June 23, 2004 amendments was to increase the amount due to
BMO Nesbitt Burns Capital (U.S.) Inc., As Agent, by $2,000,000,
reduce the balance outstanding under the four-year secured term
loan described below by $1,000,000 and reduce the balance
outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility
described below by $1,000,000.

Under the terms of the new agreements and subsequent amendments,
effective as of June 23, 2004, and as of December 31,
2005, the Company has:

1) A four-year secured term loan in the original principal
    amount of $21,000,000 with variable rate interest; principal
    payments were due in quarterly installments of $500,000 which
    began June 30, 2004 and continued through March 31,
    2005, and due in quarterly installments of $750,000 beginning
    June 30, 2005 through December 31, 2007 with the
    balance of $6,427,000 due on March 31, 2008. Mandatory
    principal payments of $633,000 related to the 2003 sale of the
    assets of Mid-Central Plastics, Inc. have been made. The term
    loan requires excess cash flow repayments of $1,734,000 and
    $1,958,000 to be paid on March 31, 2006 and May 31,
    2006, respectively. The excess cash flow payments are equal to
    75% of the amount by which earnings before interest, income
    taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) exceed
    interest expense paid in cash, income taxes paid in cash,
    principal payments on all indebtedness and capital expenditures.
    No estimate has been made for any excess cash flow payment that
    could become due on March 31, 2007. 

2) A secured revolving credit facility with a limit of
    $18,000,000, with variable rate interest. At December 31,
    2005, the Company has a revolving credit balance of $9,700,000
    and availability of $7,042,000 under this facility. The balance
    is due March 31, 2008. The amount available under the
    revolving credit facility is limited to 85% of eligible accounts
    receivable and 60% of eligible inventories. The facility
    requires a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum on the unused
    portion of the facility. 

At the Company s option, for both the secured term loan and
    the secured revolving credit facility, interest will be at
    either a bank base rate plus applicable margin, or an adjusted
    LIBOR plus a LIBOR applicable margin. At inception, the bank
    rate plus applicable margin was 6.75% and the adjusted LIBOR
    plus a LIBOR applicable margin was 5.35%. At December 31,
    2004 those rates were 7.75% and 6.78%, respectively, and at
    December 31, 2005, those rates were 9.25% and 7.97%,
    respectively. 

The Company entered into a swap agreement effective
    June 30, 2004 related to $10,750,000 (the original notional
    amount) of its term debt. The swap agreement is for the purpose
    of limiting the effects of interest rate increases on
    approximately one-half of the Company s variable rate term
    debt. Under this agreement, the Company pays a fixed rate of
    3.72% on the notional amount, which is payable quarterly. In
    accordance with the term loan agreement, the Company also pays
    an interest margin which adjusts in steps based on achieved
    operating and leverage metrics (4.00% during the first three
    months of 2005, and then reducing to 3.50%). The notional amount
    as of December 31, 2005 was $8,875,000. The swap agreement
    expires March 31, 2008. 

3) Senior secured subordinated notes totaling $12,000,000
    with cash interest of 12% and
     payment-in -kind
    interest of 2% or 4% with no principal amortization, and the
    balances due March 26, 2009. This debt is subordinated to
    the secured term loan and the revolving credit facility with
    respect to both payment and lien priority. The balance as of
    December 31, 2005 is $12,771,000 (reported as $11,988,000,
    reflecting a discount of $783,000). 

Related to the senior secured subordinated note, on
    March 26, 2004, the Company issued 545,467 warrants to
    purchase shares of its Class A Common Stock for
    $0.02 per share; these warrants expire March 26, 2014.
    The warrant holder may exercise the warrants at any time. The
    warrants may be put to the Company, at their then fair market
    value, at the earlier of: a) five years from the date of
    issue; b) a change of control; c) a default on the
    senior secured subordinated loan; or d) a prepayment of 75%
    or more of the original principal balance of the senior secured
    subordinated loan. 

36

The Company estimated the fair value of the warrants at the date
of issue, and as of December 31, 2004 and 2005, to be
$1,500,000, $1,791,000 and $2,872,000, respectively. These
estimates are reported as warrants payable in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets for 2004 and 2005. The fair value
allocated to the warrants at the date of issue resulted in the
recognition of an equal amount of debt discount, which is being
amortized using the effective yield method over 5 years,
the term of the related senior secured subordinated note. The
Company reports the warrants at fair value and records changes
in the fair value as interest expense. The valuation of the
warrants issued in March 2004 is based upon management s
estimate of the ultimate number of warrants to be put to the
Company, considering the likelihood of a change of control and
an estimate of the Company s ability to achieve certain
earnings goals in 2006 and 2007. Other factors included in the
estimate are a future business enterprise valuation factor based
upon a multiple of estimated future EBITDA (earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), estimated
future debt levels and a discount rate used to reduce that
future enterprise value to its present value.

The stock purchase warrant includes provisions that will reduce
the number of warrants that can be put to the Company below
545,467 if a) a change of control occurs prior to
5 years from the date of issue and the Company achieves
specified net equity levels; or b) if a change of control
has not occurred prior to 5 years from the date of issue
and the Company achieves specified EBITDA (earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) levels. The
number of warrants could be reduced to any one of several
levels, but no lower than 290,278. For the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2005, the Company achieved the EBITDA
level that would reduce the maximum number of warrants
outstanding. The maximum number of warrants that may be put or
exercised has been reduced to 415,128 as of December 31,
2005.

The Company has provided bank letters of credit totaling
approximately $2,086 to two creditors. One letter of credit is
in support of operating lease payments; this letter of credit is
for $388 and will be in effect through the entire term of
certain leases that expire in December 2011, unless released
earlier; the other letters of credit, in the aggregate amount of
$1,698 support future potential payments by the Company related
to workers  compensation claims. These letters of credit
will renew on an annual basis until the need for the letters of
credit expires. Based on workers  compensation claims
experience, the amount of these letters of credit is subject to
adjustment on December 31, 2006. The outstanding letters of
credit decrease, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the amount of
revolving line of credit available under the secured revolving
credit facility.

In connection with these loans, the Company has granted the
lenders a lien on all of the Company s accounts receivable,
inventories, equipment, land and buildings, and various other
assets. These agreements contain restrictions on capital
expenditures, additional debt or liens, investments, mergers and
acquisitions, and asset sales and prohibit payments such as
dividends or stock repurchases. These agreements also contain
various financial covenants, including financial performance
ratio requirements. The Company is in compliance with these
financial covenants. Fees associated with the March 26,
2004 and June 23, 2004 transactions, including underwriting
and legal fees, totaled approximately $1,801.

The aggregate amounts of contractual long-term debt maturities
and principal payments (based upon the amended credit facilities
described above) for each of the five years subsequent to
December 31, 2005 are as follows:

37

The Company is obligated under various capital leases for
certain machinery. At December 31, the gross amount of
equipment and related amortization recorded under capital leases
was as follows:

Assets under capital leases are included in property, plant, and
equipment and amortization of assets held under capital leases
is included in depreciation expense.

The present value of future minimum capital lease payments at
December 31, 2005 was as follows:

The Company also has operating leases for several of its plants,
certain warehouse space, and manufacturing and computer
equipment. Rental expense for operating leases was $6,317,
$6,516 and $7,380 in 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively.

Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating
leases (with initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one
year) as of December 31, 2005 are:

     Income Taxes  

Total income tax expense (benefit) for the periods presented was
allocated as follows:

38

Income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations consists
of the following:

Total income tax expense (benefit) attributable to earnings from
continuing operations differed from the amounts computed by
applying the U.S. Federal corporate income tax rate of 34%
for all periods to earnings before income taxes as a result of
the following:

39

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to
significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax
liabilities at December 31, 2004 and 2005, are presented
below:

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets,
management considers whether it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during
the periods in which those temporary differences become
deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of
deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and
tax planning strategies in making this assessment. In order to
fully realize the net deferred tax asset, the Company will need
to generate future taxable income of approximately $34,000 prior
to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards in
2007   2024. In addition, the Company has alternative
minimum tax credit carryforwards at approximately $1,017, which
are available to reduce future Federal regular income taxes, if
any, over an indefinite period. Management believes it is more
likely than not the Company will realize the benefits of these
deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowance
at December 31, 2005, based upon anticipated profitability
over the period of years that the temporary differences are
expected to become tax deductions. The amount of the deferred
tax asset considered realizable, however, could be reduced in
the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the
carryforward period are reduced.

At December 31, 2005, the Company has net operating loss
carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes of approximately
$56,000 which are available to offset future federal taxable
income. These net operating losses expire in various years from
2007 through 2024.

(10)  
     
     Redeemable Preferred Stock  

Pursuant to a 1999 agreement to purchase certain assets of
Worthington Custom Plastics, Inc. (Worthington), the Company
issued 10,000 shares of its preferred stock, without par
value, to Worthington. The preferred stock was mandatorily
redeemable on April 15, 2004 at $1,000 per share. The
preferred stock was valued at $4,250 at the time of the
acquisition and the discount was accreted over a five-year
period using the effective yield method. See also note 18
related to litigation regarding Worthington.

The Company and Worthington entered into a stock redemption
agreement, dated December 23, 2003, that provides for
30 monthly redemption payments of $50 each over a
three-year period (10 payments each year in 2004, 2005, and
2006) to fully redeem the preferred stock. Each payment redeems
333 (or 334) shares of the 10,000 shares outstanding and
results in a gain on redemption of $283. Redemption payments
made during 2004 and 2005 resulted in a gain on redemption of
redeemable preferred stock of $2,833 in each year,

40

which is reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations. If shares are not redeemed in accordance with the
provisions of this agreement, the redemption price remains at
$1,000 per share. As part of this agreement, all litigation
between the Company and Worthington was settled and dismissed.

(11)  
     
     Stockholders  Equity  

The Company s capital stock consists of Class A and
Class B common stock. The Class A and Class B
shares have the same rights and preferences, except that the
Class B shares guarantee the holders certain special voting
rights. The holders of the Class B common stock are ensured
that the total votes available to be cast by the holders, when
combined with Class A common stock held, will be at least
24% of the votes available to be cast by all holders of common
stock.

The board of directors is also authorized to issue one or more
series of preferred stock, with the number of shares, dividend
rate, voting rights, redemption features, and other rights to be
determined by the board of directors.

In 1998, the Company adopted a stock option plan (the Plan)
pursuant to which the Company s board of directors may
grant stock options to officers and key employees. The Plan
authorizes grants of options to purchase up to
1,166,896 shares of authorized but unissued Class A
common stock. Stock options are granted with an exercise price
equal to the stock s fair market value at the date of
grant. All stock options under the Plan have ten-year terms and
vest and become fully exercisable after three years from the
date of grant. At both December 31, 2004 and 2005, there
were 327,561 additional shares available for grant under the
Plan.

Stock option activity during the periods indicated is as follows:

     Concentration of Sales  

Sales to customers in excess of 10% of total net sales for 2003,
2004, and 2005 are as follows:

Trade accounts receivable with these customers totaled $5,965
and $8,836 at December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively.

(14)  
     
     Employee Participation Plan  

The Company s Employee Participation Plan allows
substantially all employees to defer up to 15% of their income
through payroll deduction of pre-tax contributions under
section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company
matches 100% of the first 2%, and 25% of the next 4%, of pre-tax
income contributed by each employee. Employees may also make
contributions of after-tax income. Additionally, the Company may
make discretionary contributions to the plan for the benefit of
participating employees. The expense charged to operations
related to defined contribution plans was $230, $299, and $517
in 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively.

42

The following reflects the reconciliation of the numerators and
denominators of the basic and diluted earnings (loss) available
to common shareholders per share computations:

Subsequent to the previously reported sale of Mid-Central
Plastics, Inc., the Company has only one remaining
segment   the contract metal fabrication segment.

(17)  
     
     Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)  

Selected quarterly financial information for 2005 and 2004 is as
follows:

43

On May 1, 2000, Worthington Industries, Inc. (Worthington)
filed suit (in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Ohio, Eastern Division (the Court)) against the
Company and Morton Custom Plastics, LLC (MCP, LLC) related to
MCP, LLC s 1999 acquisition of the nonautomotive plastics
business from Worthington. In connection with the stock
redemption agreement described in note 10 above, all
litigation between the Company and Worthington was released. An
order of dismissal of the Worthington lawsuit against the
Company was entered in the Court on January 20, 2004.

The Company is also involved in various other claims and legal
actions, including environmental issues, in the normal course of
business. Management does not believe the resolution of any such
matters will have a material adverse effect on the
Company s financial condition or results of operations.

(19)  
     
     Subsequent Event   Entry into a Material Definitive
    Agreement that Will Take the Company Private  

On March 22, 2006, the Company entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger ( Merger Agreement ) under which
MMC Precision Merger Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of MMC
Precision Holdings Corp. ( Parent ), will merge with
and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving
corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

This transaction will take the Company private.

The shareholders of Parent will include a private equity fund
that is an affiliate of Brazos Private Equity Partners, LLC,
which will hold a majority of the shares of Parent, and five
current directors or officers of the Company or its
subsidiaries. In the merger, each outstanding share of common
stock of the Company, other than shares to be contributed to
Parent by the current officers or directors concurrently with
the closing of the merger, will be converted to the right to
receive $10.00 cash per common share.

The merger is subject to several conditions, including approval
by the Company s stockholders, voting together as one
class; approval by Company stockholders who are not interested
stockholders with respect to the merger transaction; and the
receipt of financing and regulatory approval. The Company s
board of directors and a special committee, appointed by the
board of directors to represent the non-interested shareholders
in the negotiation of the merger, have approved the merger and
Merger Agreement.

Item 9A.  
     
      Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.  The
Company s principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule  13a-15(c) 
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), are
effective based on their evaluation of these controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
Form  10-K. 

The Company s management, including its principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures or its
internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A
control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of
a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in
all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur
because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can
be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
collusion of two or more people or by management override of the
control.

Changes in internal controls.  There have been no
significant changes in the Company s internal controls over
financial reporting that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2005
that may have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company s internal control over
financial reporting.

EXHIBIT 10.60

        SECOND AMENDMENT TO SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT

     This Second Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
(herein, the "Amendment") is made as of February 8, 2005, by and among Morton
Industrial Group, Inc., a Georgia corporation (the "Borrower"), the Lenders
party to the Credit Agreement hereinafter identified and defined, and Harris
Trust and Savings Bank, as Agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, the
"Agent").

RECITALS

     A. The Lenders currently extend credit to the Borrower on the terms and
conditions set forth in that certain Second Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement dated as of March 26, 2004, as amended, by and among the Borrower, the
Guarantors, the Lenders and the Agent (the "Credit Agreement"). All capitalized
terms used herein without definition shall have the same meanings herein as such
terms have in the Credit Agreement.

     B. The Borrower has requested that the Lenders amend certain provisions of
the Borrowing Base and certain financial covenants set forth in the Credit
Agreement, and the Lenders are willing to do so on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

     NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

SECTION 1.  AMENDMENTS.

     Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in, and
effective from and after the date specifically set forth in, Section 2 below,
the Credit Agreement shall be and hereby is amended as follows:

     1.1. The definition of "Borrowing Base" set forth in Section 5.1 of the
Credit Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as
follows:

               "Borrowing Base" means, as of any time it is to be determined,
          the sum of:

               (a) 85% of the then net book value of Eligible Accounts (computed
          using the method of receivables valuation applied by the Borrower in
          accordance with GAAP which reflects such value as the net book value
          of its receivables, except that net book value for such purposes shall
          not reflect any reserve for accounts more than ninety days past due
          that have already been excluded from gross accounts in computing such
          Eligible Accounts) less such other reserves for uncollectibility,
          location of account debtor, contras and other matters as the Agent or
          Required Lenders in good

faith shall from time to time reasonably deem appropriate to adjust
          such net book value; plus

               (b) the lesser of (x) $13,000,000 and (y) 60% of the value
          (computed at its cost using the method of inventory valuation applied
          by the Borrower in accordance with GAAP which reflects such cost on
          the Borrower's books as its net book value, but in any event after
          reducing such value as so computed by the aggregate amount of all
          reserves for obsolescence, slow-moving items, shrinkage and all such
          other matters as the Agent or Required Lenders in good faith shall
          from time to time reasonably deem appropriate to adjust such net book
          value) of Eligible Inventory, provided that, in no event shall the
          amount computed pursuant to this clause (b) exceed 60% of the
          Borrowing Base; minus

               (c) a general reserve in the amount of $500,000;

          provided that (A) the Borrowing Base shall be computed only as against
          and on so much of the Collateral as is included on the certificates to
          be furnished from time to time by the Borrower pursuant to Section
          8.5(f) hereof and, if required by the Agent pursuant to any of the
          terms hereof or any Collateral Document, as verified by such other
          evidence required to be furnished to the Agent pursuant hereto or
          pursuant to any such Collateral Document, and (B) the Agent shall have
          the right to adjust the advance rates against Eligible Receivables and
          Eligible Inventory based solely on the commercially reasonable
          exercise of its credit judgment based on the results of any field
          audit of any Collateral which reasonably supports any such adjustment
          and the Agent shall notify the Borrower of any such adjustment to the
          advance rates promptly following such adjustment.

          Notwithstanding any other provision of this definition of "Borrowing
          Base" to the contrary: (i) the amount of Eligible Accounts otherwise
          included in the Borrowing Base shall be reduced, dollar for dollar, by
          a reserve equal to the greater of (a) the amount (if any) by which (x)
          the aggregate amount of accounts payable owing by the Borrower and its
          Subsidiaries to Deere and Caterpillar together and their respective
          Affiliates for inventory and supplies purchased (the
          "Deere/Caterpillar Payables") at any time exceeds (y) $8,000,000 or
          (b) the sum of (A) the amount (if any) by which (x) the aggregate
          amount of accounts payable owing by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
          to Deere and its Affiliates for inventory and supplies purchased (the
          "Deere Payables") at any time exceeds (y) $5,000,000 and (B) the
          amount (if any) by which (x) the aggregate amount of accounts payable
          owing by the

-2-

Borrower and its Subsidiaries to Caterpillar and its Affiliates for
          inventory and supplies purchased (the "Caterpillar Payables") at any
          time exceeds (y) $4,000,000; (ii) no reserve will be imposed in
          computing the Borrowing Base as of any time solely in respect of the
          Deere/Caterpillar Payables, Deere Payables or Caterpillar Payables to
          the extent the same do not exceed such respective limits; and (iii)
          the Agent and the Required Lenders shall have the right to impose
          reserves for other matters arising in connection with receivables
          owing by Deere and Caterpillar and to otherwise impose reserves in
          accordance with the Credit Agreement.

     1.2. Section 8.10 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by (i) deleting
the amount "$4,800,000" for fiscal year 2004 and replacing it with the amount
"$5,400,000," and (ii) deleting the amount "$5,200,000" for fiscal year 2005 and

     1.3. Section 8.14(b) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by deleting
the amount "$7,800,000" for the fiscal year 2005 and replacing it with the
amount "$8,000,000."

     1.4. Exhibit H to the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and restated to
read in its entirety as set forth on the revised Exhibit H attached hereto.

(b) Section 8.10 of the Purchase Agreement is hereby amended by deleting
the amount "$5,280,000" for Fiscal Year 2004 and replacing it with the amount

        (b) the Agent shall have received copies (executed or certified, as may
be appropriate) of all legal documents or proceedings taken in connection with

counsel may reasonably request;

        (c) legal matters incident to the execution and delivery of this

        (b) upon the effectiveness of this Amendment, the Company hereby
reaffirms that all covenants, representations and warranties made in the
Purchase Agreement and the other Operative Documents, to the extent that the
same are not amended hereby, are true and complete in all material respects as
if remade as of the effective date of this Amendment (except to the extent
stated to relate to a specific earlier date, in which case such representations,
warranties and covenants are true and correct as of such earlier date); and

        (c) no Event of Default exists under the Purchase Agreement.

     5. Reference to the Effect on the Purchase Agreement.

        (a) Upon the effectiveness of this Amendment, on and after the date of

"hereunder,"

2

"hereof," "herein" or words of like import shall mean and be a reference to the
Agreement as amended hereby (except that for all purposes, the "date hereof" and
words of similar import shall mean June 23, 2004).

        (b) Except as specifically modified above, the Purchase Agreement and
all other documents, instruments and agreements executed and/or delivered in
connection therewith shall remain in full force and effect, and are hereby
ratified and confirmed.

        (c) The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Amendment shall
not operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of the Agent or the
Purchasers, nor constitute a waiver of any provision of the Purchase Agreement
or any other documents, instruments or agreements executed and/or delivered in
connection therewith (except as expressly set forth herein). Nothing herein
shall constitute a waiver by the Agent or the Purchasers of any existing or
hereafter arising Event of Default nor shall the Agent's and the Purchasers'
execution and delivery of this Amendment establish a course of dealing among the
Agent, the Purchasers, the Company or any other obligor or in any other way
obligate the Agent or any of the Purchasers to provide hereafter any further
consents, waivers or modifications with respect to the Purchase Agreement.

     6. Collateral Documents. The Company may have herewith and heretofore
executed and delivered to the Agent, on behalf of the Purchasers, certain
Operative Documents, and the Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that,
notwithstanding the execution and delivery of this Amendment, the Operative
Documents remain in full force and effect and the rights and remedies of the
Agent and the Purchasers thereunder, the obligations of the Company thereunder
and the liens and security interests created and provided for thereunder remain
in full force and effect and shall not be affected, impaired or discharged
hereby. Nothing herein contained shall in any manner affect or impair the
priority of the liens and security interests created and provided for in the
Operative Documents as to the indebtedness which would be secured thereby prior
to giving effect to this Amendment.

     7. Expenses. The Company agrees to pay on demand all costs and expenses of
or incurred by the Agent and the Purchasers in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Amendment and the other instruments
and documents executed and delivered in connection with the transactions
described herein (including the filing or recording thereof), including the fees
and expenses of counsel for the Agent and the Purchasers.

     8. Governing Law. This Amendment shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws (as opposed to the conflict of law provisions)
of the State of Illinois.

     9. Headings. Section headings in this Amendment are included herein for
convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Amendment
for any other purpose.

     10. Counterparts; Telefacsimile. This Amendment may be executed by one or
more of the parties to the Amendment on any number of separate counterparts, and
all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and
the same instrument. Delivery

3

of an executed counterpart of this Amendment by telefacsimile shall be equally
as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Amendment.
Any party delivering an executed counterpart of this Amendment by telefacsimile
shall also deliver a manually executed counterpart of this Amendment, but the
failure to deliver a manually executed counterpart shall not affect the
validity, enforceability, and binding effect of this Amendment.

     11. No Strict Construction. The parties hereto have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Amendment and the Purchase Agreement. In
the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Amendment and the Purchase Agreement as hereby amended shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provisions of this Amendment or the Purchase Agreement.

     12. Effectuation. The amendments to the Purchase Agreement contemplated by
this Amendment shall be deemed effective immediately upon the full execution of
this Amendment and without any further action required by the parties hereto.
There are no conditions precedent or subsequent to the effectiveness of this
Amendment.

     13. Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. One or more counterparts
of this Amendment may be delivered by facsimile, with the intention that
delivery by such means shall have the same effect as delivery of an original
counterpart thereof.

 FOURTH AMENDMENT TO AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT

Exhibit 10.63

FOURTH AMENDMENT TO SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT

         This Fourth Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
(herein, the "Amendment") is made as of December 23, 2005, by and among Morton
Industrial Group, Inc., a Georgia corporation (the "Borrower"), the Lenders
party to the Credit Agreement hereinafter identified and defined, and Harris
N.A., successor by merger to Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as Agent for the
Lenders (in such capacity, the "Agent").

                                    RECITALS

          A. The Lenders currently extend credit to the Borrower on the terms
and conditions set forth in that certain Second Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement dated as of March 26, 2004, as amended, by and among the Borrower, the
Guarantors, the Lenders and the Agent (the "Credit Agreement"). All capitalized
terms used herein without definition shall have the same meanings herein as such
terms have in the Credit Agreement.

         B. The Borrower has requested that the Lenders modify the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2005 and the Capital
Expenditures limitation for the fiscal year 2005, and the Lenders are willing to
do so on the terms and conditions set forth in this Amendment.

         NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

SECTION 1. AMENDMENTS.

         Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in
Section 2 below, the Credit Agreement shall be and hereby is amended as follows:

         1.1. Section 5.1 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by amending
and restating the definition of "Excess Cash Flow" set forth therein to read in
its entirety as follows:

                  "Excess Cash Flow" means, with respect to any period, the
         amount (if any) by which (a) EBITDA for such period exceeds (b) the sum
         of (i) Interest Expense payable in cash during such period, plus (ii)
         federal, state and local income taxes payable in cash during such
         period, plus (iii) the aggregate amount of payments required to be made
         by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries during such period in respect of
         all principal on all Indebtedness (whether at maturity, as a result of
         mandatory sinking fund redemption, mandatory prepayment, acceleration
         or otherwise, but excluding payments made under the Revolving Credit
         and excluding mandatory prepayments of the Term Loans required to be
         paid in respect of Excess Cash Flow under Section 3.3(a) hereof) and
         all payments of Indebtedness of the type described in clause (viii) of
         the definition of "Indebtedness" herein, plus (iv) the aggregate amount
         of Capital Expenditures made by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
         during such period to the extent

permitted by this Agreement and not financed with proceeds of
         Indebtedness, provided that, for the fiscal year of the Borrower ending
         December 31, 2005 only, the aggregate amount of Capital Expenditures
         made by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries during such fiscal year shall
         be deemed by the parties hereto to be $5,500,000 for the purposes of
         calculating the amount of Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year,
         notwithstanding the actual amount of Capital Expenditures made by such
         parties during such period.

         1.2. Section 8.9 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and restated
to read in its entirety as follows:

                   Section 8.9. Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. The Borrower will
         not, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Borrower ending
         on the dates set forth below, permit the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio to
         be less than:

1.3. Section 8.10 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by deleting
the amount "$5,500,000" for fiscal year 2005 and replacing it with the amount
"$7,000,000."

SECTION 2. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT.

         The effectiveness of this Amendment is subject to the satisfaction of
all of the following conditions precedent:

                  2.1. The Borrower, the Agent, the Required Lenders and the
         Guarantors shall have executed and delivered this Amendment.

         this Amendment shall be satisfactory to the Agent and its counsel.

                  2.3. The Agent shall have received a certified copy of an
         amendment to the Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement increasing the
         capital expenditures limitation covenant therein to an amount not less
         than $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2005 and which shall otherwise be in
         form and substance acceptable to the Agent.

                  2.4. The Borrower shall have paid to the Agent, for the
         benefit of the Lenders, an amendment fee in the amount of $2500 per
         Lender.

                                      -2-

SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS.

         In order to induce the Lenders to execute and deliver this Amendment,
the Borrower hereby represents to the Lenders that as of the date hereof, and
after giving effect to this Amendment, (a) the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 6 of the Credit Agreement are and shall be and remain true
and correct in all material respects (except that for purposes of this paragraph
the representations contained in Section 6.5 shall be deemed to refer to the
most recent financial statements of the Borrower delivered to the Lenders) and
(b) the Borrower is in full compliance with all of the terms and conditions of
the Credit Agreement after giving effect to this Amendment and no Default or
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Credit Agreement or

executed and delivered to the Agent and the Lenders certain of the Collateral
Documents. The Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding the
execution and delivery of this Amendment, the Collateral Documents remain in
full force and effect and the rights and remedies of the Agent and the Lenders
thereunder, the obligations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries thereunder, and
the liens and security interests created and provided for thereunder remain in
full force and effect and shall not be affected, impaired, or discharged hereby.
Nothing herein contained shall in any manner affect or impair the priority of
the liens and security interests created and provided for by the Collateral
Documents as to the indebtedness which would be secured thereby prior to giving
effect to this Amendment.

         4.2. Except as specifically amended herein or waived hereby, the Credit
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its
original terms. Reference to this specific Amendment need not be made in the
Credit Agreement, the Notes, or any other instrument or document executed in
connection therewith, or in any certificate, letter or communication issued or
made pursuant to or with respect to the Credit Agreement, any reference in any
of such items to the Credit Agreement being sufficient to refer to the Credit
Agreement as amended hereby.

         4.3. The Borrower agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by the Agent and the Lenders in connection with the
preparation, execution and delivery of this Amendment and the documents and
transactions contemplated hereby, including the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel for the Agent with respect to the foregoing.

         4.4. This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts, and
by the different parties on different counterpart signature pages, all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Any of the parties
hereto may execute this Amendment by signing any such counterpart and each of
such counterparts shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original. This
Amendment shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Illinois.

5.3   The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Amendment
      shall not operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of Agent or
      the Purchasers, nor constitute a waiver of any provision of the Purchase
      Agreement or any other documents, instruments or agreements executed
      and/or delivered in connection therewith (except as expressly set forth
      herein). Nothing herein shall constitute a waiver by Agent or the
      Purchasers of any existing or hereafter arising Event of Default nor shall
      Agent's and the Purchasers' execution and delivery of this Amendment
      establish a course of dealing among Agent, the Purchasers, the Company or
      any other obligor or in any other way obligate Agent or any of the
      Purchasers to provide hereafter any further consents, waivers or
      modifications with respect to the Purchase Agreement.

            5.4   The Company may have herewith and heretofore executed and
      delivered to Agent, on behalf of the Purchasers, certain Operative
      Documents, and the Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that,
      notwithstanding the execution and delivery of this Amendment, the
      Operative Documents remain in full force and effect and the rights and
      remedies of Agent and the Purchasers thereunder, the obligations of the
      Company thereunder and the liens and security interests created and
      provided for thereunder remain in full force and effect and shall not be
      affected, impaired or discharged hereby. Nothing herein contained shall in
      any manner affect or impair the priority of the liens and security
      interests created and provided for in the Operative Documents as to the
      indebtedness which would be secured thereby prior to giving effect to this
      Amendment.

            5.5   The Company agrees to pay on demand all costs and expenses of
      or incurred by Agent and the Purchasers in connection with the
      negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Amendment and the
      other instruments and documents executed and delivered in connection with
      the transactions described herein (including the filing or recording
      thereof), including the fees and expenses of counsel for Agent and the
      Purchasers.

            5.6   This Amendment shall be governed by and construed in
      accordance with the internal laws (as opposed to the conflict of law
      provisions) of the State of Illinois.

            5.7   Section headings in this Amendment are included herein for
      convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this
      Amendment for any other purpose.

            5.8   This Amendment may be executed by one or more of the parties
      to the Amendment on any number of separate counterparts, and all of said
      counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same
      instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Amendment by
      telefacsimile shall be equally as effective as delivery of a manually
      executed counterpart of this Amendment. Any party delivering an executed
      counterpart of this Amendment by telefacsimile shall also deliver a
      manually executed counterpart of this Amendment, but the failure to
      deliver a manually executed counterpart shall not affect the validity,
      enforceability, and binding effect of this Amendment.

            5.9   The parties hereto have participated jointly in the
      negotiation and drafting of this Amendment and the Purchase Agreement. In
      the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
      this Amendment and the Purchase Agreement as hereby

                                      -3-

amended shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto,
      and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring
      any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Amendment
      or the Purchase Agreement.

            5.10  The amendments to the Purchase Agreement contemplated by this
      Amendment shall be deemed effective immediately upon the full execution of
      this Amendment and without any further action required by the parties
      hereto. There are no conditions precedent or subsequent to the
      effectiveness of this Amendment.

            5.11  This Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts,
      each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall
      constitute one and the same instrument. One or more counterparts of this
      Amendment may be delivered by facsimile, with the intention that delivery
      by such means shall have the same effect as delivery of an original
      counterpart thereof.

                            [SIGNATURE PAGES FOLLOW]

LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

[PICTURE]

STATE OF THE COMPANY

2005 was a very important year in the history of Morton Industrial Group, Inc.
and its operating company, Morton Metalcraft Co. The general economy was strong
with the Construction, Agricultural, and Commercial capital goods industries we
serve quite robust. Our prestigious customers, in particular Caterpillar Inc.
and Deere & Co., achieved record shipping and profitability levels. Their
strength throughout the year provided a stable environment from which Morton
Metalcraft Co. could continue its quest to achieve operating excellence using 6
Sigma methodologies. The result was very good performance for our company as
well.

KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF 2005

During 2004, we worked hard to add sufficient capacity to meet the dramatic
increase in demand experienced by our customers. Throughout 2005, we were able
to focus on creating efficiencies utilizing the new manpower, machines and
materials we had put in place to support the higher levels of customer shipping
requirements.

While we were expanding our capacity for our customers, we were also achieving
lower cost targets. While we were achieving improved safety results for our
employees, we were also increasing their incentive compensation participation.
While we were lowering our overall debt to financial institutions, we were
investing significantly in new assets throughout our factories. From nearly all
perspectives, Morton Metalcraft Co. had a very progressive year in 2005!

OUTLOOK FOR 2006

Most industry experts suggest that the Construction and Commercial capital goods
segments will remain strong in 2006, while the Agricultural segment appears to
be softening modestly. Overall, our customer demand appears that it will be
higher again this year. And, we are very excited that we have been able to
introduce JLG Industries, Inc. as the newest member of our prestigious customer
base during the early part of this year.

During 2006 we intend to successfully meet our customers' delivery and cost
objectives and to improve our quality performance even further. We intend to
successfully meet our employees' safety and incentive compensation objectives
and to improve the working environments of each of our factories even further.

IN CONCLUSION

To provide an appropriate capital structure to support our growth, we have
announced our intention to take Morton Industrial Group, Inc. private in a
transaction led by Brazos Private Equity Partners, LLC. The recapitalization
(details included in our enclosed 10-K) will result in our shareholders
receiving a significant premium over the historic trading values for our stock.
Shareholders are encouraged to read all relevant documents that we have filed
and will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding this
recapitalization. As many of you have been shareholders for years, please let me
thank you for your loyal support. We appreciate the ownership investment you
have made in our Company and extend our best wishes to each of you in your
future endeavors.

Finally, and most importantly, I'd like to express my appreciation to each of
our dedicated employees. Together, you are doing your individual jobs better
than many others who serve our marketplace. As a result, Morton Metalcraft Co.
has become a company that stands above the performance of most of our
competitors. By remaining focused on continuing to improve each aspect of our
company's performance, we will again find that we are significantly adding value
to our prestigious customers, the industries they serve and to each one of our
lives as employees.

May 2006 be another good year for everyone involved with Morton Metalcraft Co.
