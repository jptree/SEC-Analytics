NATIONAL BEVERAGE CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

JANUARY 28, 2006 
(UNAUDITED) 

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

National Beverage Corp. develops, manufactures, markets and distributes a complete portfolio of
quality non-alcoholic beverage products throughout the United States. Incorporated in Delaware in
1985, National Beverage Corp. is a holding company for various operating subsidiaries. When used
in this report, the terms  we,   us,   our,   Company  and  National Beverage  mean National
Beverage Corp. and its subsidiaries.

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) and rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information. The
financial statements do not include all information and notes required by GAAP for complete
financial statements. In our opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments)
considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Results for the interim periods
presented are not necessarily indicative of results which might be expected for the entire fiscal
year.

These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended April 30, 2005.

2. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 

As provided by SFAS 123, we use the intrinsic value method to account for stock based compensation
awarded to employees, which generally does not recognize any compensation expense with respect to
such awards unless the exercise price of options granted is less than the market price on the date
of grant. SFAS 123R, which will be effective for the Company in fiscal 2007, requires the use of
the fair value method for all share-based payments. Had the fair value method been used, net
income and basic and diluted earnings per share for the three-month and nine-month periods ended
January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005 would have been reduced on a pro forma basis by less than
$200,000 and $.01 per share, respectively.

During the nine months ended January 28, 2006, options for 121,050 shares were granted at a
weighted average exercise price of $7.39 and options for 418,000 shares were exercised at a
weighted average exercise price of $2.16. At January 28, 2006, options to purchase 683,108 shares
at a weighted average exercise price of $3.84 were outstanding and stock-based awards to purchase
2,839,252 shares of common stock were available for grant.

3. INVENTORIES 

Inventories are stated at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or market. Inventories at January
28, 2006 are comprised of finished goods of $19,413,000 and raw materials of $13,781,000.
Inventories at April 30, 2005 are comprised of finished goods of $17,411,000 and raw materials of
$12,327,000.

Table of Contents   

4. PROPERTY 

Property consists of the following:

Depreciation expense was $2,630,000 and $7,743,000 for the three-month and nine-month periods ended
January 28, 2006, respectively, and $2,323,000 and $7,097,000 for the three-month and nine-month
periods ended January 29, 2005, respectively.

5. DEBT AND LEASE COMMITMENTS 

A subsidiary maintains unsecured revolving credit facilities aggregating $45 million (the  Credit
Facilities ) with banks. The Credit Facilities expire through May 1, 2007 and bear interest at   1  / 2 %
below the banks  reference rate or   3  / 4 % above LIBOR, at the subsidiary s election. At January 28,
2006, there was no debt outstanding under the Credit Facilities and approximately $42 million was
available for future borrowings.

The Credit Facilities require the subsidiary to maintain certain financial ratios and contain other
restrictions, none of which are expected to have a material impact on our operations or financial
position. Significant financial ratios and restrictions include: fixed charge coverage; net worth
ratio; and limitations on incurrence of debt. At January 28, 2006, we were in compliance with all
loan covenants and approximately $25 million of retained earnings were restricted from
distribution.

6. COMMON STOCK 

In January 1998, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 800,000 shares of National
Beverage common stock. There were no shares purchased during the nine months ended January 28,
2006. Aggregate shares purchased since January 1998 were 502,060 and are classified as treasury
stock.

On January 27, 2006, the Company paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share, aggregating $38
million, to shareholders of record on January 5, 2006, including holders of deferred shares.

7. FRUCTOSE SETTLEMENT 

In June 2005, we received a partial payment of $7.7 million from the settlement of our claim in a
class action lawsuit known as  In re: High Fructose Corn Syrup Antitrust Litigation Master File No.
95-1477 in the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois . The lawsuit
related to purchases of high fructose corn syrup made by the Company and others. The settlement
amount was allocated to each class action recipient based on the proportion of its purchases to
total purchases by all class action recipients. The amount received, less offsets and expenses of
$.5 million, was recorded as a reduction in cost of sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. In
November 2005, the Company received $1.2 million, representing the final payment due

7

Table of Contents   

under the settlement. Such amount was recorded in the third quarter ended January 28, 2006 as a
reduction in cost of sales.

8. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

Management has reviewed the current and proposed changes in accounting standards and does not
expect any of these changes to have a material impact on the Company.

9. RECLASSIFICATIONS 

Reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation,
including reclassifications to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine
months ended January 29, 2005 to reflect the gross purchases and sales of auction rate securities
as investing activities rather than as a component of cash and equivalents.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

OVERVIEW 

National Beverage Corp. develops, manufactures, markets and distributes a complete portfolio of
quality beverage products throughout the United States. Incorporated in Delaware in 1985, National
Beverage Corp. is a holding company for various operating subsidiaries. When used in this report,
the terms  we,   us,   our,   Company  and  National Beverage  mean National Beverage Corp. and
its subsidiaries.

Our lines of multi-flavored soft drinks, including those of our flagship brands, Shasta    and
Faygo    ,  emphasize distinctive flavor variety. In addition, we offer an assortment of premium
beverages geared to the health-conscious consumer, including Everfresh    ,  Home Juice    ,  and Mr. Pure     
100% juice and juice-based products; and LaCroix    ,  Mt. Shasta , Crystal Bay    and ClearFruit     
flavored and spring water products. We also produce specialty products, including Rip It , an
energy drink geared toward young consumers, Ohana    fruit-flavored drinks and St. Nick s    holiday
soft drinks. Substantially all of our brands are produced in 14 manufacturing facilities that are
strategically located in major metropolitan markets throughout the continental United States. To a
lesser extent, we develop and produce soft drinks for retail grocery chains, warehouse clubs,
mass-merchandisers and wholesalers ( allied brands ) as well as soft drinks for other beverage
companies.

Our strategy emphasizes the growth of our products by offering a branded beverage portfolio of
proprietary flavors; by supporting the franchise value of regional brands and expanding those
brands with new packaging and broader demographic emphasis; by developing and acquiring innovative
products tailored toward healthy lifestyles; and by appealing to the  quality-price  expectations
of the family consumer. We believe that the  regional share dynamics  of our brands perpetuate
consumer loyalty within local regional markets, resulting in more retailer sponsored promotional
activities.

Over the last several years, we have focused on increasing penetration of our brands in the
convenience channel through Company-owned and independent distributors. The convenience channel is
composed of convenience stores, gas stations and other smaller  up-and-down-the-street  accounts.
Because of the higher retail prices and margins that typically prevail, we have undertaken specific
measures to expand distribution in this channel. These include development of products specifically
targeted to this market, such as ClearFruit, Everfresh, Mr. Pure, Crystal Bay, and Rip It.
Additionally, we have created proprietary and specialized packaging for these products with
distinctive graphics. Recently, the Company developed and introduced powdered beverage products
under the Rip It and PowerBlast  names for distribution in this channel. We intend to continue
our focus on enhancing growth in the convenience channel through both specialized packaging and
innovative product development.

Beverage industry sales are seasonal with the highest volume typically realized during the summer
months. Additionally, our operating results are subject to numerous factors, including
fluctuations in the costs of raw materials, changes in consumer preference for beverage products
and competitive pricing in the marketplace.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Three Months Ended January 28, 2006 (third quarter of fiscal 2006) compared to  
 Three Months Ended January 29, 2005 (third quarter of fiscal 2005) 

Net sales for the three months ended January 28, 2006 increased 5.9% to $109.6 million compared to
the third quarter of fiscal 2005. Led by higher sales of Rip It energy drinks, the Company reported
a 3.2% improvement in pricing and a 4.6% increase in branded volume, partially offset by a slight
decline in lower margin allied volume.

Gross profit approximated 31.9% of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 and 31.4% of net
sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The improvement in gross margin was due to the effects
of the pricing improvements mentioned above and $1.2 million received from a fructose settlement
partially offset by higher energy and packaging costs. Excluding the fructose settlement, cost of
goods sold per unit increased 4.2% over the comparable period last year. See Note 7 of Notes to
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $31.6 million or 28.9% of net sales for the third
quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to $31.8 million or 30.7% of net sales for last year. The decline
as a percent of sales was due to the effect of higher sales on fixed expenses.

Other income includes interest income of $484,000 (fiscal 2006) and $198,000 (fiscal 2005). The
increase in interest income is due to higher invested balances and investment yields. Also, other
income in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 includes a loss of $67,000 on the disposal of property.

The Company s effective rate for income taxes, based upon estimated annual income tax rates,
approximated 37.4% of income before taxes for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 and 37.9% for the
comparable period in fiscal 2005. The difference between the effective rate and the federal
statutory rate of 35% was primarily due to the effects of state income taxes, nondeductible
expenses and nontaxable interest income.

Net income was $2,297,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to $586,000 for the third
quarter of fiscal 2005.

Nine Months Ended January 28, 2006 (first nine months of fiscal 2006) compared to  
 Nine Months Ended January 29, 2005 (first nine months of fiscal 2005) 

Net sales for the nine months ended January 28, 2006 increased 2.8% to $383.5 million compared to
the first nine months of fiscal 2005, excluding $1.8 million received last year from a customer
relative to a recovery of pricing and promotional allowances for product shipped in a previous
period. The increase was due to higher sales of Rip It energy drinks and pricing improvements
partially offset by an 11.7% decline in allied case volume. Excluding the $1.8 million noted above,
net sales per unit increased 3.8% during the first nine months of fiscal 2006. Also, volume was
negatively impacted by the effects of three hurricanes in fiscal 2006.

Gross profit approximated 32.7% of net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2006 and 32.1% of
net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2005. This improvement was due to net proceeds of
$8.4 million received from a fructose settlement partially offset by the effects of higher cost of

10

Table of Contents   

goods sold, lower allied case volume, and the $1.8 million noted above. Excluding the fructose
settlement, cost of goods sold per unit increased approximately 5.7%, primarily due to higher raw
material costs. See Note 7 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $99.8 million or 26.0% of net sales for the first
nine months of fiscal 2006 compared to $98.9 million or 26.4% of net sales for last year. The
decline as a percent of sales was due to the effect of higher sales on fixed expenses.

Other income includes interest income of $1.2 million (fiscal 2006) and $406,000 (fiscal 2005). The
increase in interest income is due to higher invested balances and investment yields. Also, other
income in the first nine months of fiscal 2006 includes a loss of $354,000 on the disposal of
property.

The Company s effective rate for income taxes, based upon estimated annual income tax rates,
approximated 37.4% of income before taxes for the first nine months of fiscal 2006 and 37.9% for
the comparable period in fiscal 2005. The difference between the effective rate and the federal
statutory rate of 35% was primarily due to the effects of state income taxes, nondeductible
expenses and nontaxable interest income.

Net income was $16,554,000 for the first nine months of fiscal 2006 compared to $13,562,000 for the
first nine months of fiscal 2005.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Capital Resources 

Our current sources of capital are cash flow from operations and borrowings under existing credit
facilities. We maintain unsecured revolving credit facilities aggregating $45 million of which
approximately $42 million was available for future borrowings at January 28, 2006. We believe that
existing capital resources are sufficient to meet our capital requirements and those of the parent
company for the foreseeable future.

Cash Flows 

During the first nine months of fiscal 2006, $24.5 million was provided from operating activities,
which was offset by $4.7 million used for investing activities and $37.1 million used for financing
activities. Cash provided by operating activities increased $798,000 due to an increase in earnings
partially offset by an increase in working capital requirements. Cash used in investing activities
decreased $19.4 million due to a decline in property additions and net marketable securities
purchased. Cash used in financing activities increased $37.2 million due to a $38 million cash
dividend paid in January 2006.

Financial Position 

During the first nine months of fiscal 2006, our working capital decreased $19.4 million to $62.5
million primarily due to the cash dividend paid in January 2006. Trade receivables declined $7.9
million due to an improvement in days sales outstanding and lower sales related to seasonality.
Inventory increased $3.5 million due to the effects of new products introduced and cost increases.
Prepaid and other assets decreased $2.0 million due to declines in income tax refund receivables
and certain prepaid expenses. At January 28, 2006, the current ratio was 2.2 to 1 compared to 2.4
to 1 at April 30, 2005.

11

Table of Contents   

Liquidity 

We continually evaluate capital projects designed to expand capacity, enhance packaging
capabilities and improve efficiencies at our manufacturing facilities. In the latter part of
fiscal 2004, we initiated several capital expenditure programs to upgrade our manufacturing
facilities, which resulted in increased capital expenditures in fiscal 2005 and, to a lesser
extent, in fiscal 2006. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2006 are expected to be less than fiscal
2005 amounts.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this  Form 10-Q ) constitute
 forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other
factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be
materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by
such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
general economic and business conditions; pricing of competitive products; success in acquiring
other beverage businesses; success of new product and flavor introductions; fluctuations in the
costs of raw materials; our ability to increase prices; continued retailer support for our
products; changes in consumer preferences; success of implementing business strategies; changes in
business strategy or development plans; government regulations; regional weather conditions; and
other factors referenced in this Form 10-Q. We disclaim an obligation to update any such factors
or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained
herein to reflect future events or developments.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

There are no material changes to the disclosures made on this matter in the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2005.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

As of January 28, 2006, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was done under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Principal Financial
Officer ( PFO ). Based on that evaluation, our CEO and PFO concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures as of January 28, 2006 were effective in timely alerting them to material
information required to be included in this report. There has been no change in our internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has

operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this

4. 
       
     The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and
maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e)) for the registrant and have: 

a. 
       
     Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls

relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by
others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being
prepared; 

b. 
       
     Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and

controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such
evaluation; and 

c. 
       
     Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial

affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control
over financial reporting; and 

5. 
       
     The registrant s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the
audit committee of registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent
function): 

a. 
       
     All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
and 

b. 
       
     Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who
have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
