1.  

Basis
                of Presentation   

On
      June
      29, 2005, the Company changed its name from Provident Bancorp, Inc. to Provident
      New York Bancorp in order to differentiate itself from the numerous bank holding
      companies with similar names. 

The
      consolidated financial statements and other financial information presented
      in
      this document as of December 31, 2005 include the accounts of Provident New
      York
      Bancorp, a Delaware corporation (the  Company ), Provident Bank (the  Bank ) and
      Hardenburgh Abstract Company of Orange County, Inc. ( Hardenburgh ), and each
      subsidiary of Provident Bank: Provest Services Corp., (an inactive subsidiary),
      Provest Services Corp. I, Provest Services Corp. II, Provident REIT, Inc.,
      WSB
      Funding, Inc., Warsave Development Corp., Provident Municipal Bank and WSB
      Financial Services, Inc. (an inactive subsidiary). Collectively, these entities
      are referred to herein as the  Company . Provident New York Bancorp is a
      publicly-held company and the parent of the Bank. Provest Services Corp. I
      holds
      a limited partnership interest in a low-income housing partnership that provides
      certain favorable tax consequences. Warsave holds an investment in a rental
      property that generates rental income. Hardenburgh is a title insurance agency
      that generates title insurance fees and commissions. Provest Services Corp.
      II
      has engaged a third-party provider to sell annuities and life insurance to
      the
      customers of the Bank. Through December 31, 2005, the activities of these
      wholly-owned subsidiaries have had a minor impact on the Company s consolidated
      financial condition and results of operations. Provident REIT, Inc. and WSB
      Funding, Inc. hold a portion of the Company s real estate loans and are real
      estate investment trusts for federal income tax purposes. Provident Municipal
      Bank ( PMB ) is a limited purpose New York State-chartered commercial bank and
      is authorized to accept deposits from municipalities in the Bank s New York
      business area. 

The
      Company s off-balance sheet activities are limited to loan origination
      commitments, lines of credit and letters of credit extended to customers or,
      in
      the case of letters of credit, on behalf of customers in the ordinary course
      of
      its lending activities. The Company does not engage in off-balance sheet
      financing transactions or other activities involving the use of special-purpose
      or variable interest entities. 

The
      consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management without
      audit, but, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments, consisting
      of
      normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s
      financial position and results of operations as of the dates and for the periods
      presented. Although certain information and footnote disclosures have been
      condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
      and
      Exchange Commission applicable to quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, the Company
      believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented
      clear. The results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2005
      are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for other interim
      periods or the entire fiscal year ending September 30, 2006. The unaudited
      consolidated financial statements presented herein should be read in conjunction
      with the annual audited financial statements included in the Company s Form 10-K
      for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. 

The
      consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
      accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
      preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to
      make
      estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
      liabilities, income and expense. Actual results could differ significantly
      from
      these estimates. A material estimate that is particularly susceptible to
      near-term change is the allowance for loan losses (see Note 5), which is a
      critical accounting policy.

      TO
      CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

      (Unaudited) 

      (Dollars
      in thousands, except per share amounts) 
 
        Stock-Based
      Compensation   

The
      Company applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 123R,
   Accounting
      for Stock-Based Compensation,    and
      related interpretations in accounting for its stock option plan. Statement
      of
      Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 123R, issued in December
      of 2004, established accounting and disclosure requirements using a
      fair-value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation
      plans, and required adoption for all publicly owned companies for fiscal periods
      ending after July 15, 2005. As of October 1, 2005, the Company has begun to
      expense these grants as required by SFAS No. 123R. Stock-based employee
      compensation cost pertaining to stock options is reflected in net income, as
      all
      unvested options granted under the Company s stock option plans had a value
      based on the fair value calculations using the Black-Scholes option pricing
      model, even though the exercise prices were equal to the market value of the
      underlying common stock on the date of the grant. Prior to October 1, 2005,
      the
      Company applied the requirements of APB Opinion No. 25 ( APB 25 ),  Accounting
      for Stock Issued to Employees,  and related interpretations, in accounting for
      its stock-based plans. Under APB 25, no compensation expense was recognized
      for
      the Company s stock-based plans regarding employee stock-options. The Company
      did, however, recognize expense for its plans which were compensatory per APB
      25, and had grant-date intrinsic value (which occurs if the exercise price
      is
      less than the market value on the day of the grant) such as restricted stock
      grants (RRPs).  

The
      Company s stock-based compensation plans allow for accelerated vesting when an
      employee reaches retirement age and ceases continuous service. Under SFAS No.
      123R, grants issued subsequent to adoption of SFAS 123R which are subject to
      such an accelerated vesting upon the recipient s attainment of retirement age,
      are expensed over the shorter of the time to retirement age or the vesting
      schedule in accordance with the grant. Thus the vesting period can be far less
      than the plan s five-year vesting period depending on the age of the grantee. As
      of December 31, 2005, the following grants valued under SFAS No. 123R
      were subject to this accelerated vesting: 418,860 restriced stock shares and
      535,280 stock options. 

The
      Company elected the modified prospective transition method for adopting SFAS
      No.
      123R. Under this method, the provisions of SFAS No. 123R apply to all awards
      granted or modified after the date of adoption. During the quarter ended
      December 31, 2005, the Company issued 25,000 new stock-based awards and
      recognized total non-cash stock-based compensation cost of $365,000 primarily
      for shares related to transition awards, along with the fair-value of these
      new
      grants. As of December 31, 2005, the total remaining unrecognized compensation
      cost related to non-vested stock options was $3.8 million. In addition to the
      recording requirements, the Company has disclosure requirements under SFAS
      No.
      123 and No. 123R. The following table illustrates the effect on net income
      if
      the fair-value-based method per SFAS No. 123R had been applied to all
      outstanding awards for the quarter ended December 31, 2004.

        (Dollars
        in thousands, except per share amounts) 

While
      the
      fair-value-based method prescribed by Statement No. 123R is similar to the
      fair-value-based method disclosed under the provisions of Statement No. 123
      in
      most respects, there are some differences. (Generally, the amounts charged
      to
      income will be somewhat consistent with the amounts disclosed for pro-forma
      purposes in the past). The following table describes currently unvested grants
      which were used in the fair-value calculations for the first quarter of fiscal
      2006 stock-based compensation expense calculations, and previously vested
      exercisable grants that were excluded from the fair-value calculation:

As
      a
      portion of these shares were anti-dilutive as of December 31, 2005, they were
      not included in common stock equivalents for earnings per share purposes.

2.                      Acquisitions   

The
      Company has been active in acquisitions over the past several years. All
      acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
      Accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded by the
      Company at their fair values at the acquisition date.  

On
      October 1, 2004 the Company completed its acquisition of Warwick Community
      Bancorp, Inc. ( WSB  or  Warwick ), located in Warwick, New York. WSB was the
      holding company for The Warwick Savings Bank, headquartered in Warwick, New
      York, The Towne Center Bank, headquartered in Lodi, New Jersey and Hardenburgh
      Abstract Company of Orange County, Inc., headquartered in Goshen, New York.

On
      January 14, 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of E.N.B. Holding
      Company, Inc. ( ENB ), located in Ellenville, New York. ENB was the holding
      company for Ellenville National Bank. 

On
      April
      23, 2002, the Company completed its acquisition of The National Bank of Florida
      ( NBF ), located in Florida, New York.  

Below
      is
      a summary of the financial transactions, including the most recent branch
      purchase on May 19, 2005 of an HSBC Bank USA, National Association ( HSBC )
      branch office in South Fallsburg New York, which has been consolidated with
      the
      Bank s existing branch in South Fallsburg. 

Goodwill
      is not amortized to expense, but is reviewed for impairment at least annually,
      with impairment losses charged to expense, if and when they occur. The core
      deposit intangible asset is recognized apart from goodwill and amortized to
      expense over its estimated useful life and evaluated, at least annually, for
      impairment. 

3.              Critical
      Accounting Policies   

The
      accounting and reporting policies of the Company are prepared in accordance
      with
      accounting principles generally accepted within the United States of America
      and
      conform to general practices within the banking industry. Accounting policies
      considered critical to the Company s financial results include the allowance for
      loan losses, accounting for goodwill and the recognition of interest income.
      The
      methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is considered by
      management to be a critical accounting policy due to  the  high 
degree of  judgment  involved, the subjectivity of the assumptions
      utilized and the potential for changes  in the economic  environment
      that could  result  in changes to the

        (Dollars
        in thousands, except per share amounts) 

amount
      of
      the allowance for loan losses considered necessary. Accounting for goodwill
      is
      considered to be a critical policy because goodwill must be tested for
      impairment at least annually using a  two-step  approach that involves the
      identification of reporting units and the estimation of fair values. The
      estimation of fair values involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity
      in
      the assumptions utilized. Interest income on loans, securities and other
      interest-earning assets is accrued monthly unless management considers the
      collection of interest to be doubtful. A loan is placed on nonaccrual status
      when management has determined that the borrower may be unable to meet
      contractual principal or interest obligations, or when payments are 90 days
      or
      more past due, unless well secured and in the process of collection. Accrual
      of
      interest ceases and, in general, uncollected past due interest is reversed
      and
      charged against current interest income if such unpaid interest relates to
      the
      current year. Prior years  non-accrual interest is charged to the allowance for
      loan losses. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans, including impaired
      loans, are not recognized as income unless warranted based on the borrower s
      financial condition and payment record. Application of assumptions different
      than those used by management could result in material changes in the Company s
      financial position or results of operations. Footnote 2 (Summary of Significant
      Accounting Policies) of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending
      September 30, 2005 provides detail with regard to the Company s accounting for
      the allowance for loan losses. With the exception of the adoption of SFAS 123R
      (accounting for stock-based compensation), on October 1, 2005, and the resulting
      expensing of stock options, there have been no significant changes in the
      application of accounting policies since September 30, 2005.

Major
      classifications of loans, excluding loans held for sale, are summarized
      below: 

5.               Allowance
      for Loan Losses and Non-Performing Assets   

The
      allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for losses charged
      to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management
      believes that the collection of principal is unlikely. Recoveries of loans
      previously charged-off are credited to the allowance when realized. The
      allowance for loan losses is the amount that management has determined to be
      necessary to absorb probable loan losses inherent in the existing portfolio.
      Management s evaluations, which are subject to periodic review by the Company s
      regulators, are made using a consistently-applied methodology that takes into
      consideration such factors as the Company s past loan loss experience, changes
      in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality,
      review of specific problem loans and collateral values, and current economic
      conditions that may affect the borrowers  ability to pay. Changes in the
      allowance for loan losses may be necessary in the future based on changes in
      economic and real estate market conditions, new information obtained regarding
      known problem loans, regulatory examinations, the identification of additional
      problem loans, and other factors.

At
      December 31, 2005 and September 30, 2005, the accumulated unrealized net loss
      on
      securities available for sale (net of tax of $6,964 and $5,565 respectively)
      that was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component
      of stockholders  equity, was ($10,183) and $(8,184) respectively. Gross realized
      gains were $0 and $49 respectively, and there were no gross realized losses,
      for
      the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.  

Securities
      with a carrying amount of $401,283 and $297,359 were pledged as collateral
      for
      municipal deposits, borrowings and other purposes at December 31, 2005 and
      September 30, 2005, respectively. 

The
      following table summarizes, for all securities in an unrealized loss position
      at
      December 31, 2005, the aggregate fair value and gross unrealized loss by length
      of time those securities have continuously been in an unrealized loss
      position: 

Substantially
      all of the unrealized losses at December 31, 2005 relate to investment grade
      securities and are attributable to changes in market interest rates subsequent
      to purchase. There were no securities with unrealized losses that were
      individually significant dollar amounts at December 31, 2005. A total of 263
      securities were in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12
      months, and 222 securities for 12 months or longer. For fixed maturities, there
      are no securities past due or securities for which the Company currently
      believes it is not probable that it will collect all amounts due according
      to
      the contractual terms of the investment. Because the Company has the ability
      and
      intent to hold securities with unrealized losses until a market price recovery
      (which, for securities with fixed maturities, may be until maturity) the Company
      did not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at
      December 31, 2005, except for an investment in Freddie Mac perpetual preferred
      stock, previously determined to have other than temporary impairment loss of
      $93
      on a recorded basis of $905.

As
        a
        member of the FHLB of New York, the Bank may borrow in the form of term and
        overnight borrowings up to the amount of eligible mortgages that have been
        pledged as collateral under a blanket security agreement. As of December
        31,
        2005 and September 30, 2005, the Bank had pledged mortgages with collateral
        value totaling $354,170 and $301,154 respectively. Based on outstanding
        borrowings under the line totaling $286,700 and $269,529 as of December 31,
        2005
        and September 30, 2005, the Bank had unused borrowing capacity under the
        FHLB of
        New York Line of Credit of $67,470 and  $31,625 respectively. The Bank may
        borrow additional amounts by pledging securities not required to be pledged

      and Other Post Retirement Plans   

Net
      post
      retirement cost, which is recorded within salaries and employee benefits expense
      in the consolidated statements of income, is comprised of the
      following: 

The
      contribution expected to be made to all plans in fiscal 2006 is $1,600. As
      of
      December 31, 2005, the Company has contributed $87. As part of the acquisition
      of WSB, the Company assumed the WSB Pension Plan, a defined benefit plan. The
      WSB plan was frozen on April 30, 2002. As part of the acquisition of ENB, the
      Company assumed the ENB Pension Plan, a defined benefit plan. The ENB plan
      was
      frozen in connection with the merger of ENB into the Company. The Company is
      currently evaluating its alternatives regarding combination, termination or
      continuation of the frozen plans.  

11.            Guarantor s
      Obligations Under Guarantees   

Nearly
      all letters of credit issued by or on behalf of the Company are standby letters
      of credit. Standby letters of credit are commitments issued by the Company
      on
      behalf of its customer/obligor in favor of a beneficiary that specify an amount
      the Company can be called upon to pay upon the beneficiary s compliance with the
      terms of the letter of credit. These commitments are primarily issued in favor
      of local municipalities to support the obligor s completion of real estate
      development projects. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit
      is
      essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to
      customers. 

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, the Company had $17.8 million in outstanding letters of
      credit, of which $6.1 million were secured by cash collateral.

Management s
                Discussion and Analysis of Financial  

                 Condition
                and Results of Operations  

Forward-Looking
      Statements   

The
      Company has made, and may continue to make, various forward-looking statements
      with respect to earnings, credit quality and other financial and business
      matters for 2006 and, in certain instances, subsequent periods. The Company
      cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to numerous
      assumptions, risks and uncertainties, and that statements for subsequent periods
      are subject to greater uncertainty because of the increased likelihood of
      changes in underlying factors and assumptions. Actual results could differ
      materially from forward-looking statements. 

In
      addition to those factors previously disclosed by the Company and those factors
      identified elsewhere herein, the following factors could cause actual results
      to
      differ materially from such forward-looking statements; pricing pressures on
      loan and deposit products; changes in local and national economic conditions;
      the extent and timing of actions of the Company s regulators; customer deposit
      disintermediation; changes in customers  acceptance of the Company s products
      and services; general actions of competitors, other normal business risks such
      as credit losses, litigation and increases in the levels of non-performing
      assets. The Company s forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on
      which such statements are made. The Company assumes no duty to update
      forward-looking statements to reflect new, changing or unanticipated events
      or
      circumstances. 

The
      Company s significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the
      consolidated financial statements included in its September 30, 2005 Annual
      Report on Form 10-K. An accounting policy considered particularly critical
      to
      the Company s financial results is the allowance for loan losses. The
      methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses
      and non-performing loans is considered a critical accounting policy by
      management due to the high degree of judgment involved, the subjectivity of
      the
      assumptions utilized, and the potential for changes in the economic environment
      that could result in changes in the necessary allowance. 

As
      discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item
      1
      of this quarterly report, the Company completed its acquisition of WSB on
      October 1, 2004. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and,
      accordingly, amounts attributable to Warwick have been included in the Company s
      consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. 

Comparison
      of Financial Condition at December 31, 2005 and September 30,
      2005   

Total
      assets    
      as of
      December 31, 2005 were $2.6 billion, an increase of $32.5 million, or 1.3%,
      from
      September 30, 2005. The increase from September 30, 2005 was primarily due
      to an
      increase in loans, and to a lesser extent, securities. Loans increased $25.3
      million, and securities increased $4.7 million. Core deposit intangibles
      decreased by $837,000 in net amortization, from September 30, 2005. 

Net
      loans    
      as of
      December 31, 2005 were $1.4 billion, an increase of $25.3 million, or 1.9%,
      over
      net loan balances of $1.3 billion at September 30, 2005. Commercial loans
      increased by $15.2 million, or 2.1%, over balances at September 30, 2005.
      Consumer loans increased by $5.5 million, or 2.8%, during the three-month period
      ended December 31, 2005, while residential loans increased by
      $4.4. 

22 

million,
      or 1.0%. Total loan originations, excluding loans originated for sale, were
      $155.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2005. However, repayments
      and sales of loans were $129.1   million
      for the three months ended December 31, 2005. Loan quality continues to be
      strong, although non-performing loans grew substantially this quarter. This
      was
      primarily due to a $2.2 million loan that matured during the quarter ended
      September 30, 2005, and was greater than 90 days overdue at December 31, 2005
      as
      to its principal payment, but was completely paid off in January 2006. At $5.1
      million, non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans was 0.36%, as
      compared to 0.12% at September 30, 2005 and 0.26% at December 31,
      2004. 

Total
      securities    
      increased by $4.6 million, or 0.5%, to $898.5 million at December 31, 2005
      from
      $893.9 million at September 30, 2005. Investments were made primarily in
      government and federal agency securities and municipal securities, which
      increased by $11.7 million, or 3.3%. This increase was partially offset by
      payments received on our mortgage-backed securities and mark-to- market
      adjustments on available for sale securities due to changes in market interest
      rates. 

Deposits    
      as of
      December 31, 2005 were $1.7 billion, down $51.1 million, or 3.0%, from September
      30, 2005. As of December 31, 2005 retail and commercial transaction accounts
      were 30.7% of deposits compared to 31.9% at September 30, 2005. The large
      decrease in non-transaction deposits was largely due to disintermediation caused
      by the higher yielding interest bearing accounts, shifting the lower interest
      bearing accounts to either our higher-yielding deposit products or to other
      institutions offering higher yields. As of January 2006, we have begun to offer
      certain new products that offer higher, market-sensitive interest rates and
      others that offer transaction account incentives.  

Despite
      the decrease in aggregate deposit period-end balances, average transaction
      account balances were $520.3 million and $523.5 million for the quarter ended
      December 31, 2005 and September 30, 2005, respectively, compared to period-end
       snap shot  balances, which declined from $551.0 million at September 30, 2005
      to $514.7 million at December 31, 2005.  Snap shot  balances are subject to more
      volatile changes than the period averages. Management believes that average
      balances on deposits, especially transaction accounts, reflect a more accurate
      picture of deposits than period end balances. 

Borrowings    
      increased by $91.6 million from September 2005, or 20.7%, to $533.8 million.
      Much of the increase is related to the borrowings used to fund the increase
      in
      loans, mitigate changes in deposit balances and for repurchases of shares of
      Company common stock. 

Stockholders 
      equity    
      decreased by $2.6 million to $392.6 million at December 31, 2005 compared to
      $395.2 million at September 30, 2005. The decrease is largely attributable
      to a
      $5.0 million increase in treasury shares, and an increase of $2.0 million in
      other comprehensive loss for unrealized losses on available for sale securities
      and dividends of $2.0 million. This decrease was offset by $5.2 million in
      current earnings for the three-month period, a $595,000 increase in additional
      paid in capital for stock-based compensation, and $737,000 in RRP transactions.
      Since September 2005, we have purchased a total of 499,400 shares of common
      stock, which are held as treasury shares.  

During
      the third quarter 2005, the Company completed its first stock repurchase program
      and announced a second repurchase plan for up to 2.2 million shares. Repurchases
      under the authorized plan for the current quarter totaled 473,171 shares at
      a
      purchase price of $5.3 million. As of December 31, 2005 the Company had
      authorization to purchase up to additional 834,299 shares of common stock.
      Also
      during the first quarter of fiscal 2006, 4,000 shares of restricted stock were
      granted from treasury shares. Bank Tier I capital to assets stands at 8.37%
      at
      December 31, 2005. Tangible capital at the holding company level is 9.03%.

      to
      $21.6 million for the same period in the prior year. Non-interest income
      increased $330,000, or 8.2%, to $4.4 million for the three months ended December
      31, 2005 compared to $4.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2004.
      Non-interest expense decreased $300,000, or 1.7%, to $17.4 million for the

Tax
                equivalent adjustment for tax exempt income is based on a 35% federal
                rate.   

Net
      interest income    
      for the
      three months ended December 31, 2005 decreased by $643,000, or 3.0%, to $21.1
      million for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, compared to $21.7 million
      for
      the quarter ended December 31, 2004. Gross interest income increased by $3.1
      million, or 11.1%, to $31.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2005,
      compared to $28.0 million for the same three months in 2004. The increase in
      interest income was largely due to a $83.9 million increase in average earning
      assets to $2.3 billion during the quarter ended December 31, 2005, as compared
      to $2.2 billion for the same quarter in the prior year. The increase is
      primarily due to the increase in loans, with the highest concentration coming
      from commercial loans, followed by consumer loans. The increase in average
      earning assets was also enhanced by an increase in average yield of 40 basis
      points from 5.15% to 5.55%, on a fully taxable equivalent basis. The average
      yields on the loan and investment portfolios increased 43 basis points and
      16
      basis points, respectively. Interest expense increased by $3.7 million for
      the
      quarter compared to the same quarter in 2004, as average interest-bearing
      liabilities increased by $62.0 million and the average cost of interest-bearing
      liabilities increased by 77 basis points. The increase in liabilities was used
      to fund loan growth, the decline in deposits and stock repurchases. The tax
      equivalent net interest margin declined by 22 basis points to 3.78%, while
      net
      interest spread declined by 38 basis points to 3.34%. This was primarily the
      result of the increase in borrowings as previously mentioned, along with the
      impact of the increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities resulting
      from the 250 basis point increase in the target federal funds rate since
      September of 2004.

Provision
      for Loan Losses.    
      The
      Company records provisions for loan losses, which are charged to earnings,
      in
      order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level to absorb probable
      loan losses inherent in the existing portfolio. The Company recorded $300,000
      in
      loan loss provisions for the three months ended December 31, 2005. Net
      charge-offs for the three months ended December 31, 2005 were $489,000 compared
      to $218,000 for the same period in 2004. (See Note 6 in Item 1 for further
      detail).  

Non-interest
      income    
      was $4.4
      million for the three months ended December 31, 2005 compared to $4.0 million
      for the three months ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $330,000, or 8.2%.
      Deposit fees and service charges increased by $135,000 or 5.3%, which was
      primarily due to volume-driven increases in overdraft, non-sufficient funds,
      and
      ATM and debit card fees. Income derived from the Company s bank owned life
      insurance ( BOLI ) investments increased by $97,000 or 30.7% due to additional
      BOLI investments of $10 million. Title insurance fee income derived from the
      Company s wholly-owned title subsidiary, Hardenburgh Abstract Company, Inc., was
      $416,000 for the quarter, up $58,000, or 16.2% from the prior year. There were
      no sales of securities this quarter and thus no gains or losses, compared to
      the
      $49,000 in gains for the same period last year. During the three-month period
      ended December 31, 2005, the Company also recorded losses on sales of loans
      totaling $20,000 compared to $59,000 in gains for the same period last year.

Non-interest
      expense     for
      the
      three months ended December 31, 2005 decreased by $300,000, or 1.7%, despite
      an
      increase of $672,000 in stock based compensation discussed below, as a result
      of
      our continued efforts towards efficiency, as well the full integration of our
      acquisitions. In addition, as a result of our integration efforts, we closed
      three branches and combined them with other larger branches. Compensation and
      employee benefits expense was relatively flat this period as compared to the
      same period last year. However, there was an increase in the cost of stock-based
      compensation benefits of $672,000, or 80.0%, primarily due to the aforementioned
      adoption of SFAS No. 123R and the acceleration of vesting for certain restricted
      stock grants of $365,000 and $368,000, respectively. Occupancy and office
      operations increased by $488,000 or 22.7%, to $2.6 million, for the three months
      ended December 31, 2005, due to the increased office space required to
      accommodate the increase in the Bank s size subsequent to the acquisitions, as
      well as space necessary to fulfill the requirements of our new in-house
      data-center, completed November 2005. In addition, there was $56,300 in costs
      related to branch closings. We chose to move our data services in-house, to
      (1)
      achieve greater efficiencies and security, (2) maintain a fixed level of
      operational costs, and (3) be in the position to accommodate an increase in
      volume, such as from an acquisition, without adding incremental costs.
      Advertising and promotion decreased $571,000 or 49.1%, primarily as a result
      of
      the completion of our new brand identity initiative in fiscal 2005. Data and
      check processing fees decreased $370,000, or 29.6%, primarily due to the new
      in-house data-center, which decreased our reliance on outside services and
      yielded significant cost savings in outside management fees and
      telecommunication costs. Merger and integration costs decreased $380,000, or
      100.0% from the same quarter last year, as there were no acquisitions entered
      into during the quarter. Other non-interest expense decreased $59,000, or 3.0%,
      due to the gains in efficiency and branch closings previously
      mentioned. 

The
      efficiency ratio, which excludes securities gains, merger costs and amortization
      of intangible assets, and includes the tax-equivalent adjustment for interest
      income, has increased to 64.0% for the current quarter from 62.5% for the
      quarter ending December 31, 2004. The change reflects the increase in interest
      expense relative to interest income, partially offset by non interest-related
      income and expenses (non interest expense included the increase in stock-based
      compensation noted above) and operating leverage derived from the integration
      of
      the acquisitions. [see below table]. 

Management
      believes that the adjusted efficiency ratio, detailed below, reflects a more
      accurate portrayal of the operations of the Company, than a simple GAAP
      efficiency ratio, as the adjusted ratio excludes the expenses related to
      acquired entities and securities transactions and gives effect to tax efficiency
      related to purchases of tax-exempt securities.  

27 

Efficiency
      Ratio  

Income
      Taxes.     Income
      tax expense was $2.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2005,
      compared to $2.9 million for the same period in 2004. The effective tax rates
      were 33.0% and 36.3%, respectively. The reduction in the effective rate is
      primarily due to increased utilization of tax efficient instruments such as
      investment in tax exempt securities and the increased in utilization of bank
      owned life insurance. 

Utilization
      of real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) reduced state tax expense, net of
      federal expense, by reducing the effective rate to 34.7% and 38.4% for December
      2005 vs. December 2004. New York State has been reviewing the tax status of
      REITs for several years and there can be no assurance that the benefits derived
      from utilization of REITs will continue to be realized by the Company.

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources   

The
      objective of the Company's liquidity management is to ensure the availability
      of
      sufficient cash flows to meet all financial commitments and to capitalize on
      opportunities for expansion. Liquidity management addresses the Company s
      ability to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at contractual maturity, to
      repay borrowings as they mature, and to fund new loans and investments as
      opportunities arise. 

The
      Company s primary sources of funds are deposits, proceeds from principal and
      interest payments on loans and securities, wholesale borrowings, the proceeds
      from maturities of securities and short-term investments, and proceeds from
      sales of loans originated for sale and securities available for sale. Maturities
      and scheduled amortization of loans and securities, as well as proceeds from
      borrowings, are predictable sources of funds. Other funding sources, however,
      such as deposit inflows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by
      market interest rates, economic conditions and competition. 

The
      Company s primary investing activities are the origination of residential one-
      to four-family, commercial mortgage loans, commercial and industrial loans,
      second mortgages,  home  equity loans, the   purchase of
      investment securities and  mortgage-backed securities. During the
      three-months ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, loan
      originations, 

28 

excluding
      loans originated for sale, totaled $155.7 million and $101.6 million,
      respectively, and purchases of securities totaled $51.7 million and $273.3
      million, respectively. The decrease in security purchases for the quarter,
      as
      compared to the same quarter last year, reflects our focus to increase our
      loan
      portfolio, which increased $100.2 million from the same quarter last year.
      For
      the three-month periods ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, these investing
      activities were funded primarily by principal repayments on loans, by proceeds
      from sales and maturities of securities, changes in deposit balances, and by
      short-term borrowings. Loan origination commitments and undrawn lines of credit
      totaled $300.0 million at December 31, 2005. The Company anticipates that it
      will have sufficient funds available to meet current loan commitments. At
      September 30, 2005 the Company had investments of $37.7 million in BOLI
      contracts. . In addition, the Company recorded an additional $413,000 in BOLI
      during the quarter. Such investments are illiquid and are therefore classified
      as other assets. Earnings from BOLI are derived from the net increase in cash
      surrender value of the BOLI contracts and the proceeds from the payment on
      the
      insurance policies, if any. 

Deposit
      flows are generally affected by the level of interest rates, the interest rates
      and products offered by local competitors, the appeal of non-deposit
      investments, and other factors. The net decrease in total deposits for the
      three
      months ended December 31, 2005 was $51.1 million, compared to a $26.5 million
      decrease during the same period last year. 

The
      Company monitors its liquidity position on a daily basis. We generally remain
      fully invested and utilize additional sources of funds through Federal Home
      Loan
      Bank of New York advances and repurchase agreements, of which $524.3 million
      was
      outstanding at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2005 we had the ability to
      borrow an additional $67.5 million under our credit facilities with the Federal
      Home Loan Bank. The Bank may borrow an additional $450,212 by pledging
      securities not required to be pledged for other purposes as of December 31,
      2005.  

At
      September 30, 2005, the Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements
      with a Tier 1 capital (leverage) level of $206.1 million, or 8.4% of adjusted
      assets (which is above the required level of $98.5 million, or 4.0%, minimum
      requirement) and a total risk-based capital level of $227.7 million, or 13.2%
      of
      risk-weighted assets (which is above the required level of $138.6 million,
      or
      8.0%). Regulations require leverage and total risk-based capital ratios of
      5.0%
      and 10.0%, respectively, in order to be classified as well-capitalized. In
      performing this calculation, the intangible assets recorded as a result of
      acquisitions are deducted from capital and from total adjusted assets for
      purposes of regulatory capital measures. At December 31, 2005, the Bank exceeded
      all capital requirements for the well-capitalized classification. These capital
      requirements, which are applicable to the Bank only, do not consider additional
      capital retained at the holding company level. 

29 

The
      following table sets forth the Bank s regulatory capital position at December
      31, 2005 and September 30, 2005, compared to OTS requirements. 

Recent
      Accounting Standards  

In
      December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148,    Accounting
      for Stock-Based Compensation     
         Transition
      and Disclosure     
         an
      amendment of FASB Statement No. 123.    This
      statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change
      to
      the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation.
      In addition, this statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement
      No.
      123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial
      statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation
      and the effects of the method used on reported results. The provisions of this
      statement did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial
      statements. 

In
      December 2004, the FASB Issued SFAS No. 123R ( SFAS  No. 123R),  Share-Based
      Payments , the provisions of which became effective for the corporation
      beginning in fiscal 2006. This Statement eliminates the alternative to use
      APB
      No. 25 s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in Statement No.
      123 as originally issued. SFAS No. 123R requires companies to recognize the
      cost
      of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments
      based
      on the grant-date fair value of those awards. While the fair-value-based method
      prescribed by Statement No. 123R is similar to the fair-value-based method
      disclosed under the provisions of Statement No. 123 in most respects, there
      are
      some differences. The effects of SFAS No. 123R for the first quarter ending
      December 31, 2005 were a $365,000 charge to pretax income and a $237,000
      reduction of net income. 

Effective
      March 31, 2004 Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 03-1 The Meaning of
      Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments
      ( EITF 03-1 ) was issued.  EITF 03-1 provides   guidance
      for   determining the  meaning of  other-than-temporarily
      impaired  and  its application to  certain debt   and equity
      securities within the scope of  

30 

Statement
      of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115   Accounting
      for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity rates (  Securities ( SFAS 115 ) and
      investments accounted for under the cost method. The guidance requires that
      investments which have declined in value due to credit concerns or solely due
      to
      changes in interest rates ( other than temporary impairment ) must be recorded
      for as are loans under the AICPA s Statement of Position 03-3 ( SOP 03-3 ) on
      purchased loans, which provides guidance on the treatment of potential credit
      losses (unrecoverable principle) and decreased, or lower then expected yields.
      There were no additional securities considered impaired during the
      quarter. 

In
      May
      2005, the FASB Issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 154 ( SFAS
      154 ),     Accounting
      Changes and Error Corrections   , 
      replacing APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No.3, which changes the
      treatment and reporting requirements for both accounting errors and changes
      of
      accounting principles, and provides guidance on determining the treatment of
      the
      retrospective application of a change. This Statement applies to all voluntary
      changes in accounting principles. At this time management believes this
      statement will have no impact on the reporting of our operations or financial
      condition.  

In
      December 2003, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee ( AcSEC ) issued
      Statement of Position ( SOP ) 03-3,     Accounting
      for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer.     
The
      SOP
      is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after December 15,
      2004. The SOP addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash
      flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial
      investment in loans or debt securities (loans) acquired in a transfer if those
      differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. The SOP
      applies to loans acquired in business combinations but does not apply to loans
      originated by the Company. Management does not believe the provision of this
      standard will have a material impact on the results of future
      operations. 

Item
      3.          Quantitative
      and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

The
      Company s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk, as the
      majority of its assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest
      rates. The Bank s interest rates risk profile has not changed significantly
      since September 30, 2005. Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market
      risk is presented at September 30, 2005 in Item 7A of the Company s Annual
      Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
      December 12, 2005. The following is an update of the discussion provided
      therein. 

The
      table
      below sets forth, as of December 31, 2005, the estimated changes in our net
      portfolio value and our net tax equivalent interest income that would result
      from the designated instantaneous changes in the U.S. Treasury yield curve.
      Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are
      based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest
      rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as
      indicative of actual results. 

31 

The
      table
      set forth above indicates that at December 31, 2005, in the event of an
      immediate 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would be expected
      to
      experience a 4.47% increase in NPV and a 0.09% increase in net interest income.
      In the event of an immediate 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we
      would be expected to experience a 18.40% decrease in NPV and a 4.34% decrease
      in
      net interest income. 

The
      Bank s interest rate profile has not changed significantly since September 30,
      2005. As a result, the Bank has maintained an overall relatively neutral net
      interest income sensitivity position. The Federal Reserve has increased short
      term rates 50 basis points since September 30, 2005, increasing the Federal
      Funds Rate from 3.75% to 4.25%, while longer term interest rates (10-year
      treasury) have remained relatively unchanged with the average for the three
      months ended December 31, 2004 of 4.26% virtually identical to the average
      for
      the three months ended December 31, 2005, resulting in a  flat  yield curve. As
      a result of this the Bank s average cost of interest bearing liabilities has
      increased faster than the average increase in asset yields, resulting in a
      compression of the Bank s net interest margin. Should the yield curve remain
 flat , a continued decline in net interest margin may occur, offsetting a
      portion of gains in net interest income arising from increasing volume of assets
      generated. Conversely, should market interest rates fall below today s level the
      Company s net interest margin could also be negatively affected, as competitive
      pressures could keep the Bank from lowering rates on its deposits, and
      prepayments and curtailments on assets may continue. Such movements may cause
      a
      decrease in the interest rate spread and net interest margin.  

General:
      The Company s largest component of market risk continues to be interest rate
      risk. The Company is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity
      price
      risk. At December 31, 2005, neither the Company nor the Bank owned any trading
      assets, nor did they utilize hedging transactions such as interest rate swaps
      and caps. 

Interest
      Rate Risk Compliance: The Bank continues to monitor the impact of interest
      rate
      volatility upon net interest income and net portfolio value in the same manner
      as at September 30, 2005. There have been no changes in the board approved
      limits of acceptable variances in net interest income and net portfolio value
      change through December 31, 2005 compared to September 30, 2005, and the impact
      of possible changes within the Company s models continue to fall within all
      board approved limits for potential interest rate volatility. 

Item
      4.          Controls
      and Procedures  

The
      Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
      Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
      Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and
      15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) (the  Exchange
      Act ) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that
      evaluation, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and
      Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of the end of the period covered
      by
      this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to
      ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company
      files   

32 

or
      submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
      within the time frames specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 

There
      were no significant changes made in the Company s internal controls over
      financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect the
      Company s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by
      this report.
