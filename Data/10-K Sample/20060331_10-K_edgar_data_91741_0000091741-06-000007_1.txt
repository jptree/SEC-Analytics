PART
      I   

Item
      1.        Business  

(a)       General
        Development of Business    .
        The
        Company is engaged in the operation of hotels that it owns or leases in Boston
        (Cambridge), Massachusetts; Key Biscayne, Florida; and New Orleans, Louisiana.
        It also operates, under management agreements, hotels in Southampton, Bermuda
        (until June 1, 2004); New Orleans, Louisiana; Coconut Grove, Florida; Sunny
        Isles Beach, Florida; and Cairo, Luxor, Port Said, Taba and Sharm el Sheikh
        (2),
        Egypt; and three Nile River cruise vessels. The Company has also entered
        into
        management agreements to operate new hotels being created in Orlando, Florida
        and Hammamat Pharoun and Ras Sedr, Egypt. In addition, the Company has franchise
        agreements for hotels in St. Maarten, Brazil and Peru. A licensed property
        in
        Sao Paulo, Brazil, opened in December 2004, and a licensed hotel was added
        in
        St. Maarten in July 2004.  

The
        Company
        transferred the land and improvements of Sonesta Beach Resort Key Biscayne
        to a
        development partnership, of which it is a 50% owner, in April 2005. Detailed
        information regarding this major transaction is incorporated by reference
        from
        Note 2 to the Company s consolidated financial statements (pages 16 through 18
        of the Annual Report to Shareholders, filed herewith as Exhibit 13).

In
        general,
        business levels declined during 2005. Revenues of Royal Sonesta Hotel Boston
        (Cambridge) increased, but Royal Sonesta Hotel New Orleans and Sonesta Beach
        Resort Key Biscayne both experienced a decline in revenues in 2005 compared
        to
        2004. In addition, income from management activities decreased in 2005 compared
        to 2004. 

(b)
               Financial
        Information About Segments    .
        This
        information is incorporated by reference from Note 8 to the Company s
        consolidated financial statements (pages 21 and 22 of the 2005 Annual Report
        to
        Shareholders, filed herewith as Exhibit 13).  

(c)       Narrative
        Description of Business    .
        The
        Company's business is to a great extent dependent upon a high level of economic
        activity. The hotel business is highly competitive. The facilities of
        competitors are often affiliated with national or regional chains having
        more
        room accommodations and greater financial resources than the Company. The
        Company follows the practice of refurnishing and redecorating the hotels
        which
        it operates in order to keep the properties attractive and competitive with
        new
        hotel properties, and this requires the Company to make substantial capital
        expenditures. During the two years ended December 31, 2005, the Company made
        such capital expenditures totaling approximately $8,851,000.  

The
      Company
      endeavors to create individual and distinctive features for each hotel property
      while utilizing common corporate identification in order to obtain the benefits
      of chain operation. The Company is using the name "Sonesta" for all of its
      hotels. 

The
      Company
      has approximately 1,319 employees. The Company considers its relations with
      its
      employees to be satisfactory.  

While
      the
      business of the Company's individual hotels is seasonal, the diverse locations
      of the Company s three owned or leased properties tend to mitigate the impact of
      this factor. Traditionally, only the third quarter has produced significantly
      less revenues and operating income than the first, second and fourth quarters,
      although these seasonal fluctuations do not materially affect the Company's
      business activities.  

The
      following
      tables reflects total revenues, annual occupancy percentages, average room
      rates
      and room revenues per available room ("REVPAR") for the Company's owned and
      leased properties for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003. REVPAR is calculated by
      dividing annual room revenue by the total number of rooms available during
      the
      year.  

(1)    
             
                In
                April 2005 the Company transferred the land and improvements of Sonesta
                Beach Resort Key Biscayne to a development partnership of which the
                Company is a 50% owner. 

Note:
      Royal Sonesta Hotel New Orleans did not generate revenues for a 15 day period
      following Hurricane Katrina. The number of rooms available is adjusted
      accordingly. 

The
      Company has established and maintains trademark protection for certain service
      marks it uses in conducting its business, including the service marks "Sonesta",
      "Sonesta Beach", "Just Us Kids", and the Company's stylized "S" logo. Trademarks
      are maintained in numerous countries, besides the United States. Each mark
      is
      generally protected for several years, subject to periodic renewal.

For
      revenues by types of services provided for the three years ended December 31,
      2005, reference is made to the Consolidated Statements of Operations which
      appear on page 10 of the 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders, filed herewith
      as
      Exhibit 13.  

(d)        Financial
        Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations    .
        This
        information is incorporated by reference from Note 8 on pages 21 and 22 of
        the
        2005 Annual Report to Shareholders, filed herewith as Exhibit 13.
 
   Item
      1A.        Risk
      Factors  

The
      Company s business is subject to various risks that could have a negative effect
      on the Company s results from operations and its financial condition. These
      risks could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in
      forward-looking statements contained in the Managements  Discussion and Analysis
      and the footnotes to the Company s 2005 Annual Report, which is filed herewith
      as Exhibit 13. 

The
      lodging industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with much larger
      hotel chains, and its ability to compete successfully depends on its ability
      to
      offer business and leisure travelers lodging products and services that are
      perceived to be of equal of better quality and value than those offered by
      its
      competitors. 

The
      Company is subject to a range of operating risks common to the hotel industry.
      These operating risks include, but are not limited to: 

1)    
               
                  the
                  availability of and demand for hotel rooms in the markets we
                  operate; 

2)    
               
                  international,
                  national and regional economic and political
                  conditions; 

3)    
               
                  the
                  impact of war and terrorist activity (including threats of terrorist
                  activity and other matter that influence and/or limit travel, such
                  as
                  travelers  fears of contagious diseases (i.e. Asian
                  Flu); 

4)    
               
                  the
                  occurrence of natural disasters, such as
                  hurricanes; 

5)    
               
                  taxes
                  and government regulations that influence or determine wages, and
                  cost
                  prices of goods and services the Company uses to operate our
                  hotels; 

6)    
               
                  the
                  availability and cost of capital to allow us and potential hotel
                  owners
                  and joint venture partners to fund
                  investments; 

7)    
               
                  relationships
                  and disputes with owners of our hotels operated under management
                  agreements. 

There
        are
        certain risks that pose a more significant threat to the Company s future
        results and financial condition, because of the particular businesses the
        Company is involved in, and the markets in which we operate. These
        include: 

1)    
               
                  the
                  Company is a 50% partner in a development partnership, which was
                  created
                  in 2005 to redevelop the site of Sonesta Beach Resort Key Biscayne.
                  This
                  transaction is described in detail in Note 2 on pages 16 through
                  18 of the
                  2005 Annual Report to Shareholders, filed herewith as Exhibit 13.
                  The
                  Company received approximately $60 million in non-refundable proceeds
                  in
                  April 2005 after it contributed the land and improvements of Sonesta
                  Beach
                  Resort Key Biscayne to the development partnership. In addition,
                  the
                  Company received an equity position, valued by the partnership
                  at $60
                  million. Future proceeds are dependent on the successful development
                  of a
                  new resort, and the sales of condominium units at sufficient prices
                  to
                  cover all costs of the development and construction of the new
                  resort; 

2)    
               
                  a
                  major portion of the Company s revenues and income is derived from its
                  owned and leased hotels, and from its managed hotels, in the United
                  States. Of the Company s six (6) U.S. hotels, three (3) are located in the
                  Miami, Florida area, two (2) are located in New Orleans, and one
                  (1) is
                  located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This means the Company s future
                  results are heavily dependent on the market conditions and the
                  supply of
                  and demand for hotel rooms in these specific
                  markets; 

3)    
               
                  five
                  of the Company s six U.S. hotels are located either in New Orleans or in
                  the Miami, Florida area. These areas are prone to hurricanes, and
                  the
                  Company s financial condition will be impacted if its hotels suffer damage
                  from hurricanes, as well as from the loss of business due to hurricane
                  activity in these areas. In 2005, the Company s results were impacted by
                  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which affected the New Orleans region,
                  and by
                  Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, which affected the Miami, Florida
                  area. As a result of the high cost of insurance for these catastrophic
                  risks, damage to hotels and loss of income may only be partially
                  covered
                  by insurance, since the Company, and the owners of the Company s managed
                  hotels, have significant deductibles, and certain caps on coverages
                  for
                  windstorm and flood; 

4)    
               
                  the
                  Company operates two (2) hotels in New Orleans, Louisiana. The
                  business in
                  this market has historically been heavily dependent on group and
                  convention business. Hurricane Katrina, which struck New Orleans
                  on August
                  29, 2005, caused major damage to the city s convention center and
                  infrastructure, which caused the cancellation of substantially
                  all group
                  and convention business following the storm. To date, the Company s
                  hotels, in particular Royal Sonesta Hotel New Orleans, have been
                  successful in replacing the convention business with government
                  business
                  and other business related to the recovery and rebuilding efforts
                  in New
                  Orleans. Going forward, especially when more hotels reopen after
                  repairing
                  damage from the storm, results of New Orleans hotels will be heavily
                  dependent on the return of group and convention business to the
                  City of
                  New Orleans. In addition, the impact of Hurricane Katrina forced
                  a very
                  significant number of the Company s employees to leave the City due to
                  lack of housing. Replacement staff is in very short supply, and
                  the hotels
                  will face an increase in payroll costs as a result, especially
                  as they
                  resume full business operations, including operations of all food
                  and
                  beverage outlets; 

5)    
               
                  during
                  2005, the Company s management revenues from its hotels in Egypt totaled
                  approximately $1.9 million ($2.0 million in 2004). In previous
                  years,
                  Egypt has experienced terrorist activity, which affected tourism.
                  Potential future terrorist incidents will affect tourism to Egypt,
                  and the
                  Company s management income from this
                  region. 

Item
      2.          Properties  

The
      Company's hotels are primarily metropolitan and resort hotels in popular
      vacation areas which emphasize luxury accommodations and personal service.

The
      Company has fee ownership in Royal Sonesta Hotel, Boston (Cambridge),
      Massachusetts. Sonesta Beach Resort Key Biscayne was owned by the Company until
      April 2005, when it transferred the land and assets into a development
      partnership, of which the Company is a 50% owner. Since April 2005, the Key
      Biscayne property is operated under a $1 per year lease with the development
      partnership. The Company expects operations to cease in August 2006. Detailed
      information regarding this major transaction is incorporated by reference from
      Note 2 to the Company s consolidated financial statements (pages 16 through 18
      of the Annual Report to Shareholders, filed herewith as Exhibit 13). Reference
      is made to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of
      the
      Company which appear on pages 18 and 19 of the Company's 2005 Annual Report
      to
      Shareholders, filed herewith as Exhibit 13, for details of the mortgage lien
      on
      the Boston (Cambridge), Massachusetts property. 

The
      Company operates the Royal Sonesta Hotel, New Orleans, Louisiana under a
      long-term lease which expires on September 30, 2024, provided the Company
      exercises its remaining ten-year extension option. As of March 14, 2006, The
      Company has exercised options through September 30, 2014. 

The
      Company also operates under management agreements hotels in Coconut Grove
      (Miami), Florida; Sunny Isles Beach, Florida; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Cairo,
      Luxor, Port Said, Taba and Sharm el Sheikh (2), Egypt; and three Nile River
      cruise vessels. A management agreement for a hotel in Southampton, Bermuda
      ended
      June 1, 2004. The Company has granted licenses for the use of its name to six
      (6) hotels in Peru. The Company granted a license to a hotel in St. Maarten,
      commencing July 2004, and to a hotel that opened in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in
      December 2004.  

In
      addition to the properties listed above, the Company leases space for its
      executive offices at 116 Huntington Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02116. That
      lease commenced May 1, 2002, and has a 10-year term.  

Item
      3.        Legal
      Proceedings   

Trump
      International Sonesta Beach Resort Sunny Isles   

Sonesta
      Hotels of Florida, Inc. ( SHF ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,
      operates Trump International Sonesta Beach Resort, in Sunny Isles, Florida
      (the
 Hotel ), under a management agreement with the Hotel s owner, Sunny Isles
      Luxury Ventures L.C. ( SILV ). The Hotel opened for business in April 2003. The
      Hotel is a condominium hotel, and the guestrooms are owned by third party buyers
      and, to the extent condominium units remain unsold, by SILV. The management
      agreement includes an option for SHF to purchase the Hotel s non-guestroom areas
      (the  Hotel Lot ) and meeting facilities (the  Commercial Lot ). The combined
      purchase price is twenty four million dollars ($24,000,000), which would be
      100%
      financed by SILV by means of a non-recourse, 25-year loan secured by a mortgage
      on the Hotel and Commercial Lot. SHF exercised its purchase option for the
      Hotel
      Lot in September 2004, and the parties agreed that they would close the
      transaction in early January 2005. Despite its earlier agreements, SILV took
      the
      position that it would not close on this transaction and, in response, the
      Company filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of the 11   th   
      Judicial
      Circuit in Miami-Dade County, Florida, to compel SILV to close the transaction.
      In connection with a mediation procedure, SILV and the Company entered into
      an
      agreement in September 2005 pursuant to which, subject to certain contingencies,
      the transaction would close in January 2006. In addition, the Company and SILV
      agreed on the amount of pre-opening expenses the Company advanced and is
      entitled to receive back following a completion of the purchase transaction;
      and
      also agreed on the amount SILV is entitled to for the Company s contribution to
      the hotel s non-guestroom furniture, fixtures and equipment. Both these issues
      were the subject of previous arbitration procedures. SILV and the Company have
      been working on finalizing closing documents, but the actual closing has been
      further delayed as certain items in the agreement of September 2005 have not
      been concluded, and additional issues have been raised. The Company will
      continue to work on finding an amicable solution to these issues, but doesn t
      preclude going back to court to compel SILV to close on the transaction.
      Meanwhile, the Company settled the amount owed for pre-opening expenses, after
      deducting amounts owed to SILV for the Company s FF E contribution, from
      hotel funds that would otherwise be owed to SILV. If the closing of the purchase
      takes place pursuant to the agreement reached in September 2005, minimum annual
      payments due to SILV would increase from the current $800,000 due under the
      management agreement to $900,000 in 2006, and increase by $50,000 increments
      each year to a maximum of $1,100,000 in 2010 and each year thereafter.
      Therefore, the delay has no detrimental effect on the Company s cash flow. Based
      on the terms of the September 2005 agreement, and assuming the purchase will
      be
      completed, the Company s management and ownership of the Hotel and Commercial
      Lot beyond January 2008 is subject to certain contingencies, which include
      standards regarding the quality of the operations. 

Chateau
      Sonesta Hotel New Orleans  

A
      subsidiary of the Company, Sonesta Louisiana Hotels Corporation ( SLHC ), which
      operates Chateau Sonesta Hotel, in New Orleans (the  Hotel ), was involved in an
      arbitration pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement between the owner
      of the Hotel and SLHC. The owner alleged that SLHC failed to perform certain
      obligations under the Management Agreement, specifically its obligations to
      (A)
 use all reasonable efforts to operate the Hotel in a manner that achieves a
      high level of guest satisfaction and profitability , and (B) exercise all
      reasonable efforts to assure that Sonesta Hotels  corporate services  are billed
      to the Hotel and to the Royal Sonesta Hotel, New Orleans on a fair and equitable
      basis . The position established by owner s arbiter claimed damages of
      $2,952,000, and SLHC s arbiter maintained that no more than $268,000 in damages
      should be awarded. In May 2004, a decision was rendered in favor of SLHC by
      a
      third arbiter selected by the parties. The Company recorded expenses of $281,000
      and $847,000 in 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to the award for damages
      of
      $268,000, as well as its share of the costs of the arbitration, and the
      Company s legal and consulting fees. 

The
      Company is also from time to time subject to routine litigation incidental
      to
      its business, and generally covered by insurance. The Company believes that
      the
      results of such litigation will not have a materially adverse effect on the
      Company s financial condition.

      undertaken by the Company s auditors unless the engagement is specifically
      approved by the Company s Audit Committee or the services are included within a
      category which has been pre-approved by the Audit Committee. The maximum charge
      for services is established by the audit committee when the specific engagement
      or the category of services is approved or pre-approved. In certain
      circumstances, management is required to notify the   A  udit
      Committee when pre-approved services are undertaken and the Committee or its
      Chairman may approve amendments or modifications of the engagement or the
      maximum fees. 

The
      Company s Audit Committee will not approve engagements of the Company s auditors
      to perform non-audit services for the Company if doing so will cause the
      auditors to cease to be independent within the meaning of applicable SEC or
      NASDAQ rules. In other circumstances, the Audit Committee considers among other
      things, whether the auditors are able to provide the required services in a
      more
      or less effective and efficient manner than other available service
      providers. 

Since
      May
      6, 2003, the date when SEC rules relating to approval of services by auditors
      became effective, all services for which the Company engaged the auditors were
      approved by the Audit Committee. The total fees the Company paid to Vitale
      Caturano   Company Ltd. and Ernst   Young LLP for services in 2004 and
      2005 are set forth above.  

The
      Company s Audit Committee approved the engagement of Ernst   Young LLP and
      Vitale, Caturano   Company Ltd. to provide audit related services in 2004
      and 2005, respectively (which include the annual audits of the Company s Pension
      Plan and 401-K Plan) because it determined that for Ernst   Young LLP and
      Vitale, Caturano   Company Ltd. to provide these services would not
      compromise its independence, and that its familiarity with the Company s record
      keeping and accounting systems would permit them to provide these services
      with
      equal or higher quality, quicker and at a similar cost than the Company could
      obtain these services from other providers.

        Greaters for Nile Tourism, as Owner, and Sonesta, as Operator (the  Ship
        Management Agreement ). 

Amount
        of Loan    :
        U.S.
        $500,000.00, to be advanced on or about February 15, 2006 (the

        of Loan    :
        The
        Loan shall be repaid to Sonesta International Hotels Limited ( Lender ), in

TO
      OUR
      SHAREHOLDERS: 

For
      Sonesta, 2005 was a year of great fortune and great misfortune. In January,
      we
      announced that we would form a partnership with Fortune International and
      redevelop the site of our Sonesta Beach Resort, in Key Biscayne, Florida, as
      an
      ultra-luxury condominium hotel and residences. Upon the transfer of the property
      to the partnership, in April 2005, Sonesta received $60 Million, and will be
      entitled to another $60 Million on a priority basis from the net sale proceeds
      of condominium units. Consistent with our previous announcements regarding
      this
      project, the existing Resort has continued to operate, and will close in August
      of this year. We hope to begin construction of the new resort in 2007. Of
      course, the scope of the project, and timetables, are subject to our obtaining
      necessary permits and approvals, and financing. 

The
      re-development of Sonesta Key Biscayne has the potential to transform our
      Company. Cash from the transaction has, to date, funded improvements at Royal
      Sonesta Boston and a special dividend to shareholders, and has allowed us to
      establish cash reserves to fund foreseeable needs, and for investment
      opportunities.  

In
      late
      August we turned our attention to an entirely different matter: the devastation
      wrought in New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina. The impact of Katrina, and of
      Hurricane Rita, has been widely reported, and at this writing the human tragedy
      continues to unfold. Because our hotels are in the French Quarter, which is
      higher ground, they fared better than most others. Royal Sonesta Hotel suffered
      no flooding, sustained only superficial damage from the wind, and was open
      for
      business in mid-September. Chateau Sonesta Hotel experienced some flooding
      of
      its ground-level, but was able to reopen by December 1. For Sonesta, the real
      tragedy was experienced by our dedicated hotel employees, many of whom lost
      their houses and possessions, and were separated from family and
      friends. 

As
      a
      gesture of appreciation to the wonderful employees of our New Orleans hotels,
      we
      have featured them on the cover of this year s Annual Report. 

For
      the
      past 27 years, our Royal Sonesta Hotel New Orleans, the  Grand Dame  of the
      French Quarter, has enjoyed a reputation for excellence under the stewardship
      of
      Hans Wandfluh. Hans recently announced his decision to retire, and will leave
      the Hotel at the end of March 2006. We wish him happiness and good health as
      he
      pursues personal interests, and are pleased to report that Hans has agreed
      to
      maintain a relationship with Sonesta and be available to assist us with special
      projects. 

The
      vagaries of the weather also affected our three hotels in South Florida. While
      Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma did not cause extensive physical damage
      to
      our properties, they scared away business, costing our hotels hundreds of
      thousands of dollars of lost revenues. Despite the weather, Sonesta Hotel  
      Suites, in Coconut Grove, reported better results for the year. Trump Sonesta
      Resort, in Sunny Isles Beach, continues to improve financially. In spite of
      the
      bad weather, its results were significantly better than in 2004. 

As
      previously reported, the Company exercised its option to acquire the hotel
      operation at Trump Sonesta Resort, in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida, but we have
      not yet closed that transaction. In early 2005, we filed an action for specific
      performance in the Circuit Court, in Miami-Dade County, Florida, in order to
      compel the owner to complete the transaction, but no ruling has yet been made.
      In the meantime, we continue to operate the property under our long-term
      management contract. 

At
      the
      Royal Sonesta Hotel Boston we have taken steps to ensure that the hotel will
      turn around financially, including renovating our guestroom product and changing
      the concept of the Hotel s primary restaurant. We have also instituted a revenue
      management program for this and our other domestic managed hotels. We hope
      for,
      and expect, significant improvement in 2006. 

In
      Egypt,
      where the Company operates six (6) hotels and three (3) Nile River cruise ships,
      business has generally been good. In particular, our Cairo, Luxor, and Sharm
      el
      Sheikh hotels are performing well. In the coming months we will be launching
      two
      (2) new cruise ships: Sonesta Star Goddess and Sonesta St. George I - both
      of
      which will provide an ultra-luxury cruise experience. We continue to explore
      other management opportunities in Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle
      East. 

Among
      our
      licensed/franchised properties, Sonesta Maho Beach Resort, in St. Maarten,
      reports high satisfaction with its Sonesta affiliation. Recently, a hotel
      operating company acquired an interest in the six (6) Sonesta-flagged properties
      in Peru, and we look forward to exploring a new relationship with that company
      in Peru and elsewhere. In Brazil, Sonesta Hotel Sao Paulo Ibirapuera completed
      its first full year of operations in a highly competitive hotel
      market. 

If
      you
      would like additional information about Sonesta hotels, resorts, or cruises,
      please visit our website at www.sonesta.com 

We
      appreciate the continued interest and support of you, our shareholders, and
      of
      our hotel owners, guests, partners and employees.

MANAGEMENT'S
      DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
      CONDITION  

The
      Company's consolidated financial statements include the revenues, expenses,
      assets and liabilities of the Royal Sonesta Hotel Boston (Cambridge), Royal
      Sonesta Hotel New Orleans, and the Sonesta Beach Resort Key Biscayne. The Boston
      (Cambridge) property is owned by the Company, and the New Orleans hotel is
      operated under a long-term lease. The land and improvements of Sonesta Beach
      Resort Key Biscayne were transferred on April 19, 2005 to a development
      partnership, of which the Company is a 50% owner (see Note 2 - Operations).
      As
      of that date, the Company operates the hotel under a token ($1 per year) lease,
      until such time the hotel closes, which is currently estimated to occur in
      August 2006. The financial statements also include the Company s revenues and
      expenses from the management of properties in the United States, Bermuda (until
      May 2004) and Egypt, but exclude the revenues and expenses of the managed
      properties themselves.  

Results
      of Operations  

During
      2005, the Company recorded net income of $4,668,000, or $1.26 per share,
      compared to a net loss of $4,602,000, or $(1.24) per share, during 2004. The
      Company s 2005 operating income was affected by Hurricane Katrina, which reduced
      fee income from Chateau Sonesta Hotel New Orleans, and by hurricane activity
      in
      Florida, which impacted results at Sonesta Beach Resort Key Biscayne and the
      Company s two managed hotels in the Miami area. The resulting decrease in
      operating income of $3,407,000 was more than offset by increases in income
      as a
      result of the following: 

A
                reduction in interest expense primarily resulting from the repayment
                of
                the mortgage loan on Sonesta Beach Resort Key Biscayne in April 2005
                (see
                Note 2 - Operations).  

Increased
                interest income from the short term investment of cash proceeds received
                following the transfer of Sonesta Beach Resort Key Biscayne s assets in
                April 2005 (see Note 2 -
                Operations). 

The
                reversal of tax valuation reserves in 2005 as a result of the transfer
                of
                the land and improvements of Sonesta Beach Resort Key Biscayne (see
                Note 2
                - Operations and Note 10 - Income
                Taxes). 

In
      2006,
      the Company will continue to work on improving operating results, in particular
      at Royal Sonesta Hotel Boston (Cambridge), and at its two managed hotels in
      Coconut Grove and Sunny Isles, Florida. The Company has committed an additional
      $2.4 million for improvements to the quality of guestrooms at Royal Sonesta
      Boston (Cambridge). The Company is optimistic that these improvements, coupled
      with changes in hotel management and an expected increase in demand in the
      Boston/Cambridge area, will improve results at this location. To improve its
      income from management activities, the Company continues to focus on increasing
      profitability at Sonesta Hotel   Suites Coconut Grove and Trump
      International Sonesta Beach Resort Sunny Isles. Once the minimum returns due
      under the management agreements for these properties are earned, the Company
      will collect substantial fee income. In April 2005, the Company reduced rental
      payments to unit owners at the Sunny Isles hotel, and additional marketing
      charges to the unit owners were implemented at the Coconut Grove hotel in an
      effort to reduce costs. These efforts, combined with revenue growth expected
      in
      2006 in the Miami market place, should provide the Company with additional
      management income from these hotels. 

Revenues  

2005
      versus 2004:    Total
      revenues in 2005 were $88,125,000 compared to $89,907,000 in 2004, a decrease
      of
      $1,782,000. Revenues at Royal Sonesta Hotel New Orleans decreased by $1,294,000
      as a result of the impact of Hurricane Katrina, which struck New Orleans on
      August 29, 2005. Sonesta Beach Resort Key Biscayne also experienced a decrease
      in 2005 revenues of $775,000 compared to 2004. This was mainly due to Hurricane
      Wilma, which affected business in October 2005. A more detailed analysis of
      the
      revenues by hotel, and of our management income, follows. 

Revenues
      of Sonesta Beach Resort Key Biscayne decreased by $775,000, or 3%, during 2005
      compared to 2004. Room revenues decreased by $151,000 due to a slight (1%)
      decrease in room revenue per available room ( REVPAR ). Occupancy decreased in
      2005, mainly as a result of hurricane activity, especially in October, when
      Hurricane Wilma caused the closure of the hotel for a week. Revenues from other
      sources, including food and beverage, decreased by $623,000, or 5%, in 2005,
      compared to 2004. This was due to the overall decrease in occupancy, and a
      decrease in room nights generated from the group and convention market segment,
      which affected banqueting revenues. Royal Sonesta Hotel Boston (Cambridge)
      increased revenues from $23,279,000 in 2004 to $23,986,000 in 2005, a $707,000
      increase. This was entirely due to an increase in room revenues resulting from
      a
      5% REVPAR increase mostly due to higher average room rates achieved. Occupancy
      in 2005 remained virtually the same compared to 2004. Total revenues at Royal
      Sonesta Hotel New Orleans during 2005 were $32,757,000 compared to $34,051,000
      in 2004, a $1,294,000 decrease. Business in New Orleans was seriously affected
      by the impact of Hurricane Katrina, which struck New Orleans on August 29,
      2005.
      Total revenues during the month of September 2005 were $1,350,000 lower compared
      to September 2004, which erased the increase in revenues achieved during the
      first eight months of 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2005, revenues were
      $1,122,000 lower than during the 2004 fourth quarter, due to reduced revenues
      primarily from food and beverage sales, since not all of the hotel s food and
      beverage outlets were in operation, and due to the absence of group and
      convention business, which usually generates substantial banqueting revenues.
      Room revenues during the 2005 fourth quarter actually increased compared to
      2004. Since the hotel had only minor damage it was able to capture substantial
      government business, and other business related to the recovery and rebuilding
      efforts in New Orleans. Revenues from management activities decreased from
      $4,407,000 in 2004 to $3,987,000 in 2005, a $420,000 decrease. This was mainly
      due to a decrease in management income from Chateau Sonesta Hotel New Orleans.
      That hotel was closed from August 29 to November 30, 2005 to repair damage
      sustained from Hurricane Katrina. Increased license fee income from Sonesta
      Maho
      Beach Resort   Casino, St Maarten, which was added during the summer of
      2004, was offset by decreased fee income from Sonesta Beach Resort Bermuda,
      which management agreement ended in 2004.  

3 

2004
      versus 2003    :
         Total
      revenues in 2004 were $89,907,000 compared to $84,896,000 in 2003, which
      represented an increase of $5,011,000, or 6%. All three owned and leased hotels
      increased revenues during 2004, as business levels continued to improve.
      Revenues from management activities increased by 27% compared to 2003, primarily
      from increased income from the Company s hotels in Egypt. A more detailed
      discussion of the revenues by hotel, and of our management income,
      follows. 

Sonesta
      Beach Resort Key Biscayne reported a 6% increase in revenues during 2004
      compared to 2003. Of the total revenue increase of $1,583,000, $887,000 was
      due
      to increased room revenues. The room revenue per available room (REVPAR)
      increased by 6%, due primarily to an increase in occupancy levels. The increased
      occupancy was a result of increased demand from both the transient as well
      as
      the group and convention market segments. Revenues from other sources, including
      food and beverage, increased by $696,000, due to the higher occupancy achieved
      in 2004. Royal Sonesta Hotel Boston (Cambridge) reported a $1,657,000 increase
      in revenues, or 8%, during 2004 compared to 2003. This increase in revenues
      was
      almost entirely due to improved results during the second half of the year.
      Of
      the increase in revenues, $1,347,000 resulted from increased room revenues,
      and
      $310,000 was due to increases in other revenues, primarily from sales of food
      and beverages. During 2004, the hotel reported a 10% increase in REVPAR, due
      to
      both higher occupancies as well as a 5% increase in average room rates achieved.
      Increases in business were primarily from the group and convention market
      segment. Royal Sonesta Hotel New Orleans recorded 2004 revenues of $34,051,000
      compared to $33,210,000 in 2003, an increase of 841,000, or 2.5%. The slight
      increase in revenues was entirely due to an increase in room revenues because
      of
      a 3% REVPAR increase. Increases in average room rate achieved offset a slight
      decrease in occupancy levels, due to lower demand from the transient market
      segment. Group and convention business actually grew substantially during 2004
      compared to 2003, and offset part of the decline in transient business. Revenues
      from management activities increased from $3,477,000 in 2003 to $4,407,000
      in
      2004, an increase of $930,000. This increase was for the most part due to
      increases in income of $728,000 from the Company s managed hotels in Egypt.
      Travel to Egypt, primarily from Europe, continued to improve in 2004 compared
      to
      2003. Decreased income from Sonesta Beach Hotel Bermuda, which management
      agreement terminated on June 1, 2004, was offset by increased income from
      Chateau Sonesta Hotel New Orleans. In 2004, the Company received an incentive
      fee from Chateau Sonesta because of higher profit levels achieved by the hotel.
      The profit levels in 2003 were insufficient to earn an incentive
      fee. 

Operating
      Income  

                                    OPERATING
      INCOME/(LOSS) 

                                 (in
      thousands)     

2005
      versus 2004:    The
      Company recorded an operating loss of $1,905,000 in 2005, compared to operating
      income of $1,502,000 in 2004, a decrease of $3,407,000. The decline in income
      was primarily from a decrease in income of $1,678,000 at Sonesta Beach Resort
      Key Biscayne and an increase in the loss from management activities of
      $1,685,000. In Key Biscayne, revenues declined by $775,000, and expenses rose
      $903,000. Revenues from management activities decreased by $420,000, and
      corporate expenses related to these activities increased by $1,265,000. A
      detailed discussion of the changes in income by location, which includes an
      analysis of the increased expenses, follows. 

Sonesta
      Beach Resort Key Biscayne recorded an operating loss of $125,000 during 2005
      compared to operating income of $1,553,000 in 2004, a decrease of $1,678,000.
      Revenues decreased by $775,000 during 2005 compared to 2004, and overall
      expenses increased by $903,000. Revenues declined primarily due to increased
      hurricane activity in 2005. In October 2005, the hotel was closed for a week
      following Hurricane Wilma. Expenses increased due to increased costs and
      operating expenses ($360,000), due in part to higher cost of utilities,
      increased real estate taxes ($142,000) and higher repairs and maintenance
      expenses ($306,000). The hotel also recorded an increase in depreciation expense
      of $300,000. The net increase in depreciation expense resulted from the revision
      of useful lives of certain furniture and equipment at Sonesta Beach Key
      Biscayne, which is scheduled to cease operations in August 2006. This furniture
      and equipment was excluded from the transfer of the land and improvements of
      the
      hotel to a new development partnership (see Note 2 - Operations). The above
      expense increases were partially offset by lower administrative and general
      expenses, primarily from lower insurance expense, since the obligation to insure
      the building has been assumed by the partnership into which the hotel assets
      were transferred in April 2005 (see Note 2 - Operations). Even though the Key
      Biscayne hotel reported a $125,000 operating loss, the hotel contributed
      significantly to the Company s cash flow in 2005. The hotel s depreciation
      expense totaled $3,393,000 in 2005, and expenditures for capital replacements
      were minimal due to the planned closure of the hotel. In addition, no interest
      expense was incurred since April 2005, when the hotel s mortgage was repaid.
      Royal Sonesta Hotel Boston (Cambridge) reported operating income of $1,380,000
      during 2005, compared to $1,450,000 in 2004, a $70,000 decrease. Revenues in
      2005 increased by $707,000 but expenses increased by $777,000, representing
      a
      3.5% increase compared to 2004. The expense increase was almost entirely due
      to
      increased costs and operating expenses, resulting from increased payroll and
      employee benefit costs, as well as increased expenses for supplies and operating
      equipment in both the rooms and food and beverage departments. The hotel also
      increased its advertising efforts, especially on the internet. Operating income
      in 2005 at Royal Sonesta Hotel New Orleans was $1,349,000 compared to $1,323,000
      in 2004, a slight $26,000 increase. Total revenues in 2005 were $1,294,000
      lower
      than in 2004, due to the effect of Hurricane Katrina on the hotel s business in
      2005, but overall expenses decreased by $1,320,000 in 2005 compared to 2004.
      This was primarily due to lower costs and operating expenses and repairs and
      maintenance costs. After Hurricane Katrina, a significant number of the hotel s
      employees were unable to return, which forced the hotel to operate without
      all
      food and beverage facilities, and with limited services. The resulting decrease
      in payroll and other expenses offset the decrease in revenues, and increased
      costs directly related to the storm of approximately $635,000, which included
      rentals of emergency generators, spoiled inventories, and incentives for
      employees that secured and operated the hotel during the period immediately
      following the hurricane. The Company s loss from management activities, which is
      computed after giving effect to management and marketing fees from owned and
      leased hotels, increased from $2,824,000 in 2004 to $4,509,000 in 2005.
      Management revenues decreased by $420,000, and expenses related to these
      activities increased by $1,265,000. This increase in expenses was mainly due
      to
      an increase in administrative and general expenses. This resulted from the
      addition of a Vice President of Development to the corporate staff, and by
      increases in employee benefit costs, including health and pension benefits.
      In
      addition, the Company recorded an expense of $393,000 in 2005 resulting from
      a
      shortfall in achieving the minimum owners  return which the Company is committed
      to under its management agreement for Trump International Sonesta Beach Resort
      Sunny Isles. Finally, also included in 2005 is a $263,000 expense, since the
      Company may have to, after notice from the hotel s owner, cure a shortfall in
      achieving a performance threshold for the calendar year 2005 under the
      management agreement for Sonesta Hotel   Suites Coconut Grove. The hotel s
      owner will obtain the right to cancel the management agreement, if the Company,
      once it has been notified, declines to cure the 2005 shortfall. The hotel s
      owner and the Company have agreed to postpone the notice period until April
      15,
      2006, and will attempt to negotiate a mutually acceptable restructuring of
      the
      management agreement before then.

2004
      versus 2003:    The
      Company reported operating income of $1,502,000 in 2004, compared to a 2003
      operating loss of $1,191,000. Improvements in income at Sonesta Beach Resort
      Key
      Biscayne and Royal Sonesta Hotel Boston (Cambridge) offset decreased income
      from
      Royal Sonesta Hotel New Orleans. The decrease in income in New Orleans was
      due
      to an increase in rent based on the lease under which the Company operates
      the
      hotel. The loss from management activities during 2004 reduced substantially
      due
      to higher income achieved from hotels operated under management contracts,
      and
      because of costs and expenses recorded in 2003 related to the arbitration of
      a
      dispute with the owner of a managed hotel (see note 9, Legal Proceedings).
      In
      addition, the Company recorded a substantial expense in 2003 related to the
      funding of losses of Sonesta Hotel   Suites, Coconut Grove. A more detailed
      discussion of the changes in income by hotel, as well as for the Company s
      management activities, follows. 

      Sonesta
      Beach Resort Key Biscayne reported 2004 operating income of $1,553,000 compared
      to $386,000 in 2003, an increase of $1,167,000. Revenues increased by
      $1,583,000, and expenses increased by $416,000 compared to 2003, representing
      a
      2% increase in total expenses. This increase was primarily due to higher cost
      and operating expenses and real estate taxes, partially offset by lower
      administrative and general, maintenance and depreciation expenses. Operating
      income in 2004 at Royal Sonesta Hotel Boston (Cambridge) was $1,450,000,
      compared to operating income of $189,000 during 2003, an increase of $1,261,000.
      Total revenues during 2004 increased by $1,657,000, and total expenses increased
      by $396,000 compared to 2003. The $396,000 increase in expenses, a 2% increase,
      was primarily due to higher cost and operating expenses (due to higher occupancy
      levels), advertising costs and human resource expenses, which were partially
      offset by lower real estate taxes and depreciation expense. Operating income
      at
      Royal Sonesta Hotel New Orleans decreased from $2,994,000 during 2003 to
      $1,323,000 during 2004, despite an increase in revenues in 2004 of $841,000.
      Total expenses in 2004 increased by $2,512,000, which was primarily due to
      an
      increase of $1,412,000 in rent expense. The increase in rent is entirely due
      to
      the fact that the hotel s 2004 capital expenditures were sharply lower compared
      to capital expenditures in 2003, as the hotel has completed the majority of
      its
      renovation programs. Since capital expenditures are deducted from profits for
      purposes of calculating rent due under the lease for the hotel, rent expense
      actually increases when the hotel s capital expenditures decrease. The remaining
      increase in expenses of $1,100,000 in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due
      to
      higher cost and operating expenses, administrative and general expense, real
      estate taxes and depreciation expense. Repairs and maintenance costs decreased.
      Operating loss from management activities, which is computed after giving effect
      to management and marketing fees from owned and leased hotels, decreased by
      $1,936,000, from $4,760,000 during 2003 to $2,824,000 during 2004. Revenues
      from
      management activities increased by $930,000, and expenses related to these
      activities decreased by $1,006,000. The Company recorded expenses of $54,000
      and
      $800,000 in 2004 and 2003, respectively, for net operating losses and minimum
      owners return payments related to Sonesta Hotel   Suites Coconut Grove.
      Under its management agreement for the hotel, the Company is obligated to fund
      these amounts. The Company recorded expenses of $281,000 and $847,000 in 2004
      and 2003, respectively, related to costs and expenses incurred with regards
      to
      the arbitration of a dispute with the owner of a managed hotel (see Note 9,
      Legal Proceedings). The decrease in corporate expenses as a result of the above
      two non-recurring items were partially offset by an increase in corporate costs,
      primarily related to the increased expense of providing employee benefits,
      including pension and health insurance benefits. 

Other
      Income and Deductions  

Interest
      expense decreased by $2,284,000 during 2005 compared to 2004. This was due
      to
      the repayment of the mortgage loan on Sonesta Beach Resort Key Biscayne, and
      the
      reduction of the principal balance of the mortgage loan on Royal Sonesta Hotel
      Boston (Cambridge) in April 2005 (see also Note 2 - Operations and Note 4 -
      Borrowing Arrangements). Interest expense increased by $55,000 in 2004 compared
      to 2003 due to expenses incurred related to the restructuring of the Company s
      mortgage debt on Royal Sonesta Hotel Boston (Cambridge) and Sonesta Beach Resort
      Key Biscayne (see Note 4 - Borrowing Arrangements). 

5 

Interest
      income increased from $389,000 in 2004 to $1,129,000 in 2005, primarily due
      to
      an increase in short-term investment income on the Company s cash balances. In
      April 2005, the Company received net cash of approximately $24.4 million
      following the transfer of the land and improvements of Sonesta Beach Resort
      Key
      Biscayne to a partnership in which the Company is a 50% limited partner (see
      Note 2 - Operations).   Interest
      income increased by $31,000 in 2004 compared to 2003 mainly due to increased
      income recorded on the Company s loans to the owner of Sonesta Hotel  
      Suites Coconut Grove (see Note 3 - Long-Term Receivables and Advances).

The
      2005
      gain on sale of $4,082,000 includes a $3,950,000 gain on the sale of land the
      Company had owned since 1995 in Costa Rica. The site was intended for a new
      resort to be operated by the Company, but the development never materialized.
      The remaining gain in 2005 resulted primarily from the sale of a non-essential
      asset in Tuscany, Italy. The 2003 gain on sale of assets of $652,000 resulted
      primarily from the sale of a villa which the Company owned and operated adjacent
      to the Sonesta Beach Resort Key Biscayne. 

Federal,
      State and Foreign Income Taxes  

The
      Company recorded a net tax benefit of $5,355,000 during 2005, despite its
      pre-tax loss of $687,000, primarily as a result of the following: 

During
                2003 and 2004, the Company recorded valuation allowances totaling
                $3,862,000 against the federal income tax benefits on its pre-tax
                losses
                of approximately $10.6 million incurred during these two years, since
                it
                was uncertain if the Company could realize a future benefit for these
                losses. In addition, valuation allowances of $296,000 were recorded
                against Florida state tax loss carry forwards, for the same reason.
                In
                April 2005, the Company completed the transfer of the land and
                improvements of Sonesta Beach Resort Key Biscayne (see Note 2 -
                Operations). This transaction resulted in significant taxable income,
                and
                the Company therefore reversed in 2005 the valuation allowances previously
                recorded, since it will receive a benefit in 2005 for the prior years 
                losses. 

In
                2005, a foreign subsidiary of the Company sold land it had owned
                in Costa
                Rica, and recorded a pre-tax gain of $3,950,000. The foreign subsidiary
                remitted the proceeds to the parent company, and in accordance with
                IRS
                Code Section 965(a) of the American Job Creations Act of 2004, the
                Company
                was able to receive a  temporary dividends received deduction  of
                approximately $3.1 million, resulting in tax savings of approximately
                $1.1
                million. 

In
      2004
      and 2003, the Company recorded tax expense of $426,000 and $34,000,
      respectively, despite its pre-tax losses of approximately $4.2 million in 2004
      and $6.4 million in 2003. Valuation allowances were recorded against the 2004
      and 2003 federal income tax benefits since it was uncertain during these years
      if the Company would realize a future benefit for the losses incurred. The
      Company provided for state taxes on its income from Royal Sonesta Hotel New
      Orleans, and foreign taxes primarily on the Company s management income from its
      Egyptian operations. In 2003 this provision for state and foreign taxes was
      reduced by the reversal of a general provision for federal taxes which carried
      forward from previous years.  

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources  

The
      Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $25 million at December
      31, 2005.  

In
      April
      2005 the Company received net cash of approximately $24.4 million related to
      the
      transfer of the land and improvements of the Sonesta Beach Resort Key Biscayne
      to a partnership in which the Company is a 50% limited partner. In connection
      with the same transaction, a $29,967,000 mortgage loan secured by the assets
      of
      Sonesta Beach Resort Key Biscayne was repaid, and the Company paid $5,572,000
      which reduced the principal balance of the Royal Sonesta Hotel Boston
      (Cambridge) loan to $34,061,000. Federal and state income tax payments of
      $6,732,000 made during 2005 include taxes due on the taxable income from the
      transfer of the Sonesta Beach Resort Key Biscayne assets. The total proceeds
      received, net of expenses, totaling $59,728,000, were recorded as a finance
      obligation on the balance sheet, since the transfer did not qualify for
      recognition as a sale. 

In
      September 2005 the Company sold land it owned in Costa Rica for $4.5 million,
      and reported a $3,950,000 pre-tax gain after deducting the $450,000 book value
      of the land and related expenses. 

In
      June
      2005 the Company paid a special dividend of $1.00 per share for a total amount
      of $3,698,000. In addition, a dividend of $0.10 was declared in December 2005,
      but was paid in January 2006. 

The
      Company contributed $2,188,000 and $1,203,000 to its Pension Plan in 2005 and
      2003, respectively. No contribution was made in 2004. 

Chateau
      Sonesta Hotel New Orleans, which the Company operates under a long-term
      management agreement, was closed from August 29 to November 30, 2005 due to
      damages sustained from Hurricane Katrina. The hotel s owner has notified the
      Company that it will only pay for losses sustained during the period the hotel
      was closed, and for repairs, to the extent of available insurance proceeds.
      As a
      result, the Company advanced $1,025,000 at December 31, 2005, primarily for
      the
      payment of ongoing expenses of the hotel operation. The Company is entitled
      to
      recover these advances, including interest, out of first available income from
      the hotel based on the terms of its management agreement. In addition, the
      Company has committed to advance approximately $2.1 million for repairs, which
      will be repaid from either insurance proceeds or from future income from
      operations. The Company has been in discussions with the hotel s owner regarding
      a possible acquisition of the hotel by the Company, but has not been able to
      reach an agreement. 

The
      Company operates the Sonesta Hotel   Suites Coconut Grove, Miami, which is a
      condominium hotel that opened in April 2002. Under its agreements, the Company
      is committed to fund net operating losses, and to provide the hotel s owner with
      a minimum annual return of $500,000, adjusted annually by increases in the
      Consumer Price Index, starting January 1, 2004. Starting in 2005, the management
      agreement can be terminated by the hotel s owner if the Company fails to cure
      shortfalls against a minimum target return of $1,000,000, adjusted annually
      by
      increases in the CPI. From April 2002 through December 2004, the Company
      contributed and expensed $1,804,000 for shortfalls against the minimum owners
      return. In addition, included in 2005 is a $263,000 expense recorded to cure
      a
      shortfall in achieving the minimum target return for the calendar year 2005.
      The
      hotel s owner will have the right to cancel the management agreement, if the
      Company, once it has been notified, declines to cure the 2005 shortfall. The
      hotel s owner and the Company have agreed to postpone the notice period until
      April 15, 2006, and will attempt to negotiate a mutually acceptable
      restructuring of the management agreement before then. The Company expects
      to
      achieve the target return for 2006.

The
      Company operates the Trump International Sonesta Beach Resort, a condominium
      hotel in Sunny Isles, Florida. This hotel opened in April 2003. The Company
      contributed to the cost of the hotel s non-guestroom furniture, fixtures and
      equipment ( FF E ), and has recorded an investment of $2,250,000 at December
      31, 2005 for same. The Company also guarantees an equipment lease in the
      original amount of $1,000,000. Additionally, the Company advanced $2,328,000
      for
      pre-opening expenses, which amount was repaid in January 2006. Under the
      management agreement, the Company is obligated to fund 50% of the hotel s losses
      from the opening through November 1, 2004. After this date, the Company is
      obligated to pay the owner a minimum annual return of $800,000. The Company
      advanced $1,391,000 for losses through November 1, 2004, which amount is
      included in long-term receivables and advances. This amount will be repaid
      from
      profits in excess of the minimum return, or will be settled if the Company
      closes on a purchase option it has under the management agreement (see Note
      9 -
      Legal Proceedings). In 2005, the Company recorded an expense of $393,000 for
      a
      shortfall incurred against the minimum return during the period November 1,
      2004
      through December 31, 2005. Based on its business plan for the hotel, the Company
      does not expect to fund any shortfalls in 2006. 

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, the Company s fixed contractual obligations were as
      follows: 

The
      Company s hotels also have certain purchase obligations, primarily for
      maintenance and service contracts. These are not included in the contractual
      obligations since the amounts committed are not material, and because the
      majority of these contracts may be terminated on relatively short
      notice. 

Company
      management believes that its present cash balances will be more than adequate
      to
      meet its cash requirements for 2006 and for the foreseeable future  . 

Critical
      Accounting Policies and Estimates  

The
      consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
      principles generally accepted in the United States, which require the Company
      to
      make estimates and assumptions. The Company believes that of its significant
      accounting policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgment
      and
      complexity. 

Revenue
                recognition - a substantial portion of our revenues result from the
                operations of our owned and leased hotels. These revenues are recognized
                at the time that lodging and other hotel services are provided to
                our
                guests. Certain revenues, principally those relating to groups using
                lodging and banquet facilities, are billed directly to the customers.
                These revenues are subject to credit risk, which the Company manages
                by
                establishing allowances for uncollectible accounts. If management
                establishes allowances for uncollectible accounts that are insufficient,
                it will overstate income, and this will result in increases in allowances
                for uncollectible accounts in future
                periods. 

Management,
      license and service fees represents fee income from hotels operated under
      management agreements, and license fees from hotels to which the Company has
      licensed the use of the  Sonesta  name. Management fees include base fees and
      marketing fees, which are generally based on a percentage of gross revenues,
      and
      incentive fees, which are generally based on the hotels  profitability. These
      fees are typically based on revenues and income achieved during each calendar
      year. Incentive fees are recognized throughout the year on a quarterly basis
      based on profits achieved during the interim periods when our agreements provide
      for quarterly payments during the calendar years they are earned, and when
      such
      incentive fee income would be due if the management agreements were terminated.
      As a result, during quarterly periods, fee income may not be indicative of
      eventual income recognized at the end of each calendar year due to changes
      in
      business conditions and profitability. License fees are earned based on a
      percentage of room revenues of the hotels.

Impairment
                of long lived assets - the Company monitors the carrying value of
                its
                owned properties from the perspective of accounting rules relating
                to
                impairment. A requirement to assess impairment would be triggered
                by so
                called  impairment indicators . For us, these might include low rates of
                occupancy, operating costs in excess of revenues, or maturing mortgages
                for which there were no suitable refinancing options. Impairment
                also
                needs to be considered with respect to costs incurred for new hotel
                investments or development opportunities that are under study. The
                Company
                monitors these costs on a quarterly basis and if a pending project
                is no
                longer considered to be viable, the cost is charged against income.
                If the
                Company estimates incorrectly or misjudges the impairment indicators,
                it
                may result in the Company failing to record an impairment charge,
                or
                recording a charge which may be
                inaccurate. 

Pension
                Benefits - the Company continues to maintain a defined benefit plan
                for
                eligible employees. Costs and liabilities are developed from actuarial
                valuations. In these valuations are assumptions relating to discount
                rates, expected return on assets, employee turnover, and future wage
                increases. Differences between assumed amounts and actual performance
                will
                impact reported amounts for the Company s pension expense, as well as the
                liability for future pension
                benefits. 

Sonesta
                Hotel   Suites Coconut Grove - the Company operates a condominium
                hotel under a management agreement, under which it is committed to
                fund
                net operating losses, and provide the owner with minimum annual returns
                of
                $500,000, adjusted annually by increases in the Consumer Price Index,
                beginning as of January 1, 2004. In addition, the management agreement
                may
                be subject to termination if the Company elects not to cure shortfalls
                against a minimum target return of $1,000,000, adjusted annually
                by
                increases in the Consumer Price Index, starting January 1, 2005.
                Under its
                agreements, the Company is entitled to management and marketing fees
                based
                on revenues, and incentive fees based on profits. In case the
                aforementioned annual minimum returns and minimum target returns
                are not
                met, the Company s policy is to eliminate management and marketing fees
                from its revenues. If the amount of the shortfall exceeds the fee
                income,
                the Company will book the additional amount as an administrative
                and
                general expense. Amounts advanced for seasonal losses and for working
                capital (which the Company is obligated to provide) are included
                in
                current assets on the Company s balance sheets.

Trump
                International Sonesta Beach Resort - the Company operates a condominium
                hotel in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida, which opened in April 2003.
                Under the
                management agreement, the Company is entitled to management and marketing
                fees based on the hotel s revenues, and incentive fees based on the
                hotel s net operating income. The Company is obligated to advance funds
                to
                provide a minimum annual return of $800,000 to the hotel s owner, starting
                as of November 1, 2004. From the opening in April 2003 until November
                1,
                2004, the Company was obligated to advance 50% of any net operating
                losses. Amounts advanced under these obligations are subject to repayment,
                without interest, out of future profits in excess of the aforementioned
                minimum return. If the minimum returns are not earned, the Company
                will
                eliminate the fee income earned from the property from its revenues.
                If
                the amounts of the shortfalls exceed the total fee income, the Company
                will reflect such excess amounts either as long-term receivables
                and
                advances on its balance sheet, or will record an expense equal to
                the
                amount advanced. The Company has invested in the furniture, fixtures
                and
                equipment of the non-guestroom areas of the hotel, an amount of
                $2,250,000. This is recorded as an other long-term asset, and is
                being
                amortized over the 10-year initial term of the management agreement.
                Management continually assesses the realizability of its long-term
                assets
                and receivables and has concluded there is no impairment at December
                31,
                2005. 

Accounting
                for 2005 Asset Transfer - in April 2005, the Company completed the
                transfer of the land and improvements of Sonesta Beach Key Biscayne
                to a
                development partnership, of which the Company is a 50% partner. At
                that
                time, the Company received non-refundable proceeds of approximately
                $60
                million, and is entitled to a priority return of an additional $60
                million
                from the sale of condominium units in a new condominium resort to
                be
                constructed on the site. Based on the book value of the land and
                improvements ($31,700,000 at December 31, 2005) this transaction
                will
                result in a substantial gain. Since the Company will continue to
                operate
                the existing hotel until August 2006, and will have a continuing
                involvement in the ownership and operation of the new resort to be
                constructed, this gain will be deferred. A comprehensive description
                of
                this transaction, as well as an outline of the current and future
                accounting, is included in Note 2 -
                Operations. 

Quantitative
      and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risk  

The
      Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. The Company
      uses fixed rate debt to finance the ownership of its properties. The table
      that
      follows summarizes the Company s fixed rate debt obligations outstanding at
      December 31, 2005. This information should be read in conjunction with Note
      4

Selected
      Quarterly Financial Data  

Selected
      quarterly financial information for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004
      is as follows: 

Fourth
      Quarter Results  

Revenues
      during the fourth quarter of 2005 were $20,872,000 compared to $23,216,000
      during the same quarter in 2004, a decrease of $2,344,000. Of this decrease,
      $1,122,000 was attributable to Royal Sonesta Hotel New Orleans. After Hurricane
      Katrina, food and beverage revenues were sharply lower since not all of the
      hotel s food and beverage outlets were in operation. Revenues in the 2005 fourth
      quarter at Sonesta Beach Resort Key Biscayne were $5,889,000, a $901,000
      decrease compared to the same period in 2004. Hurricane Wilma caused the resort
      to close for a week in early October 2005. Revenues from management activities
      were $765,000 lower during the 2005 fourth quarter compared to 2004. This was
      mainly due to a $285,000 decrease in management income from Chateau Sonesta
      Hotel New Orleans, which hotel was closed from August 29 through November 30,
      2005 to repair damage sustained from Hurricane Katrina. Management income from
      Sonesta Hotel   Suites Coconut Grove decreased by $299,000 in the 2005
      fourth quarter compared to a year ago. In 2005, the Company did not achieve
      a
      minimum target return as provided for in the management agreement for this
      hotel. 

In
      the
      2005 fourth quarter the Company recorded an operating loss of $1,983,000,
      compared to operating income of $1,083,000 during the 2004 fourth quarter,
      a
      decrease of $3,066,000. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in income
      of $1,904,000 at Sonesta Beach Resort Key Biscayne, and an increase of
      $1,601,000 in operating losses from management activities. Operating income
      increased by $267,000 at Royal Sonesta Hotel Boston (Cambridge) and by $172,000
      at Royal Sonesta Hotel New Orleans. At Sonesta Beach Resort Key Biscayne,
      revenues declined $901,000 in the 2005 fourth quarter compared to 2004, while
      expenses increased by $1,003,000, mainly due to increased costs and operating,
      maintenance and real estate tax expenses, as well as a $675,000 additional
      depreciation charge recorded in the 2005 fourth quarter. The additional
      depreciation expense resulted from the adjustment of the useful lives of certain
      furniture and equipment used in connection with the operations of the hotel,
      which is scheduled to cease operations in August 2006 (see Note 2 - Operations).
      Operating losses from management activities increased by $1,601,000 during
      the
      2005 fourth quarter compared to the same period in 2004. Revenues decreased
      by
      $765,000, and expenses increased by $836,000. The increase in expenses was
      in
      part due to an expense recorded in the 2005 fourth quarter of $393,000 resulting
      from a shortfall in achieving the minimum owners  return which the Company is
      committed to under its management agreement for Trump International Sonesta
      Beach Resort Sunny Isles. In addition, included in the 2005 fourth quarter
      is a
      $263,000 expense, since the Company may have to, after notice from the hotel s
      owner, cure a shortfall in achieving a performance threshold for the calendar
      year 2005 under the management agreement for Sonesta Hotel   Suites Coconut
      Grove. The hotel s owner will obtain the right to cancel the management
      agreement, if the Company, once it has been notified, declines to cure the
      2005
      shortfall. The hotel s owner and the Company have agreed to postpone the notice
      period until April 15, 2006, and will attempt to negotiate a mutually acceptable
      restructuring of the management agreement before then. The remaining increase
      in
      expenses of $180,000 was primarily due to increased corporate sales and
      marketing expenses.

NOTES
      TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

1.       Basis
      of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies  

Basis
      of Presentation:  

Sonesta
      International Hotels Corporation (the Company) is engaged in the operation
      of
      hotels in Boston (Cambridge), Massachusetts; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Key
      Biscayne, Florida. The Company also operates, under management agreements,
      hotels in Bermuda (until May 2004); Coconut Grove and Sunny Isles (Miami),
      Florida; New Orleans, Louisiana; and in Cairo, Sharm El Sheikh, Luxor, Taba,
      and
      Port Said, Egypt. The Company also manages three Nile River cruise ships in
      Egypt. Sonesta has granted licenses, for which it receives fees, for the use
      of
      its name for hotels in St. Maarten, Peru and Brazil. 

Principles
      of Consolidation:  

The
      consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
      wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
      transactions have been eliminated. 

Operations:  

The
      consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of wholly
      owned and leased properties, and fee income from managed and licensed
      properties.  

Foreign
      Currency Transactions:  

Assets
      and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are converted at end of year
      rates, and income and expense items are converted at weighted average rates
      during the period. The net result of such conversions is charged or credited
      to
      the statement of operations. 

Inventories:  

Merchandise
      and supplies are stated at the lower of cost (first-in/first-out method) or
      market. 

Revenue
      Recognition:  

The
      Company s revenues are primarily derived from (1) owned and leased hotels and
      (2) management, license and service fees. 

Owned
                and leased hotels - The majority of the Company s income is derived from
                its owned and leased hotels, from the rental of rooms, food and beverage
                sales as well as charges for parking, telephone and other incidental
                charges. These revenues are recognized when rooms are occupied and
                services have been rendered. 

Management,
                license and service fees - Represents fee income from hotels operated
                under management agreements, and license fees from hotels to which
                the
                Company has licensed the use of the  Sonesta  name. Management fees
                include base fees and marketing fees, which are generally based on
                a
                percentage of gross revenues, and incentive fees, which are generally
                based on the hotels  profitability. These fees are typically based on
                revenues and income achieved during each calendar year. Incentive
                fees are
                recognized throughout the year on a quarterly basis based on profits
                achieved during the interim periods when our agreements provide for
                quarterly payments during the calendar years they are earned, and
                when
                such incentive fee income would be due if the management agreements
                were
                terminated. As a result, during quarterly periods, fee income may
                not be
                indicative of eventual income recognized at the end of each calendar
                year
                due to changes in business conditions and profitability. License
                fees are
                earned based on a percentage of room revenues of the hotels. Revenues
                and
                expenses of hotels operated under management agreements are excluded
                from
                the Company s consolidated statement of
                operations. 

Advertising:  

The
      cost
      of advertising is generally expensed as incurred. 

Property
      and Equipment:  

Property
      and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization of items of
      property and equipment are computed generally on the straight-line method based
      on the following estimated useful lives: 

Buildings: 

Owned
                  properties 

20
                  to 40 years 

Furniture
                  and equipment 

Located
                  in owned properties 

5
                  to 10 years 

Located
                  in leased properties  

5
                  to 10 years or remaining lease terms 

Leasehold
                  improvements: 

Remaining
                  lease terms 

Impairment
      of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
      of:  

The
      carrying values of long-lived assets, which include property and equipment
      and
      intangibles, are evaluated periodically for impairment when impairment
      indicators are present. Future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying assets
      are compared to the assets  carrying values. Adjustments to fair value are made
      if the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than book value.
      To date, no adjustments for impairment have been made. 

Income
      Taxes:  

We
      provide for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,  Accounting for Income
      Taxes . The Company and its United States subsidiaries file a consolidated
      federal income tax return. Federal and foreign income taxes are provided on
      earnings of foreign subsidiaries. 

Fair
      Value of Financial Instruments:   

The
      Company's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
      and notes receivable, accounts payable and long-term debt. With the exception
      of
      its long-term debt, the Company believes that the carrying value of its
      financial instruments approximates their fair values. The book balance at
      December 31, 2005 of the Company s long-term debt, which carries an interest
      rate of 8.6%, is $34,061,000. The Company estimates the fair value of this
      debt
      at approximately $     36,288,000,
      based on current prevailing interest rates for similar mortgage
      debt. 

Impact
      of Recently Issued Accounting Standards:  

In
      the
      first quarter of 2004, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
      ( FASB ) interpretation No. 46 (R),  Consolidation of Variable Interest
      Entities  ( Interpretation 46 ) which clarified the conditions under which
      assets, liabilities and activities of another entity should be consolidated
      into
      the financial statements of a company. Interpretation 46 requires the
      consolidation of a variable interest entity by a company that bears the majority
      of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities, is entitled
      to receive a majority of the variable interest entity s residual returns, or
      both. Management believes the management agreements with Trump International
      Sonesta Beach Resort Sunny Isles and Sonesta Hotel and Suites Coconut Grove
      are
      variable interests. The Company does not believe it bears the majority of the
      risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to
      receive the majority of the variable interest entity s residual returns.
      Accordingly, the adoption of Interpretation 46 did not have a material impact
      on
      the Company s overall financial position and results of operations. 

FASB
      Statement No. 123 (Revised 2004),    Share-Based
      Payment    (SFAS
      123R) was issued in December, 2004. SFAS 123R replaces SFAS No. 123,
   Accounting
      for Stock-Based Compensation   
      (SFAS
      123), and supercedes APB Opinion No. 25,    Accounting
      for Stock Issued to Employees   .
      SFAS
      123R requires companies to recognize the compensation cost related to
      share-based payment transactions with employees in the financial statements.
      Since the Company has no share based compensation plans of any kind, the
      adoption of SFAS 123R in 2006 is not expected to affect the Company s overall
      financial position and results of operations.  

15 

The
      Company adopted FASB Statement No. 132,  Employers  Disclosures about Pensions
      and Other Post-retirement Benefits , which was issued in December 2003.
      Statement 132 revises employer s disclosures about pension plans and other
      post-retirement benefit plans, and requires additional disclosures about the
      assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit costs of defined
      benefit pension plans and other defined post-retirement benefit plans.

Use
      of Estimates:  

The
      preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
      generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
      and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements
      and
      accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
      estimates. 

Reclassification:  

Certain
      amounts in the 2003 and 2004 financial statements have been reclassified to
      conform to the 2005 presentation. 

Statement
      of Cash Flows   : 

Cash
      and
      cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and short-term, highly liquid
      investments with original maturities of less than 90 days, which are readily
      convertible into cash. 

Cash
      paid
      for interest in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was approximately $3,430,000, $5,647,000
      and
      $6,136,000, respectively. Cash paid for income taxes in 2005 and 2004 was
      approximately $6,732,000 and $224,000, respectively. Net cash refunded for
      income taxes in 2003 was approximately $1,384,000.  

2.       Operations  

Sonesta
      Beach Resort Key Biscayne  

On
      April
      19, 2005, Sonesta Beach Resort Limited Partnership ( SBRLP ), a wholly owned
      subsidiary of Sonesta International Hotels Corporation ( Sonesta ), completed
      the transfer of the land and improvements of Sonesta Beach Resort, in Key
      Biscayne, Florida to a partnership between SBRLP and affiliates of Fortune
      International, a Miami-based real estate development and brokerage firm
      ( Fortune ). SBRLP is a 50% limited partner in the new partnership, and
      affiliates of Fortune are the general partner and a limited partner, together
      owning a 50% interest in the partnership. The new partnership, SBR-Fortune
      Associates, LLLP ( SBR-Fortune ), expects that the existing hotel will remain in
      operation through August 2006. It will subsequently be demolished to start
      construction of a new resort, which will include a luxury condominium hotel
      and
      residential condominium units, restaurants, meeting/function space, a spa and
      other facilities customary to the finest resorts in South Florida. 

In
      connection with the closing on April 19, 2005, of the transfer of the land
      and
      improvements, Sonesta received $30,011,000 in cash, and, in addition, an
      existing mortgage of $29,967,000 on the property was paid off by SBR-Fortune.
      Sonesta also received an equity position in SBR-Fortune valued at approximately
      $60 million. This value will be paid to Sonesta out of the first available
      net
      proceeds from the sale of condominium units, after repayment of (construction)
      debt. Thereafter, Fortune will receive its initial $30 million equity
      contribution, plus any additional equity contributions it was required to make
      to develop the new resort. Subsequent to Fortune fully recovering its
      investment, profits will be split equally. Sonesta is not required to fund
      any
      additional equity beyond the contribution of the land and improvements. Fortune
      will have the sole responsibility for arranging financing and completing
      construction of the new resort. 

As
      of
      April 19, 2005, Sonesta continues to operate the hotel under a token ($1 per
      year) lease with SBR-Fortune. Currently, the hotel is scheduled to close in
      August 2006. Sonesta will receive all operating profits during this period.
      Sonesta does have the right to cease operations of the existing hotel on 60
      days
      notice, in case revenues are insufficient to cover all expenses. 

Once
      the
      new condominium hotel is completed, the non-guestroom areas of the hotel, which
      include restaurants, bars, meeting space, office and storage facilities, etc.,
      (the  Hotel Lot ) will be transferred to a newly formed partnership, of which
      Sonesta is a 70% partner and general partner, and Fortune is a 30% limited
      partner. Sonesta will operate the Hotel Lot, and will offer a rental program
      to
      the buyers of condo units that wish to make their units available for rental
      to
      the public. 

The
      cost
      of closing the existing hotel, including severance payments to employees,
      funding of vacation pay, pension obligations and other costs, will be paid
      by
      SBR-Fortune, up to a maximum of $4 million. The Company believes this will
      be
      sufficient to cover these costs. 

The
      Company has accounted for the transaction at December 31, 2005 as
      follows: 

1. 

In
                accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
                No. 66
                 Accounting for Sales of Real Estate , the Company has deferred all gain
                recognition on the property transfer due to its continuing involvement
                as
                owner in the development partnership, and as owner and manager of
                the new
                condominium hotel. Until such time that the existing Hotel ceases
                operations, the Company has recognized the cash received and the
                debt
                which was repaid as a finance obligation.

2. 

Since
                the Company continues to operate the existing Hotel, all the Hotel s
                assets remain included in fixed assets (with a net book value at
                December
                31, 2005 of $35,942,000) and continue to be depreciated. The Company
                has
                adjusted the useful lives of certain furniture and equipment which
                was not
                included in the transfer of assets, and is recognizing additional
                depreciation expense (amounting to approximately $675,000 in 2005),
                to
                fully depreciate these assets by August 2006. All revenues and continuing
                expenses of the hotel operations are included in the statement of
                operations. 

3. 

For
                federal and state income tax purposes, the Company will report a
                taxable
                gain in 2005 of approximately $29.6 million on this transaction,
                but will
                have the benefit from the utilization of loss carryforwards from
                2003 and
                2004 of approximately $10.6 million. Federal and state taxes paid
                on the
                taxable gain are recorded as deferred tax
                assets 

Going
      forward the accounting for this transaction will be as follows: 

1.    
             
                During
                the accounting period that the existing hotel expects to cease operations,
                currently planned to be the third quarter of 2006, the Company will
                remove
                the existing hotel s assets from its balance sheet, and will record an
                investment for its 50% equity ownership in the developing partnership.
                This investment will be based on 50% of the estimated fair value
                of the
                assets transferred plus 50% of the remaining book value of the assets
                at
                that time, reduced by the proceeds received in April 2005. The estimated
                fair value of the assets is $160 million, based on a valuation of
                the
                highest and best use of the land by a nationally recognized real
                estate
                firm. The book value of the land and improvements were approximately
                $31.7
                million at December 31, 2005. 

16 

2.    
             
                Due
                to the continuing involvement by the Company by virtue of its ownership
                in
                the new condominium hotel, and the management of the rental program
                that
                will be offered to purchasers of condominium units, the gain on the
                transfer of the assets will be deferred. Additional proceeds from
                the
                development of the new condominium hotel will first reduce the investment
                account, and future proceeds in excess of the investment account
                will be
                added to the deferred gain. 

3.    
             
                Once
                the new condominium hotel commences operations, the deferred gain
                will be
                amortized over a 30 year period, which coincides with the estimated
                useful
                life of the new building. 

Other  

During
      2005 the Company sold land it owned in Costa Rica for $4.5 million, and reported
      a $3,950,000 pre-tax gain after deducting the $450,000 book value of the land
      and related expenses. The Company had owned the site since 1995. It was
      originally intended for a new resort, but the development never
      materialized. 

The
      Company operates the Sonesta Hotel   Suites Coconut Grove, Miami, which is a
      condominium hotel that opened in April 2002. Under its agreements, the Company
      is committed to fund net operating losses, and to provide the hotel s owner with
      a minimum annual return of $500,000, adjusted annually by increases in the
      Consumer Price Index, starting January 1, 2004. Starting in 2005, the management
      agreement can be terminated by the hotel s owner if the Company fails to cure
      shortfalls against a minimum target return of $1,000,000, adjusted annually
      by
      increases in the CPI. From April 2002 through December 2004, the Company
      contributed and expensed $1,804,000 for shortfalls against the minimum owners
      return. In addition, included in 2005 is a $263,000 expense recorded to cure
      a
      shortfall in achieving the minimum target return for the calendar year 2005.
      The
      hotel s owner will have the right to cancel the management agreement, if the
      Company, once it has been notified, declines to cure the 2005 shortfall. The
      hotel s owner and the Company have agreed to postpone the notice period until
      April 15, 2006, and will attempt to negotiate a mutually acceptable
      restructuring of the management agreement before then. The Company expects
      to
      achieve the target return for 2006.  

The
      Company operates the Trump International Sonesta Beach Resort, a condominium
      hotel in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. This hotel opened in April 2003. The
      Company contributed to the cost for the hotel s non-guestroom furniture,
      fixtures and equipment ( FF E ), and has recorded an investment of
      $2,250,000 at December 31, 2005 for same. The Company also guarantees an
      equipment lease in the original amount of $1,000,000. Additionally, the Company
      advanced $2,328,000 for pre-opening expenses, which amount was repaid in January
      2006. Under the management agreement, the Company is obligated to fund 50%
      of
      the hotel s losses from the opening through November 1, 2004. After this date,
      the Company is obligated to pay the owner a minimum annual return of $800,000.
      The Company advanced $1,391,000 for losses through November 1, 2004, which
      amount is included in long-term receivables and advances. This amount will
      be
      repaid from profits in excess of the minimum return, or will be settled if
      the
      Company closes on a purchase option it has under the management agreement (see
      Note 9 - Legal Proceedings). In 2005, the Company recorded an expense of
      $393,000 for a shortfall incurred against the minimum return during the period
      November 1, 2004 through December 31, 2005. Based on its business plan for
      the
      hotel, the Company does not expect to fund any shortfalls in 2006, and it
      expects to fully recover all amounts advanced in the future. 

Chateau
      Sonesta Hotel New Orleans, which the Company operates under a long-term
      management agreement, was closed from August 29 to November 30, 2005 due to
      damages sustained from Hurricane Katrina. The hotel s owner has notified the
      Company that it will only pay for losses sustained during the period the hotel
      was closed, and for repairs, to the extent of available insurance proceeds.
      As a
      result, the Company has advanced $1,025,000 at December 31, 2005, primarily
      for
      the payment of ongoing expenses of the hotel operation. The Company is entitled
      to recover these advances, including interest, out of first available income
      from the hotel, based on the terms of its management agreement. In addition,
      the
      Company has committed to advance approximately $2.1 million for repairs, which
      will be repaid from either insurance proceeds or from income from operations.
      The Company has been in discussions with the hotel s owner regarding a possible
      acquisition of the hotel by the Company, but no agreements have been
      reached. 

The
      Company s receivables for fees and reimbursable expenses from Sonesta Beach
      Resort and Sonesta Club Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt totaled approximately $1.6
      million at December 31, 2005, and are included in Accounts Receivables-Trade.
      Management believes these amounts will be fully realizable from income generated
      by these hotels, which are operated under long-term management
      agreements. 

The
      Company reached agreements with its lender to restructure its mortgage debt
      on
      Royal Sonesta Hotel Boston (Cambridge) (see Note 4 - Borrowing Arrangements).
      The restructuring provided for lower interest payments, and the deferral of
      principal payments, starting January 1, 2004.  

The
      Company terminated a license agreement for the use of its name for four small
      properties in Tuscany, Italy in early 2005. 

During
      2004, the Company started operating Sonesta Beach Resort Taba, in Egypt, under
      a
      management agreement. Also during 2004, the Company granted licenses for the
      use
      of its name to hotels in St. Maarten and Sao Paulo, Brazil. 

Gross
      revenues for hotels operated by the Company under management contracts, by
      geographic area, for the three years ended December 31, 2005, are summarized
      below: 

Costs
      and
      operating expenses for owned and leased hotels for the three years ended
      December 31, 2005 are summarized below:    

Direct
      departmental costs include payroll expense and related payroll burden, the
      cost
      of food and beverage consumed and other departmental costs. 

17 

The
      Company experienced losses in the years 2001 through 2004, and an operating
      loss
      in 2005, as a result of declines in business and leisure travel since September
      2001. In 2005, the Company recorded a net profit, aided by a gain on sale of
      assets, and a reduction in interest expense following the repayment of the
      mortgage loan on Sonesta Beach Resort Key Biscayne as part of a transaction
      to
      redevelop the hotel site. This transaction also provided the Company with
      substantial cash resources, which will be sufficient for the Company to meet
      its
      working capital needs, operating expenses, rent and capital expenditures in
      the
      normal course of its business for the foreseeable future.  

3.     
             
                 Long-Term
                Receivables and Advances  

(b)    
             
                This
                loan was made to the owner of the Sonesta Hotel   Suites Coconut
                Grove, Miami, which opened in April 2002. The Company has loaned
                $4,000,000 to fund construction and furniture, fixtures and equipment
                ( FF E ) costs, and, in addition, has loaned $1,000,000 for
                pre-opening costs and working capital. The loan for construction
                and
                FF E costs bears interest at the prime rate (7.25% at December 31,
                2005) plus 0.75%. No interest was charged on the loan for pre-opening
                costs, which was fully repaid at December 31, 2005. The loan is secured
                by
                a mortgage on the hotel property and is being repaid out of hotel
                profits
                that are available for distribution to the owner, and, to the extent
                the
                hotel s earnings are insufficient to pay the owner certain minimum annual
                returns and minimum annual target returns due under the management
                agreement, out of shortfalls funded by the
                Company. 

(c)    
             
                This
                amount represents advances made to the owner of Trump International
                Sonesta Beach Resort Sunny Isles for pre-opening costs ($2,328,000)
                and
                for the Company s share of the losses of the resort from the opening in
                April 2003 through October 31, 2004 ($1,391,000). The advance for
                pre-opening expenses was repaid in January 2006. No interest is charged
                on
                the advance for losses, which will be repaid out of future available
                profits generated by the hotel, or will be settled if the Company
                closes
                on the purchase option it has for the hotel (see Note 9 - Legal
                Proceedings). 

(d)    
             
                During
                the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company advanced $1,025,000 to Chateau
                Sonesta Hotel New Orleans, which it operates under a long term management
                agreement. This advance was primarily used for the payment of ongoing
                expenses during the period the hotel was closed from August 29 to
                November
                30, 2005, and to repair damage from Hurricane Katrina. The hotel s owner
                has filed claims under its building insurance policy, which includes
                business interruption provisions, but the amount and the timing of
                the
                insurance recovery is uncertain. If insurance proceeds are insufficient,
                the Company has the right to recover these advances, together with
                interest at the prime rate (7.25% at December 31, 2005) plus three
                (3)
                percentage points out of first available income from the hotel. The
                Company has been in discussions with the hotel s owner regarding a
                possible acquisition of the hotel, but no agreements have been
                reached. 

Management
      continually monitors the collectability of its (long-term) receivables and
      advances and believes they are fully realizable. 

4.       Borrowing
      Arrangements  

Credit
      Line  

The
      Company has a $2,000,000 demand line of credit. This line bears interest at
      the
      prime rate (7.25% at December 31, 2005). Advances under this line require the
      bank s approval each time a request is made. No amounts were outstanding under
      this line of credit at December 31, 2005.  

There
      were no short-term borrowings during 2005. During 2004 and 2003, average
      short-term borrowings were $21,000 and $227,000, respectively, at average
      interest rates of 4% and 4.1%. The maximum amounts of short-term borrowings
      during 2004 and 2003 were $800,000 and $2,119,000, respectively.  

Long-Term
      Debt  

The
      Company s long-term debt is secured by a first mortgage on the Royal Sonesta
      Hotel Boston (Cambridge) property, which is included in fixed assets at a net
      book value of $20,235,000 at December 31, 2005. The interest rate is 8.6% for
      the term of the loan. 

In
      April
      2005, the Company closed on a transaction to transfer the land and improvements
      of the Sonesta Beach Resort, Key Biscayne (see Note 2 - Operations). As part
      of
      this transaction, the note secured by the Key Biscayne hotel was repaid. By
      agreement with the lender, the Company paid $5,572,000 to reduce the principal
      balance of the Royal Sonesta Hotel Boston (Cambridge) loan to $34,061,000.
      The
      $5,572,000 payment included $1,077,000 of deferred principal payments and an
      additional prepayment of $4,495,000 which was required by the lender because
      the
      Key Biscayne and Cambridge mortgage loans were
      cross-collateralized. 

Effective
      December 1, 2003, the Company and the lender restructured the mortgage loan.
      The
      Company is required to make payments of interest only at 5% per annum through
      December 1, 2006, and payments of interest only at 8.6% per annum from December
      1, 2006 through December 1, 2007. As of January 1, 2008, payments will be based
      on interest and principal, calculated on the original 25-year amortization
      schedule of the loan, taking into account the aforementioned prepayments of
      principal. During the restructuring period, interest will continue to accrue
      at
      8.6%, and excess cash flow from the Royal Sonesta Hotel Boston (Cambridge)
      hotel
      remaining after payment of interest is required to be paid into escrow, and
      may
      be used solely for the future payment of hotel expenses or capital expenditures,
      or to reduce the amount of the accrued and unpaid interest. At December 31,
      2005, the escrow balance equaled $267,000, which amount is included in
      Restricted Cash on the Company s balance sheet.  

18 

Aggregate
      principal payments for the years subsequent to December 31, 2005, are as
      follows: 

5.       Stockholders 
      Equity  

Basic
      Earnings (Losses) per Share  

As
      the
      Company has no dilutive securities, there is no difference between basic and
      diluted earnings per share. The following table sets forth the computation
      of
      basic income or losses per share (in thousands, except for per share
      data): 

6.     
             
                 Commitments
                and Contingencies  

The
      Company operates the Sonesta Hotel   Suites Coconut Grove, Miami, which is a
      condominium hotel that opened in April 2002, and the Trump International Sonesta
      Beach Resort, a condominium hotel in Sunny Isles, Florida, which opened in
      April
      2003. Under the management agreements for these hotels, the Company is committed
      to fund certain operating losses and minimum returns to the owners of the
      hotels. These commitments are described, in detail, in Note 2 -
      Operations. 

The
      Company has also guaranteed an equipment lease in the original amount of
      $1,000,000 on behalf of the Trump International Sonesta Beach Resort Sunny
      Isles. The lease is due in monthly installments with final payment due in June,
      2008. The Company would be obligated to perform under this guarantee if the
      Trump International Sonesta Beach Resort Sunny Isles failed to pay principal
      and
      interest payments to the lender when due. Including accrued interest, as of
      December 31, 2005 the maximum potential amount of future (undiscounted) payments
      under this agreement would be $585,000. 

The
      Company is committed to advance approximately $2.1 million to repair damage
      done
      by Hurricane Katrina to Chateau Sonesta Hotel New Orleans, which the Company
      operates under a long-term management agreement. 

The
      Company operates the Royal Sonesta Hotel, New Orleans, Louisiana, under a lease.
      In 2003 the Company exercised the second of three 10-year options to extend
      the
      lease. The lease requires payment of percentage rent based on net profits,
      as
      defined. The Company leases space for its executive offices in Boston,
      Massachusetts, which lease will expire in May 2012. The Company provides for
      rent expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. The Company
      is
      also committed, under various operating leases, for certain other property
      and
      real estate. 

Minimum
      fixed rentals under operating leases, principally on real estate, payable
      subsequent to December 31, 2005 (exclusive of real estate taxes, insurance
      and
      other occupancy costs) are as follows: 

Rentals
      charged to operations are as follows: 

The
      Company has incentive compensation plans for management under which hotel profit
      bases, as established annually, must be achieved before any incentive
      compensation may be earned. The incentive compensation charged to operations
      was
      $422,000 in 2005, $533,000 in 2004 and $208,000 in 2003. 

7.       Pension
      and Benefit Plans  

Pension
      Plan  

The
      Company maintains a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (the Plan)
      for
      certain employees of Sonesta International Hotels Corporation and its
      subsidiaries. Benefits are based on the employee s years of service and the
      highest average monthly salary during any 60 consecutive months of employment.
      The Company s funding policy is to contribute annually at least the minimum
      contribution required by ERISA. The Company does not offer any other
      post-retirement benefit plans. 

Plan
      Changes  

Effective
      January 1, 2006, the Pension Plan was amended to increase the total number
      of
      years of service required to be eligible for full benefits under the Plan from
      27 to 35 years. At the same time, a minimum benefit payable for each year of
      service was reduced. These Plan changes will reduce the annual service cost
      of
      the Plan going forward. 

19 

Obligations
      and Funded Status  

The
      following table sets forth the funded status of the Plan at December 31, 2005
      and 2004: 

The
      Company recognized accrued benefit costs of $6,762,000 and $6,134,000 in its
      statement of financial position at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
      respectively. 

The
      following table presents the projected and accumulated benefit obligation
      compared to plan assets: 

The
        components of the Company s net periodic pension cost for the Plan were as
        follows: 

Weighted-average
      assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at each of the three years
      ending December 31 were: 

Weighted-average
      assumptions used to determine net periodic pension costs for each of the three
      years ended December 31 were: 

The
      assumed rate of return on plan assets has remained unchanged since 1988.
      Management believes 8.50% is a realistic long-term rate of return. The balanced
      retirement fund into which plan assets have been invested since 1987 has
      provided a composite average annual rate of return of 10.5% since
      1987. 

Plan
      Assets   

The
      Plan s weighted-average asset allocations at December 31, 2005 and 2004, by
      asset category, were as follows: 

The
      Plan s assets have been invested in a balanced retirement investment fund
      managed by a Boston-based investment management company since 1987. The
      investment objective of the fund is to achieve capital growth over the long-term
      through a broadly diversified, actively managed blend of stocks, bonds and
      money
      market instruments. In order to moderate the Fund s risk and volatility, a mix
      of assets is selected for the Fund with the dual objective of providing the
      opportunity to participate in favorable economic environments, and also
      moderating downside risk in the event economic conditions deteriorate. To
      further balance risk and return, individual investments are held across a wide
      range of economic sectors. Specific equity selections focus on financially
      sound
      companies with strong competitive positions in their industry. Bond holdings
      are
      primarily of higher quality issuers. 

20 

Cash
      Flows  

The
      Company expects to make contributions to its Plan in 2006 of
      $470,000. 

The
      following table sets forth estimated future benefit payments from the Plan.
      These estimated payments include expected future service. 

Savings
      Plan  

The
      Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings Plan) that qualifies as a
      deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      Under the Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of
      their pre-tax earnings up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution
      limit. All U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate in the
      Savings Plan. Participating employees may choose to invest their contributions
      in each one of twenty-one mutual funds, which include equity funds, balanced
      funds and a money market fund. The Savings Plan does not provide for
      contributions by the Company. The Company does bear the costs of administering
      the Plan, which were $20,000 for 2005, $23,000 for 2004 and $25,000 for
      2003. 

8.  

Segment
                Information   

The
      Company has two reportable segments: Owned and Leased Hotels, and Management
      Activities. The Owned and Leased Hotels segment consists of the operations
      of
      the Company s hotels in Boston (Cambridge), Key Biscayne and New Orleans.
      Revenues for this segment are derived mainly from rooms, food and beverage,
      parking and telephone receipts from hotel guests. The Management Activities
      segment includes the operations of hotels and resorts under management
      agreements, and also includes fees from hotels to which the Company has granted
      licenses. Revenues from this segment are derived mainly from management,
      marketing, license and service fees charged to the third party owners of these
      properties. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same
      as
      those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The segments 
      operating income or losses and pretax profit or losses are after giving effect
      to management, marketing and service fees to the Company s owned and leased
      properties. Segment data for the three years ended December 31, 2005
      follows: 

Note:
      Included in other income under Management Activities is a gain on the sale
      of
      land by the Company, originally intended for hotel development. 

21 

Segment
      assets for Management Activities in the information above include cash held
      in
      corporate accounts, and loans to and receivables from properties under
      management and license agreements. Segment assets for Owned and Leased hotels
      include the book value of the hotels  fixed assets, and the hotels  other
      current and long-term assets.  

Segment
      data by geographic area of the Company's revenues, operating income and
      long-lived assets follows:

9.     
             
                 Legal
                Proceedings  

Trump
      International Sonesta Beach Resort Sunny Isles   

Sonesta
      Hotels of Florida, Inc. ( SHF ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,
      operates Trump International Sonesta Beach Resort, in Sunny Isles, Florida
      (the
 Hotel ), under a management agreement with the Hotel s owner, Sunny Isles
      Luxury Ventures L.C. ( SILV ). The Hotel opened for business in April 2003. The
      Hotel is a condominium hotel, and the guestrooms are owned by third party buyers
      and, to the extent condominium units remain unsold, by SILV. The management
      agreement includes an option for SHF to purchase the Hotel s non-guestroom areas
      (the  Hotel Lot ) and meeting facilities (the  Commercial Lot ). The combined
      purchase price is twenty four million dollars ($24,000,000), which would be
      100%
      financed by SILV by means of a non-recourse, 25-year loan secured by a mortgage
      on the Hotel and Commercial Lot. SHF exercised its purchase option for the
      Hotel
      Lot in September 2004, and the parties agreed that they would close the
      transaction in early January 2005. Despite its earlier agreements, SILV took
      the
      position that it would not close on this transaction and, in response, the
      Company filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of the 11   th   
      Judicial
      Circuit in Miami-Dade County, Florida, to compel SILV to close the transaction.
      In connection with a mediation procedure, SILV and the Company entered into
      an
      agreement in September 2005 pursuant to which, subject to certain contingencies,
      the transaction would close in January 2006. In addition, the Company and SILV
      agreed on the amount of pre-opening expenses the Company advanced and is
      entitled to receive back following a completion of the purchase transaction;
      and
      also agreed on the amount SILV is entitled to for the Company s contribution to
      the Hotel s non-guestroom furniture, fixtures and equipment. Both these issues
      were the subject of previous arbitration procedures. SILV and the Company have
      been working on finalizing closing documents, but the actual closing has been
      further delayed as certain items in the agreement of September 2005 have not
      been concluded, and additional issues have been raised. The Company will
      continue to work on finding an amicable solution to these issues, but does
      not
      preclude going back to court to compel SILV to close on the transaction.
      Meanwhile, the Company settled the amount owed for pre-opening expenses, after
      deducting amounts owed to SILV for the Company s FF E contribution from
      Hotel funds that would otherwise be owed to SILV. If the closing of the purchase
      takes place pursuant to the agreement reached in September 2005, minimum annual
      payments would increase from the current $800,000 to $900,000 in 2006, and
      increase by $50,000 increments each year to a maximum of $1,100,000 in 2010
      and
      each year thereafter. Therefore, the delay has no detrimental effect on the
      Company s cash flow. Based on the terms of the September 2005 agreements, and
      assuming the purchase is completed, the Company s management and ownership of
      the Hotel and Commercial Lot beyond January 2008 is subject to certain
      contingencies, which include standards regarding the quality of the
      operations. 

Chateau
      Sonesta Hotel New Orleans  

A
      subsidiary of the Company, Sonesta Louisiana Hotels Corporation ( SLHC ), which
      operates Chateau Sonesta Hotel, in New Orleans (the  Hotel ), was involved in an
      arbitration pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement between the owner
      of the Hotel and SLHC. The owner alleged that SLHC failed to perform certain
      obligations under the Management Agreement, specifically its obligations to
      (A)
 use all reasonable efforts to operate the Hotel in a manner that achieves a
      high level of guest satisfaction and profitability , and (B) exercise all
      reasonable efforts to assure that Sonesta Hotels  corporate services  are billed
      to the Hotel and to the Royal Sonesta Hotel, New Orleans on a fair and equitable
      basis . The position established by owner s arbiter claimed damages of
      $2,952,000, and SLHC s arbiter maintained that no more than $268,000 in damages
      should be awarded. In May 2004, a decision was rendered in favor of SLHC by
      a
      third arbiter selected by the parties. The Company recorded expenses of $281,000
      and $847,000 in 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to the award for damages
      of
      $268,000, as well as its share of the costs of the arbitration, and the
      Company s legal and consulting fees. 

The
      Company is also from time to time subject to routine litigation incidental
      to
      its business, and generally covered by insurance. The Company believes that
      the
      results of such litigation will not have a materially adverse effect on the
      Company s financial condition. 

The
      table
      below allocates the Company's income tax expense (benefit) based upon the source
      of income: 

During
      2003 and 2004, the Company recorded valuation allowances totaling $3,862,000
      against the federal income tax benefits on its pre-tax losses of approximately
      $10.6 million incurred during these two years, since it was uncertain if the
      Company could realize a future benefit for these losses. In addition, valuation
      allowances of $296,000 were recorded against Florida state tax loss carry
      forwards, for the same reason. In April 2005, the Company completed the transfer
      of the land and improvements of Sonesta Beach Resort Key Biscayne (see Note
      2 -
      Operations). This transaction resulted in significant taxable income, and the
      Company therefore reversed in 2005 the valuation allowances previously recorded,
      since it will receive a benefit in 2005 for the prior years 
      losses. 

In
      2005,
      a foreign subsidiary of the Company sold land it had owned in Costa Rica, and
      recorded a pre-tax gain of $3,950,000 on the sale. The foreign subsidiary
      remitted the proceeds to the parent company, and in accordance with IRS Code
      Section 965(a) of the American Job Creations Act of 2004, the Company was able
      to receive a  temporary dividends received deduction  of approximately $3.1
      million, resulting in tax savings of approximately $1.1 million. 

23 

A
      reconciliation of net tax expense (benefit) applicable to income or losses
      at
      the statutory rate follows: 

Deferred
      tax expense (benefits) result from temporary differences in the recognition
      of
      revenues and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes. The source
      of
      these differences and their tax effects are as follows: 

24 

Temporary
      differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis
      of assets and liabilities that give rise to significant portions of deferred
      income taxes at December 31, 2005 and 2004 relate to the following: 

At
      December 31, 2005, the Company had state net operating loss carry-forwards
      of
      approximately $23,500,000 for income tax purposes. Of the total carry-forwards
      available at December 31, 2005, approximately $2,000,000 expires in 2006,
      $3,200,000 expires in 2007, $4,800,000 expires in 2008, $4,900,000 expires
      in
      2009, $4,200,000 expires in 2010, and $4,400,000 expires in 2011. For financial
      reporting purposes, valuation allowances of $1,600,000 and $1,500,000 have
      been
      recognized at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, to offset the deferred
      tax assets related to those carry-forwards.

REPORT
      OF REGISTERED INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS   

To
      the
      Board of Directors and Stockholders of  

      Sonesta
      International Hotels Corporation: 

We
      have
      audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sonesta International
      Hotels Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
      related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders  equity and cash
      flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are
      the
      responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an
      opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We
      conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
      financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not
      required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal
      control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal
      control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures
      that
      are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
      an
      opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial
      reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining,
      on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
      financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
      estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
      statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
      for our opinion. 

In
      our
      opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,
      in all material respects, the financial position of Sonesta International Hotels
      Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
      consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years
      then
      ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
      States of America.

The
      Board
      of Directors and Stockholders of 

      Sonesta
      International Hotels Corporation 

We
      have
      audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Sonesta International
      Hotels Corporation as of December 31, 2003, and the related consolidated
      statements of operations, stockholders  equity and cash flows for the year then
      ended. Our audit also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
      Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the
      responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an
      opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
      audit. 

We
      conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
      statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform
      an
      audit of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Our audit
      included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis
      for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
      not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
      Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly we express no
      such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
      supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
      the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management
      and
      evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
      audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In
      our
      opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
      material respects, the consolidated financial position of Sonesta International
      Hotels Corporation at December 31, 2003, and the consolidated results of its
      operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with U.S
      generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related
      financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
      statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
      information set forth therein.

        I,
        Stephanie Sonnabend, certify that: 

1.    
             
                I
                have reviewed the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
                ended
                December 31, 2005 of Sonesta International Hotels
                Corporation; 

2.    
             
                Based
                on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement
                of a
                material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make
                the
                statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
                were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
                report; 

3.    
             
                Based
                on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information
                included in this report, fairly present in all material respects
                the
                financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the
                registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this
                report; 

4.    
             
                The
                registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for
                establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
                defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for the registrant
                and have: 

a) 

Designed
                  such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure
                  controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to
                  ensure
                  that material information relating to the registrant, including
                  its
                  consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within
                  those
                  entities, particularly during the period in which this report is
                  being
                  prepared; 

b)    
             
                Evaluated
                the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures
                and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness
                of
                the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period
                covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

c)    
             
                Disclosed
                in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over
                financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent
                fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an
                annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
                to
                materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial
                reporting; and  

5. 

The
                  registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on
                  our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting,
                  to the registrant s auditors and the Audit Committee of registrant s Board
                  Directors (or persons performing the equivalent
                  functions): 

a) 

All
                  significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
                  or
                  operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
                  reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record,
                  process, summarize and report financial information;
                  and 

b)    
             
                Any
                fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
                employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control
                over financial reporting.
