PART
        I   

In
        this annual report on Form 10-K, we refer to Dynex Capital, Inc. and its
        subsidiaries as  we,   us,   Dynex,  or  the Company,  unless specifically
        indicated otherwise.  

Item
        1.       BUSINESS  

GENERAL  

Dynex
        Capital, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is a specialty finance company
        organized as a real estate investment trust (REIT) that invests in loans
        and
        securities consisting principally of single-family residential and commercial
        mortgage loans. We finance these loans and securities through a combination
        of
        non-recourse securitization financing, repurchase agreements, and equity.
        We
        employ financing in order to increase the overall yield on our invested capital.
        Our ownership of these investments, and the use of leverage, exposes us to
        credit risk, interest-rate risk, margin call risk, and prepayment risk. As
        a
        REIT, we are required to distribute to stockholders as dividends at least
        90% of
        our taxable income, which is our income as calculated for tax, after
        consideration of any tax net operating loss (NOL) carrryforwards. 

We
        own
        both investment grade and non-investment grade investments. Our ownership
        of
        non-investment grade securities is generally in the form of the first-loss
        or
        subordinate classes of securitization trusts, to date most of which we have
        sponsored. In securitization trusts, loans and securities are pledged to
        a
        trust, and the trust issues bonds pursuant to an indenture. We typically
        retain
        the lowest-rated bond classes in the trust, often referred to as subordinate
        bonds or overcollateralization. While the securitization trust is consolidated
        in our financial statements, the performance of our investment depends on
        the
        performance of the subordinate bonds and overcollateralization. The overall
        performance of the subordinate bonds and overcollateralization is highly
        dependent on the credit performance of the underlying assets. 

In
        recent
        years, we have elected to sell certain non-core assets, including investments
        in
        manufactured housing loans and delinquent property tax receivable portfolios.
        Our emphasis has been on monetizing underperforming assets in anticipation
        of
        redeploying the invested capital in more compelling investment opportunities.
        The investment sales and lack of reinvestment of our capital has resulted
        in the
        reduction in investments of $1,097 million over the last 24 months, and the
        increase in our investable capital to approximately $60 million at the end
        of
        2005.  

Given
        the
        current flat treasury yield curve, however, and the challenging reinvestment
        environment in traditional mortgage REIT investment opportunities, we have
        been
        compelled to retain capital generated from the sales and from the normal
        cash
        flows of our investment portfolio. In 2004, we completed a recapitalization
        of
        our equity capital structure through the exchange of our outstanding shares
        of
        Series A, Series B and Series C preferred stock into shares of new Series
        D
        preferred stock and common stock. The recapitalization resulted in the
        elimination or payment-in-kind of $18.5 million of dividends in arrears and
        the
        issuance of 1,288,488 shares of common stock. The shares of Series D preferred
        stock automatically convert to 9.50% senior notes if the Company fails to
        pay
        two consecutive quarterly preferred dividends or if the Company fails to
        maintain consolidated shareholders  equity of at least 200% of the aggregate
        issue price of the Series D preferred stock. In light of the lack of compelling
        investment opportunities, we utilized a portion of our investable capital
        to
        redeem approximately $14 million, or 25%, of our 9.50% Series D Preferred
        Stock
        outstanding in January 2006. We have also announced a common stock repurchase
        program for up to one million shares of stock. After the redemption of the
        Series D Preferred Stock in January, our GAAP shareholders  equity will decline
        to approximately $135.2 million after the completion of the redemption.

Unlike
        other mortgage REITs, our required REIT income distributions are likely to
        be
        limited well into the future due to the reduction of our future taxable income
        by our NOL carryforwards, which were approximately $135 million at December
        31,
        2004. As a result, we anticipate that we will invest our capital and compound
        the returns on such invested capital on an essentially tax-free basis for
        the
        foreseeable future. Over the long-term this will allow us to increase our
        book
        value per common share while potentially utilizing a lower risk investment
        strategy than some of our competitors would have to utilize in order to achieve
        similar results. 

We
        were
        incorporated in the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1987, and began operations
        in
        1988.

BUSINESS
        MODEL AND
        STRATEGY  

As
        a
        REIT, we seek to generate net interest income from our investment portfolio.
        We
        earn the excess of the interest income on our investment assets over the
        costs
        of the financing of those assets. The net interest income is directly impacted
        by the credit performance of the underlying loans and securities, by the
        level
        of prepayments of the underlying loans and securities, and, to a lesser extent,
        by changes in interest rates. Net interest income is also dependent on our
        investment strategy and the reinvestment rate for our investable capital.
        We
        intend to invest in assets, and structure the financing of these assets,
        in such
        a way that will generate reasonably stable net interest income in a variety
        of
        prepayment, interest rate and credit environments. Our business model and
        strategy have inherent risk, a discussion of these risks is provided in
   Risk
        Factors   
        in Item
        1A below. 

We
        have
        an investment policy which governs the allocation of capital amongst short-term,
        highly liquid investments, investment grade fixed income investments,
        subordinate and credit sensitive investments, and strategic investments.
        Strategic investments are investments in equity and equity-like securities
        of
        other companies, including other mortgage REITs. Strategic investments may
        or
        may not be qualifying investments for the respective REIT tests described
        in
   Federal
        Income Tax Considerations.   
        Our
        capital allocations are reviewed annually by the Board of Directors, and
        are
        adjusted for a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the current
        investment climate, the current interest-rate environment, competition, and
        our
        desire for capital preservation. 

We
        currently are also seeking joint-venture or other arrangements with other
        mortgage REITs, hedge funds, money managers, Wall Street firms, or other
        specialty finance companies for purposes of leveraging their expertise and
        resources for the reinvestment and management of a portion of our available
        capital in accordance with the requirements of our investment policy. We
        believe
        that utilizing the expertise and resources of third-parties given the current
        competitive environment for mortgage and related assets may be a better means
        for generating investment opportunities, and managing the various risks
        associated with these investments. We are seeking arrangements with credible
        third parties which provide complimentary expertise to our expertise in
        structured investments. To date we have had numerous discussions with potential
        third parties with no firm commitment to enter into a relationship,
        joint-venture, or co-investment strategy with these parties. 

Because
        of our NOL carryforwards, our distribution requirements to maintain our eligible
        REIT status are limited. However, our Series D Preferred Stock requires the
        payment of a quarterly dividend, and if the dividend is missed for a period
        of
        two consecutive quarters, the Series D Preferred Stock will automatically
        convert into senior notes. While we will continually evaluate whether to
        pay
        dividends on our common stock, we intend for the foreseeable future to retain
        net income to common shareholders for the future growth of the investment
        portfolio, offsetting any REIT distribution requirements with our NOL
        carryforward. In this way, we intend to retain net income to grow our capital
        base, while at the same time growing our common book value and common book
        value
        per share. At December 31, 2005, common book value was $93.0 million or $7.65
        per common share. Considering our NOL carryfoward of approximately $135 million
        as of December 31, 2004, we could increase common book value by $135 million,
        to
        an approximate total of $228 million or approximately $19 per common share,
        before we would be required to make a distribution to our common shareholders.
        We have not yet completed our tax calculation for 2005, but we anticipate
        reporting a net tax loss, primarily related to book-tax differences related
        to
        the sale of certain securitization finance receivables during 2005. Although
        we
        do not foresee any issues with our ability to use our NOL carryforwards to
        offset future taxable income, there are circumstances that could restrict
        our
        ability to do so, which include restrictions based on changes in the ownership
        of the Company. While we are retaining amounts that otherwise would be
        distributed to shareholders, we believe that this enhances overall shareholder
        value in the Company.  

COMPETITION  

The
        financial services industry is a highly competitive industry in which we
        compete
        with a number of institutions with greater financial resources. In purchasing
        portfolio investments, financing such purchases, and in issuing securities,
        we
        compete with other mortgage REITs, investment banking firms, savings and
        loan
        associations, commercial banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, federal
        agencies, foreign investors, and other entities, many of which have greater
        financial resources and a lower cost of capital than we do. Increased
        competition in the market and our competitors  greater financial resources have
        driven down returns on investments and has adversely impacted our ability
        to
        invest our capital on an acceptable risk-adjusted basis, and may continue
        to do
        so for the foreseeable future.

        officers. 

FEDERAL
        INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS  

We
        believe that we have complied with the requirements for qualification as
        a REIT
        under the Internal Revenue Code (the  Code ). The REIT rules generally require
        that a REIT invest primarily in real estate-related assets, that our activities
        be passive rather than active and that we distribute annually to our
        shareholders substantially all of our taxable income. In addition, a REIT
        is
        required to distribute 90% of its taxable income, after certain deductions,
        including deductions for NOL carryforwards. We could be subject to income
        tax if
        we failed to satisfy those requirements or if we acquired certain types of
        income-producing real property. For the foreseeable future, we intend to
        offset
        taxable income with our NOL carryforwards, enabling us to retain taxable
        net
        income generated for reinvestment opportunities and our future growth.

We
        use
        the calendar year for both tax and financial reporting purposes. There may
        be
        differences between taxable income and income computed in accordance with
        GAAP.
        These differences primarily arise from timing differences in the recognition
        of
        revenue and expense for tax and GAAP purposes. We currently have tax operating
        loss carryforwards of approximately $135 million, which expire between 2019
        and
        2024. We also had excess inclusion income of $1.4 million from our ownership
        of
        certain investments. Excess inclusion income cannot be offset by NOL
        carryforwards, and therefore, in order to meet REIT distribution requirements,
        we must distribute all of our excess inclusion income. 

Failure
        to satisfy certain Code requirements could cause us to lose our status as
        a
        REIT. If we failed to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year, we may be subject
        to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax)
        at
        regular corporate rates and would not receive deductions for dividends paid
        to
        shareholders. We could, however, utilize our NOL carryforward to offset any
        taxable income. In addition, given the size of our NOL carryfoward, we could
        pursue a business plan in the future in which we would voluntarily forego
        our
        REIT status. If we lost our status as a REIT, we could not elect REIT
        status again for five years. Several of our investments in securitization
        finance receivables are have ownership restrictions limited to ownership
        by a
        REIT. Therefore, if we chose to forego our REIT status, we would have to
        sell
        these investments, or otherwise provide for REIT ownership of these investments.

We
        also
        have a taxable REIT subsidiary (TRS), which has a NOL carryforward of
        approximately $4 million. The TRS has limited operations, and, accordingly,
        we
        have established a full valuation allowance for the related deferred tax
        asset. 

Qualification
        as a REIT  

Qualification
        as a REIT requires that we satisfy a variety of tests relating to our income,
        assets, distributions and ownership. The significant tests are summarized
        below. 

Sources
        of Income   .
        To
        continue qualifying as a REIT, we must satisfy two distinct tests with respect
        to the sources of our income: the  75% income test  and the  95% income test. 
The 75% income test requires that we derive at least 75% of our gross income
        (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) from certain real
        estate-related sources. In order to satisfy the 95% income test, 95% of our
        gross income for the taxable year must consist either of income that qualifies
        under the 75% income test or certain other types of passive income. 

3 

If
        we
        fail to meet either the 75% income test or the 95% income test, or both,
        in a
        taxable year, we might nonetheless continue to qualify as a REIT, if our
        failure
        was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect and the nature and amounts
        of our items of gross income were properly disclosed to the Internal Revenue
        Service. However, in such a case we would be required to pay a tax equal
        to 100%
        of any excess non-qualifying income. 

Nature
        and Diversification of Assets   .
        At the
        end of each calendar quarter, three asset tests must be met by us. Under
        the 75%
        asset test, at least 75% of the value of our total assets must represent
        cash or
        cash items (including receivables), government securities or real estate
        assets.
        Under the  10% asset test,  we may not own more than 10% of the outstanding
        voting securities of any single non-governmental issuer, provided such
        securities do not qualify under the 75% asset test or relate to taxable REIT
        subsidiaries. Under the  5% asset test,  ownership of any stocks or securities
        that do not qualify under the 75% asset test must be limited, in respect
        of any
        single non-governmental issuer, to an amount not greater than 5% of the value
        of
        the total assets of us. 

If
        we
        inadvertently fail to satisfy one or more of the asset tests at the end of
        a
        calendar quarter, such failure would not cause us to lose our REIT status,
        provided that (i) we satisfied all of the asset tests at the close of a
        preceding calendar quarter and (ii) the discrepancy between the values of
        our assets and the standards imposed by the asset tests either did not exist
        immediately after the acquisition of any particular asset or was not wholly
        or
        partially caused by such an acquisition. If the condition described in clause
        (ii) of the preceding sentence was not satisfied, we still could avoid
        disqualification by eliminating any discrepancy within 30 days after the
        close
        of the calendar quarter in which it arose. 

Ownership   .
        In
        order to maintain our REIT status, we must not be deemed to be closely held
        and
        must have more than 100 shareholders. The closely held prohibition requires
        that
        not more than 50% of the value of our outstanding shares be owned by five
        or
        fewer persons at anytime during the last half of our taxable year. The more
        than
        100 shareholders rule requires that we have at least 100 shareholders for
        335
        days of a twelve-month taxable year. In the event that we failed to satisfy
        the
        ownership requirements we would be subject to fines and be required to take
        curative action to meet the ownership requirements in order to maintain our
        REIT
        status. 

Taxable
        Income  

We
        use
        the calendar year for both tax and financial reporting purposes. However,
        there
        may be differences between taxable income and income computed in accordance
        with
        GAAP. These differences primarily arise from timing differences in the
        recognition of revenue and expense for tax and GAAP purposes. The principal
        difference relates to reserves for loan losses and other-than-temporary
        impairment charges provided for GAAP purposes, which are not deductible for
        tax
        purposes, versus actual charge-offs on loans or realization of a losses on
        securities, which are deductible for tax purposes as ordinary
        losses. 

EMPLOYEES  

As
        of
        December 31, 2005, we had 20 employees. Our relationship with our employees
        is
        good. None of our employees are covered by any collective bargaining agreements,
        and we are not aware of any union organizing activity relating to our
        employees. 

ITEM
        1A. RISK FACTORS  

Our business is subject to various risks, including the risks described below.
        Our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially
        and
        adversely affected by any of these risks. Please note that additional risks
        not
        presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair
        our
        business and operations. 

We
        may be unable to invest in new assets with attractive yields, and yields
        on new
        assets in which we do invest may not generate attractive yields, resulting
        in a
        decline in our earnings per share over time.   

Since
        2004 we have sold investments or assets have otherwise paid down in the amount
        of $1,097 million. Asset yields today are generally lower that those assets
        sold
        or repaid, due to lower overall interest rates and more competition for these
        assets. We have generally been unable to find investments which have acceptable
        risk adjusted yields. As a result, our 

4 

net
        interest income has been declining, and may continue to decline in the future,
        resulting in lower earnings per share over time. In order to maintain our
        investment portfolio size and our earnings, we need to reinvest a portion
        of the
        cash flows we receive into new interesting earning assets. 

Our
        ownership of certain subordinate interests in securitization trusts subjects
        us
        to credit risk on the underlying loans, and we provide for loss reserves
        on
        these loans as required under GAAP.    

As
        the
        result of our ownership of the overcollateralization portion of the
        securitization trust, the predominant risk to us in our investment portfolio
        is
        credit risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss to us from the failure by a
        borrower (or the proceeds from the liquidation of the underlying collateral)
        to
        fully repay the principal balance and interest due on a loan. A borrower s
        ability to repay and the value of the underlying collateral could be negatively
        influenced by economic and market conditions. These conditions could be global,
        national, regional or local in nature. Upon securitization of the pool of
        loans
        or securities backed by loans, the credit risk retained by us from an economic
        point of view is generally limited to the overcollateralization tranche of
        the
        securitization trust. We provide for estimated losses on the gross amount
        of
        loans pledged to securitization trusts included in our financial statements
        as
        required by GAAP. In some instances, we may also retain subordinated bonds
        from
        the securitization trust, which increases our credit risk above the
        overcollateralization tranche from an economic perspective. We provide reserves
        for existing losses based on the current performance of the respective pool
        or
        on an individual loan basis. If losses are experienced more rapidly, due
        to
        declining property performance, market conditions or other factors, than
        we have
        provided for in our reserves, we may be required to provide for additional
        reserves for these losses.  

Certain
        investments employ internal structural leverage as a result of the
        securitization process, and       are
        in the most subordinate position in the capital structure, which magnifies
        the
        potential impact of adverse events on our cash flows and reported results.

Many
        of
        the loans that we own have been pledged to securitization trusts which employ
        a
        high degree of internal structural leverage and concentrated credit, interest
        rate, prepayment, or other risks. We have generally retained the most
        subordinate classes of the securitization trust. As a result of these factors,
        net interest income and cash flows on our investments will vary based on
        the
        performance of the assets pledged to the securitization trust. In particular,
        should assets meaningfully underperform as to delinquencies, defaults, and
        credit losses, it is possible that cash flows which may have otherwise been
        paid
        to us as a result of our ownership of the subordinate interests, may be retained
        within the securitization trust. No amount of risk management or mitigation
        can
        change the variable nature of the cash flows and financial results generated
        by
        concentrated risks in our investments. None of our existing securities at
        December 31, 2005 have reached these predetermined levels, but such levels
        could
        be reached in the future. 

Our
        efforts to manage credit risk may not be successful in limiting delinquencies
        and defaults in underlying loans or losses on our
        investments.   

Despite
        our efforts to manage credit risk, there are many aspects of credit that
        we
        cannot control. Third party servicers provide for the primary and special
        servicing of our loans. We have a risk management function, which oversees
        the
        performance of these services and provides limited asset management
        capabilities. Our risk management operations may not be successful in limiting
        future delinquencies, defaults, and losses. The securitizations in which
        we have
        invested may not receive funds that we believe are due from mortgage insurance
        companies and other counter-parties. Loan servicing companies may not cooperate
        with our risk management efforts, or such efforts may be ineffective. Service
        providers to securitizations, such as trustees, bond insurance providers,
        and
        custodians, may not perform in a manner that promotes our interests. The
        value
        of the properties collateralizing residential loans may decline. The value
        of
        properties collateralizing commercial mortgage loans may decline. The frequency
        of default, and the loss severity on loans upon default, may be greater than
        we
        anticipated. If loans become  real estate owned  (REO), servicing companies will
        have to manage these properties and may not be able to sell them. Changes
        in
        consumer behavior, bankruptcy laws, tax laws, and other laws may exacerbate
        loan
        losses. In some states and circumstances, the securitizations in which we
        invest
        have recourse as owner of the loan against the borrower s other assets and
        income in the event of loan default; however, in most cases, the value of
        the
        underlying property will be the sole source of funds for any recoveries.

5 

Prepayments
        of principal on our investments, and the timing of prepayments, may impact
        our
        reported earnings and our cash flows.   

We
        own
        many of our securitization finance receivables at premiums to their principal
        balances, and have issued associated securitization financing bonds at
        discounts. Prepayments of principal on loans and the associated bonds, whether
        voluntary or involuntary, impact the amortization of premiums and discounts
        under the effective yield method of accounting that we use for GAAP accounting.
        Under the effective yield method of accounting, we recognize yields on our
        assets and effective costs of our liabilities based on assumptions regarding
        future cash flows. Variations in actual cash flows from those assumed as
        a
        result of prepayments, and subsequent changes in future cash flow expectations,
        will cause adjustments in yields on assets and costs of liabilities as a
        corresponding charge to earnings.  

In
        a
        period of declining interest rates, loans and securities in the investment
        portfolio will generally prepay more rapidly (to the extent that such loans
        are
        not prohibited from prepayment), which may result in additional amortization
        of
        asset premium. In a flat yield curve environment (   i.e.   ,
        when
        the spread between the yield on the one-year Treasury security and the yield
        on
        the ten-year Treasury security is less than 1.0%), adjustable rate mortgage
        loans and securities tend to rapidly prepay, causing additional amortization
        of
        asset premium. In addition, the spread between our funding costs and asset
        yields may compress, causing a further reduction in our net interest
        income. 

We
        finance a portion of our investment portfolio with short-term recourse
        repurchase agreements which subjects us to margin calls if the assets pledged
        subsequently decline in value.   

We
        finance a portion of our investments, primarily high credit-quality, liquid
        securities, with recourse repurchase agreements. These arrangements require
        us
        to maintain a certain level of collateral for the related borrowings. If
        the
        collateral should fall below the required level, the repurchase agreement
        lender
        could initiate a margin call. This would require that we either pledge
        additional collateral acceptable to the lender or repay a portion of the
        debt in
        order to meet the margin requirement. Should we be unable to meet a margin
        call,
        we may have to liquidate the collateral or other assets quickly. Because
        a
        margin call and quick sale could result in a lower than otherwise expected
        and
        attainable sale price, we may incur a loss on the sale of the
        collateral. 

We
        may be subject to the risks associated with inadequate or untimely services
        from
        third-party service providers, which may harm our results of
        operations.   

Our
        loans
        and loans underlying securities are serviced by third-party service providers.
        As with any external service provider, we are subject to the risks associated
        with inadequate or untimely services. Many borrowers require notices and
        reminders to keep their loans current and to prevent delinquencies and
        foreclosures. A substantial increase in our delinquency rate that results
        from
        improper servicing or loan performance in general could harm our ability
        to
        securitize our real estate loans in the future and may have an adverse effect
        on
        our earnings. 

Interest
        rate fluctuations can have various negative effects on us, and could lead
        to
        reduced earnings and/or increased earnings
        volatility.   

Our
        investment portfolio today is substantially match-funded, and overall we
        are
        largely insulated from material risks related to rising, or declining, interest
        rates. In the past however, we have been exposed to material changes in
        short-term interest rates, and depending on future investments, may again
        be
        exposed to these changes. Certain of our current investments and contemplated
        future investments are adjustable-rate loans and securities which have interest
        rates which reset semi-annually or annually, based on an index such as the
        one-year constant maturity treasury or the six-month London Interbank Offered
        Rate (LIBOR). These investments may be financed with borrowings which reset
        monthly, based upon one-month LIBOR. In a rising rate environment, net interest
        income earned on these investments may be reduced, as the interest cost for
        the
        funding sources could increase more rapidly than the interest earned on the
        associated asset financed. In a declining interest-rate environment, net
        interest income may be enhanced as the interest cost for the funding sources
        decreases more rapidly than the interest earned on the associated assets.
        To the
        extent that assets and liabilities are both fixed-rate or adjustable rate
        with
        corresponding payment dates, interest-rate risk may be mitigated.  

6 

Our
        reported income depends on accounting conventions and assumptions about the
        future that may change.   

Accounting
        rules for our assets, and for the various aspects of our current and future
        business change from time to time. Changes in GAAP, or the accepted
        interpretation of these accounting principles, can affect our reported income,
        earnings, and shareholders  equity. Interest income on our assets, and interest
        expense on our liabilities, may in part be based on estimates of future events.
        These estimates can change in a manner that harms our results or can
        demonstrate, in retrospect, that revenue recognition in prior periods was
        too
        high or too low. We use the effective yield method of GAAP accounting for
        many
        of our investments. We calculate projected cash flows for each of these assets
        incorporating assumptions about the amount and timing of credit losses, loan
        prepayment rates, and other factors. The yield we recognize for GAAP purposes
        generally equals the discount rate that produces a net present value for
        actual
        and projected cash flows that equals our GAAP basis in that asset. We change
        the
        yield recognized on these assets based on actual performance and as we change
        our estimates of future cash flows. The assumptions that underlie our projected
        cash flows and effective yield analysis may prove to be overly optimistic,
        or
        conversely, overly conservative. In these cases, our GAAP yield on the asset,
        or
        cost of the liability may change, leading to changes in our reported GAAP
        results. 

Failure
        to qualify as a REIT would adversely affect our dividend distributions and
        could
        adversely affect the value of our securities.   

We
        believe that we have met all requirements for qualification as a REIT for
        federal income tax purposes and we intend to continue to operate so as to
        qualify as a REIT in the future. However, many of the requirements for
        qualification as a REIT are highly technical and complex and require an analysis
        of factual matters and an application of the legal requirements to such factual
        matters in situations where there is only limited judicial and administrative
        guidance. Thus, no assurance can be given that the Internal Revenue Service
        or a
        court would agree with our conclusion that we have qualified as a REIT or
        that
        future changes in our factual situation or the law will allow us to remain
        qualified as a REIT. If we failed to qualify as a REIT for federal income
        tax
        purposes and did not meet the requirements for statutory relief, we could
        be
        subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on our income and
        we
        could possibly be disqualified as a REIT for four years thereafter. Failure
        to
        qualify as a REIT could force us to sell certain of our investments, possibly
        at
        a loss, and could adversely affect the value of our common stock. 

Maintaining
        REIT status may reduce our flexibility to manage our
        operations.   

To
        maintain REIT status, we must follow certain rules and meet certain tests.
        In
        doing so, our flexibility to manage our operations may be reduced. For
        instance: 

If
                  we make frequent asset sales from our REIT entities to persons
                  deemed
                  customers, we could be viewed as a  dealer,  and thus subject to 100%
                  prohibited transaction taxes or other entity level taxes on income
                  from
                  such transactions. 

Compliance
                  with the REIT income and asset rules may limit the type or extent
                  of
                  hedging that we can undertake. 

Our
                  ability to own non-real estate related assets and earn non-real
                  estate
                  related income is limited. Our ability to own equity interests
                  in other
                  entities is limited. If we fail to comply with these limits, we
                  may be
                  forced to liquidate attractive assets on short notice on unfavorable
                  terms
                  in order to maintain our REIT status. 

Our
                  ability to invest in taxable subsidiaries is limited under the
                  REIT rules.
                  Maintaining compliance with this limit could require us to constrain
                  the
                  growth of our taxable REIT affiliates in the future. 

Meeting
                  minimum REIT dividend distribution requirements could reduce our
                  liquidity. Earning non-cash REIT taxable income could necessitate
                  our
                  selling assets, incurring debt, or raising new equity in order
                  to fund
                  dividend distributions. 

Stock
                  ownership tests may limit our ability to raise significant amounts
                  of
                  equity capital from one source.

We
        may fail to properly conduct our operations so as to avoid falling under
        the
        definition of an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act
        of
        1940.   

We
        also
        conduct our operations so as to avoid falling under the definition of an
        investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940. If we
        were
        determined to be an investment company, our ability to use leverage would
        be
        substantially reduced, and our ability to conduct business may be impaired.
        Under the current interpretation of the staff of the Securities and Exchange
        Commission ( SEC ), in order to be exempted from regulation as an investment
        company, a REIT must, among other things, maintain at least 55% of its assets
        directly in qualifying real estate interests. In satisfying this 55%
        requirement, a REIT may treat mortgage-backed securities issued with respect
        to
        an underlying pool to which it holds all issued certificates as qualifying
        real
        estate interests. If the SEC or its staff adopts a contrary interpretation
        of
        such treatment, the REIT could be required to sell a substantial amount of
        these
        securities or other non-qualified assets under potentially adverse market
        conditions. 

We
        are dependent on certain key personnel.   

We
        have
        only one Executive Officer, Stephen J. Benedetti, who serves as our Executive
        Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. We currently do not have a Chief
        Executive Officer, President, or Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Benedetti
        previously served as our Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Benedetti has been
        with us
        since 1994 and has extensive knowledge of us, our operations, and our current
        investment portfolio. He also has extensive experience in managing a portfolio
        of mortgage-related investments, and as an executive officer of a
        publicly-traded mortgage REIT. The loss of Mr. Benedetti could have an adverse
        effect on our operations.

        2.       PROPERTIES  

Our
        executive and administrative offices and operations offices are both located
        in
        Glen Allen, Virginia, on properties leased by us. The address is 4551 Cox
        Road,
        Suite 300, Glen Allen, Virginia 23060. As of December 31, 2005, we leased
        8,244
        square feet. The term of the lease runs to May 2008.  

We
        believe that our property is maintained in good operating condition and is
        suitable and adequate for our purposes. 

ITEM
        3.       LEGAL
        PROCEEDINGS  

We
        and
        our subsidiaries may be involved in certain litigation matters arising in
        the
        ordinary course of businesses. Although the ultimate outcome of these matters
        cannot be ascertained at this time, and the results of legal proceedings
        cannot
        be predicted with certainty, we believe, based on current knowledge, that
        the
        resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our
        financial position or results of operations. Information on litigation arising
        out of the ordinary course of business is described below. 

We,
        and
        one of our subsidiaries, GLS Capital, Inc. ( GLS ), together with the County of
        Allegheny, Pennsylvania ( Allegheny County ), are defendants in a lawsuit in the
        Court of Common Pleas, in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Plaintiffs are
        two
        local businesses seeking status to represent, as a class, delinquent taxpayers
        in Allegheny County whose delinquent tax liens had been purchased by, and
        subsequently assigned to, GLS. This lawsuit relates to the purchase by GLS
        of
        delinquent property tax receivables from Allegheny County in 1997, 1998,
        and
        1999, and subsequent collection of certain amounts related to the property
        tax
        receivables purchased. The suit was initially filed in 1997, and challenges
        GLS 
right to charge   certain
        attorney fees, costs and expenses, and interest in the collection of delinquent
        property tax receivables owned by GLS. During 2005, the Court held hearings
        in
        this matter, and has not yet ruled on whether it will grant class action
        status

8 

in
        the
        litigation.  Plaintiffs have not enumerated its damages in this
        matter.  We believe the claims are without merit and we intend to
        vigorously defend ourselves in this matter. We believe that the ultimate
        outcome
        of this litigation will not have a material impact on our financial condition,
        but may have a material impact on reported results for the particular period
        presented.  

We
        and
        Dynex Commercial, Inc. ( DCI ), formerly our affiliate and now known as DCI
        Commercial, Inc., are appellees (or  respondents ) in the Court of Appeals for
        the Fifth Judicial District of Texas at Dallas, related to the matter of
        Basic
        Capital Management et al  (collectively,  BCM  or  the Plaintiffs ) versus
        Dynex Commercial, Inc. et al.  The appeal seeks to overturn a judgment from
        a lower court in favor of the Company and DCI which denied recovery to
        Plaintiffs, as discussed further below, and to have a judgment entered in
        favor
        of Plaintiffs based on a jury award for damages against the Company of $0.3
        million, and against DCI for $2.2 million or $25.6 million, all of which
        was set
        aside by the trial court.  In the alternative, Plaintiffs are seeking a new
        trial. The appeal relates to a suit filed against us and DCI in 1999, alleging,
          among
        other things, that DCI and we failed to fund tenant improvement or other
        advances allegedly required on various loans made by DCI to BCM, which loans
        were subsequently acquired by us; that DCI breached an alleged $160 million
         master  loan commitment entered into in February 1998; and that DCI breached
        another alleged loan commitment of approximately $9 million. The original
        trial
        commenced in January 2004, and, in February 2004, the jury in the case rendered
        a verdict in favor of one of the Plaintiffs and against us on the alleged
        breach
        of the loan agreements for tenant improvements and awarded that Plaintiff
        damages in the amount of $0.25 million. The jury entered a separate verdict
        against DCI in favor of BCM under two mutually exclusive damage models, for
        $2.2
        million and $25.6 million, respectively. The jury found in favor of DCI on
        the
        alleged $9 million loan commitment, but did not find in favor of DCI for
        counterclaims made against BCM. The jury also awarded the Plaintiffs attorneys 
fees in the amount of $2.1 million. After considering post-trial motions,
        the
        presiding judge entered judgment in favor of us and DCI, effectively overturning
        the verdicts of the jury and dismissing damages awarded by the jury. DCI
        is a
        former affiliate of ours, and we believe that we will have no obligation
        for
        amounts, if any, awarded to the Plaintiffs as a result of the actions of
        DCI.
  The
        Court
        of Appeals has scheduled an oral argument on the matter for April 18, 2006.

On
        February 11, 2005, a putative class action complaint alleging violations
        of the
        federal securities laws and various state common law claims was filed against
        us, our subsidiary MERIT Securities Corporation, Stephen J. Benedetti, the
        Company's Executive Vice President, and Thomas H. Potts, the Company's former
        President and a former Director, in United States District Court for the
        Southern District of New York ( District Court ) by the Teamsters Local 445
        Freight Division Pension Fund ("Teamsters").  The lawsuit purported to be a
        class action on behalf of purchasers of MERIT Series 13 securitization financing
        bonds, which are collateralized by manufactured housing loans.  On May 31,
        2005, the Teamsters filed an amended class action complaint.  The amended
        complaint dropped all state common law claims but added federal securities
        claims related to the MERIT Series 12 securitization financing bonds.  In
        February 2006, based on a motion to dismiss filed by us, the District Court
        dismissed Messrs. Benedetti and Potts from the suit, but did not dismiss
        the
        claims against us or MERIT. The Company has appealed the District Court s
        decision not to dismiss us or MERIT.  The Company has evaluated the
        allegations and believes them to be without merit and intends to vigorously
        defend itself against them. 

Although
        no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of the above
        litigation, the Company believes the resolution of these lawsuits will not
        have
        a material effect on our consolidated balance sheet but could materially
        affect
        our consolidated results of operations in a given year.

        FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS    
        AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY         SECURITIES  

Our
        common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol
         DX . The common stock was held by approximately [1,810] holders of record and
        beneficial holders who hold common stock in street name as of 

9 

December
        31, 2005. During the last two years, the high and low closing stock prices
        and
        cash dividends declared on common stock were as follows: 

Dividends
        declared by the Board of Directors have generally been for the purpose of
        maintaining our REIT status, and in compliance with requirements set forth
        at
        the time of the issuance of the Series D Preferred Shares. The quarterly
        dividend on Series D Preferred Shares is $0.2375 per share. In accordance
        with
        the terms of the Series D Preferred Shares, if we fail to pay two consecutive
        quarterly preferred dividends or if we fail to maintain consolidated
        shareholders  equity of at least 200% of the aggregate issue price of the Series
        D preferred stock, then these shares automatically convert into a new series
        of
        9.50% senior notes. Dividends for the preferred stock must be fully paid
        before
        dividends can be paid on common stock. No common dividends have been paid
        since
        1998.  

We
        did
        not repurchase any of our equity securities during the fourth quarter of
        2005.

(1)        Net
        interest income has declined due to a reduction in investments, declining
        yields
        on our interest-earning assets and an increase in our cost of funds.

(2)        Net
        interest income after provision for loan losses has increased due to a reduction
        in the manufactured housing loan loss provision associated with the
        derecognition of the MERIT Series 12 securitization.  

          (3)        Impairment
        charges have declined as a result of the sale of certain underperforming
        securities.  

          (4)        Certain
        deferred hedging gains and losses for 2002 and prior years were reclassified
        from securitized finance receivables to non-recourse securitization
        financing.

        Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
        Operations  

SUMMARY  

Dynex
        Capital, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is a specialty finance company
        organized as a real estate investment trust (REIT) that invests in loans
        and
        securities consisting principally of single-family residential and commercial
        mortgage loans. We finance these loans and securities through a combination
        of
        non-recourse securitization financing, repurchase agreements, and equity.
        We
        employ leverage in order to increase the overall yield on our invested capital.
        We seek to generate net interest income (i.e., interest income on investments
        in
        excess of the cost of financing these assets), which provide acceptable returns
        on our invested capital on a risk adjusted basis. 

In
        recent
        years, we have elected to sell certain non-core assets, including investments
        in
        manufactured housing loans and delinquent property tax receivable portfolios.
        Our emphasis has been on monetizing underperforming assets in anticipation
        of
        redeploying the invested capital in more compelling investment opportunities.
        Given the flat treasury yield curve, however, and the challenging reinvestment
        environment in traditional mortgage REIT investment opportunities, we have
        retained our capital in anticipation of more compelling investment opportunities
        in the future. We believe our strategy of retaining capital in the face of
        increases in interest-rates by the Federal Reserve of 3.50% since June 2004
        has
        protected shareholder value. 

We
        have
        an investment policy which governs the allocation of capital amongst short-term,
        highly liquid investments, investment grade fixed income investments,
        subordinate and credit sensitive investments, and strategic investments.
        Strategic investments are investments in equity and equity-like securities
        of
        other companies, including other mortgage REITs. We anticipate in 2006 making
        additional strategic investments while using our capital in the interim to
        pay
        down recourse debt or to invest only in short-term, highly liquid
        investments. 

During
        2005, we earned net income of $9.6 million, and net income to our common
        shareholders of $4.2 million. Because of differences in GAAP income and taxable
        income, we expect to report a tax loss but have not completed our tax
        calculation. Accordingly, we did not pay a dividend on the common shares
        outstanding and will increase our NOL carryforward, which was $135 million
        as of
        December 31, 2004. 

During
        2005, we continued the process of monetizing under-performing and non-core
        investments. These investments sold had a carrying value of $373.3 million
        , and
        we recorded net gains of $9.6 million , while derecognizing or repaying
        associated financing liabilities of $363.8 million. We also had paydowns
        of
        investments of $151.0 million which were utilized to repay the associated
        financing liabilities of $140.1 million. During 2005, we redeemed all of
        the
        bonds 

11 

issued
        by
        one of our securitization trusts, financing the acquisition of these bonds
        with
        repurchase agreements. We have kept the securitization financing bonds
        outstanding and pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements. At December
        31,
        2005, the bonds had an outstanding principal balance of $153.5 million, and
        the
        associated repurchase agreement financing had an outstanding balance of $133.1
        million . 

FINANCIAL
        CONDITION  

Comparative
        balance sheet information is set forth in the tables below: 

Securitized
        Finance Receivables  

Securitized
        finance receivables include loans and securities   consisting
        of or secured by principally single-family residential and commercial mortgage
        loans.   Securitized
        finance receivables decreased to $722.2 million at December 31,   2005  
        from
        $1,242.6 million at December 31, 2004. This decrease of $520.4 million is
        primarily the result of sales and derecognition of $370.1 million of
        receivables, and principal repayments of $151.0 million. Principal repayments
        resulted from normal principal amortization of the underlying loan or security,
        and higher than anticipated prepayments on these assets due to the favorable
        interest rate and real estate environment, leading to refinances of the
        underlying mortgages or sales of the underlying properties. In addition to
        the
        above, allowance for loan losses, primarily on delinquent commercial mortgage
        loans was increased by a net $5.7 million during the year.  

Securities  

Securities
        are predominantly investment grade single-family residential mortgage
        securities. Securities at December 31, 2005 include investment-grade rated
        securities of $23.0 million, and non-investment grade rated securities of
        $1.9
        million, including equity securities. Securities decreased to $24.9 million
        at
        December 31,   2005  
        compared
        to $87.7 million at December 31,   2004  ,
        primarily as a result of principal payments of $58.8 million on investment-grade
        securities during the year, net sales of $5.8 million of equity securities
        and a
        $0.7 million net decrease in market value of available-for-sale securities.
        These increases were partially offset by the purchase of $2.6 million of
        investment grade single-family residential securities. 

Other
        Investments  

Other
        investments at December 31,   2005  
        and 2004
        consist primarily of delinquent property tax receivables, a security
        collateralized by delinquent property tax receivables, and the associated
        real
        estate owned. Other investments 

12 

decreased
        to $4.1 million at December 31,   2005  
        compared
        to $7.6 million at December 31, 2004. This decrease of $3.5 million resulted
        from payments of $2.2 million collected in 2005 and applied against the carrying
        value of the investment, $0.8 million in net proceeds from sales of related
        real
        estate owned, a $1.7 million other-than-temporary impairment charge and losses
        on sales of REO properties of $0.2 million. These decreases were partially
        offset by increases related to advances made in the foreclosure of property
        tax
        receivables of $0.7 million and interest accretion of $0.6 million. 

Non-recourse
        Securitization Financing  

Non-recourse
        securitization financing decreased to $516.6 million at December 31,
  2005  
        from
        $1,177 million at December 31, 2004. This decrease was primarily a result
        of
        principal payments received of $102.5 million on the associated collateral
        pledged which were used to pay down the securitization financing in accordance
        with the respective indentures, the derecognition of $363.9 million of
        non-recourse securitization financing as a result of the sale of the associated
        securitized finance receivables as described above, and a redemption of $195.7
        million of certain outstanding bonds issued by us. The decrease also reflects
        a
        $0.6 million decline in accrued interest payable and an increase of $2.1
        million
        related to the amortization of bond discounts and issuance costs during the
        year. 

Repurchase
        Agreements Secured by Securitization Financing Bonds  

In
        April
        2005, we redeemed $195.7 million of outstanding securitization financing
        bonds
        as discussed above, utilizing cash on hand of $25.0 million and $170.7 million
        in repurchase agreements to finance the purchase. The bonds continue to remain
        outstanding and serve as collateral for the repurchase agreement borrowings.
        During 2005, payments of $37.6 million received on the bonds were used to
        paydown the repurchase agreement borrowings to their current balance of $133.1
        million at December 31, 2005. 

Repurchase
        Agreements Secured by Securities  

Repurchase
        agreements decreased from $70.4 million at December 31, 2004 to $0.2 million
        at
        December 31, 2005 resulting from $70.3 million of repayments. 

Shareholders 
        Equity  

Shareholders 
        equity increased from $148.8 million at December 31, 2004 to $149.4 million
        at
        December 31,   2005  .
        This
        increase of $0.6 million resulted from net income of $9.6 million, offset
        by a
        change in accumulated other comprehensive income of $3.7 million consisting
        of
        $4.3 million from the sale of certain available-for-sale investments, an
        increase of $0.6 million on interest-rate swap and synthetic interest-rate
        swap
        contracts from the realization of losses on settled contracts and deferred
        gains
        on the remaining hedge contracts, and by dividends declared and paid on shares
        of Series D Preferred Stock of $5.3 million. 

Supplemental
        Discussion of Investments  

We
        also
        manage our investment portfolio based on a net basis. Below is the net basis
        of
        our investments as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. Excluded from this table
        are
        cash and cash equivalents, other assets, and other liabilities. 

As
        the
        cash flows received on our investments is generally subordinate to the
        obligations under the associated financing of the investment, we evaluate
        and
        manage our investment portfolio based on our net capital invested in that
        particular investment. Net capital invested is generally defined as the cost
        basis of the investment net of the associated financing for that investment.
        For
        securitized finance receivables, because the securitization financing is
        recourse only to the finance receivables pledged and is, therefore, not our
        general obligation, the risk on our investment in securitized finance
        receivables from an economic point of view is limited to our net retained
        investment in the securitization trust. Below is the net basis of our
        investments as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. Included in the table is an
        estimate of the fair value of the our net investment. The fair value of our
        net
        investment in securitized finance receivables is based on the present value
        of
        the projected cash flow from the collateral, adjusted for the impact and
        assumed
        level of future prepayments and credit losses, less the projected principal
        and
        interest due on the securitization financing bonds owned by third parties.
        The
        fair value of securities is based on quotes obtained from third-party dealers,
        or from management estimates.

(1)   

Fair
                  values are based on dealer quotes, where dealer quotes are not
                  available
                  fair values are calculated as the net present value of expected
                  future
                  cash flows, discounted at 16%. Fair value also includes our capital
                  invested in redeemed securitization financing bonds. Expected cash
                  flows
                  were based on the forward LIBOR curve as of December 31, 2005,
                  and
                  incorporate the resetting of the interest rates on the adjustable
                  rate
                  assets to a level consistent with projected prevailing rates. Increases
                  or
                  decreases in interest rates and index levels from those used would
                  impact
                  the calculation of fair value, as would differences in actual prepayment
                  speeds and credit losses versus the assumptions set forth
                  above.

Calculated
                  as the net present value of expected future cash flows, discounted
                  at 16%.
                  Expected cash flows were based on the forward LIBOR curve as of
                  December
                  31, 2004, and incorporate the resetting of the interest rates on
                  the
                  adjustable rate assets to a level consistent with projected prevailing
                  rates. Increases or decreases in interest rates and index levels
                  from
                  those used would impact the calculation of fair value, as would
                  differences in actual prepayment speeds and credit losses versus
                  the
                  assumptions set forth above.  

Our
        net
        investment for 2005 increased versus 2004 as a result of the sale and
        derecognition of securitized finance receivables, the redemption of the
        securitization financing associated with the single-family mortgage loans
        (which
        was 

14 

financed
        with a combination of investable capital and repurchase financing), the
        repayment of repurchase agreement financing on our securities portfolio,
        and the
        sale of certain equity investments. The repayment of repurchase agreement
        financing was for liquidity management purposes, and we expect to be able
        to
        borrow these amounts in the future if necessary.  

The
        following table summarizes the assumptions used in estimating fair value
        for our
        net investment in securitized finance receivables and the cash flow related
        to
        those net investments during   2005  .

          (2)        Includes
        loans pledged to three different securitization trusts.

RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS   

Comparative
        information on our results of operations is provided in the tables
        below: 

15 

2005
        Compared to 2004  

Net
        income increased in 2005 by $13.0 million, to $9.6 million in 2005 from a
        loss
        of $3.4 million in 2004, as a result of a decrease in provision for loan
        losses
        of $12.7 million, decreased impairment charges of $12.3 million, decreased
        general and administrative expenses of $2.1 million and $2.0 million of other
        income. These increases in income were partially offset by a decrease of
        net
        interest income of $11.4 million and a decrease in gain on sales of investments
        of $4.9 million. Net income to common shareholders increased by $9.4 million
        in
        2005, from a loss of $5.2 million in 2004 to income of $4.2 million in 2005.
        The
        increase in net income to common shareholders was due to increased net income
        of
        $9.6 million, offset by an increase in preferred stock charges of $3.5 million.

Net
        interest income for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased to $11.9 million,
        from $23.3 million for the same period in 2004. Net interest income decreased
        $11.4 million, or 48.9%, as a result of a decline in average interest-earning
        assets and a decrease in the net interest spread on interest-earning assets.
        Average interest earning assets decreased in 2005 due to the sale of
        investments, including $370.1 million of securitized finance receivables,
        $7.3
        million of equity securities and $1.7 million of other loans. Net interest
        spread was 0.26% in 2005 versus 1.00% in 2004, and decreased in 2005 as a
        result
        of sales and prepayments of higher coupon assets, the proceeds of which have
        been reinvested in lower-yielding cash equivalents, and also decreased due
        in
        part to increasing borrowing costs from both increasing LIBOR rates and
        repayment of lower-cost securitization financing bonds pursuant to the terms
        of
        the securitization trust. See further discussion below as to changes in the
        net
        interest spread on our investment portfolio during 2005. 

Net
        interest income after provision for loan losses increased as a result of
        the
        decline of the provision for loan losses in 2005 compared to 2004 of $12.7
        million. Provision for loan losses decreased to $5.8 million in 2005, from
        $18.5
        million in 2004. The decrease of $12.7 million from 2004 was primarily due
        to
        the sale in late 2004 and early 2005 of our investment in manufactured housing
        loans. Provision for manufactured housing loan losses decreased by $15.4
        million
        in 2005 while commercial and single family loan loss reserve provisions
        increased by $2.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively.  

Impairment
        charges decreased from $14.8 million in 2004 to $2.5 million in 2005. Impairment
        charges for 2004 included $9.1 million on manufactured housing loan securities
        and $4.9 million on delinquent property tax receivable securities. No impairment
        charges were recorded on manufactured housing securities as a result of their
        sale in 2005. Impairment charges in 2005 included $1.7 million on a debt
        security collateralized by delinquent property tax receivables. 

Gain
        on
        sale of investments for 2005 resulted primarily from a net gain of $8.2 million
        recognized on the sale of our interests in securitization trusts collateralized
        primarily by manufactured housing loans and securities backed by manufactured
        housing loans, for cash proceeds of $8.0 million.  The sale of our
        interests in those securitizations resulted in the derecognition of
        approximately $367.2 million of securitized finance receivables and $363.9
        million of related securitization financing.  We also recorded a gain of
        $1.4 million on the sale of approximately $2.0 million in mezzanine loans
        for
        net proceeds of $3.4 million.  

General
        and administrative expense decreased by $2.0 million from $7.7 million to
        $5.7
        million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively.
        General and administrative expenses decreased during 2005 with the sale in
        October 2004 of the Ohio delinquent property tax receivable servicing operation
        and through continued downsizing in the operation. General and Administrative
        expenses in 2004 included $1.0 million of litigation related expenses versus
        $0.8 million in 2005. General and Administrative expenses in 2005 included
        approximately $291 increase in professional fees related to the audit of
        our
        2004 financial statements and the subsequent termination of our independent
        accounting firm.  

We
        reported a preferred stock charge of $5.3 million for the year ended December
        31, 2005, which represents an increase of $3.5 million from the $1.8 million
        reported for the year ended December 31, 2004. Preferred stock charge for
        2005
        includes a full year s dividend on the Series D preferred stock. In 2004,
        dividends on the preferred stock outstanding was partially offset by the
        preferred stock benefit resulting from the recapitalization completed in
        2004. 

2004
        Compared to 2003  

Net
        loss
        decreased in 2004 by $17.7 million, to $3.4 million in 2004 from a loss of
        $21.1
        million in 2003, as a result of an increase in net interest income after
        provision for loan losses of $2.9 million and an increase in gain on sales
        of
        investments of $12.9 million. Net loss to common shareholders decreased by
        $9.1
        million in 2004, from $14.3 million in 2003 to $5.2 million in 2004. The
        improvement in net loss to common shareholders was due to reduced net loss
        of
        $17.7 

16 

million,
        offset by the reduction in preferred stock benefit of $8.7 million. The
        preferred stock benefit in 2003 resulted from the effects of a tender offer
        on
        the outstanding preferred stock completed in 2003 as compared to the net
        effect
        of the recapitalization of the preferred stock in 2004 and 2004 preferred
        stock
        dividends. 

Net
        interest income for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased to $23.3 million,
        from $39.0 million for the same period in 2003. Net interest income decreased
        $15.7 million, or 40.3%, as a result of a decline in average interest-earning
        assets and a decrease in the net interest spread on interest-earning assets.
        Net
        interest spread decreased in 2003 as a result of prepayments of higher coupon
        assets, the proceeds of which have been reinvested in lower-yielding cash
        equivalents, and also decreased due in part to increasing borrowing costs
        from
        both increasing LIBOR rates and repayment of lower-cost securitization financing
        bonds pursuant to the terms of the securitization trust. See further discussion
        below as to changes in the net interest spread on our investment portfolio
        during 2004. 

Net
        interest income after provision for loan losses increased as a result of
        the
        decline of the provision for loan losses in 2004 compared to 2003 of $18.6
        million. Provision for loan losses decreased to $18.5 million in 2004, from
        $37.1 million in 2003. The decrease of $18.6 million from 2003 was primarily
        due
        to $14.4 million of provision for loan losses recorded during the second
        quarter
        of 2003 specifically for currently existing credit losses within outstanding
        manufactured housing loans that were current as to payment but which we had
        determined to be impaired. The remaining $4.2 million of the decrease was
        primarily due to a decrease in the estimated losses on commercial and
        manufactured housing loans.  

Impairment
        charges decreased from $16.4 million in 2003 to $14.8 million in 2004.
        Impairment charges in 2004 included $9.1 million on a debt security
        collateralized by manufactured housing loans and $4.9 million on a debt security
        collateralized by delinquent property tax receivables. Other-than-temporary
        impairment charges were recorded as a result of the carrying value of the
        debt
        securities referenced above exceeded their estimated fair value and we
        determined that the carrying value would likely exceed the fair value for
        the
        foreseeable future. Impairment charges for 2003 included $5.5 million on
        manufactured housing loan securities and $10.4 million on delinquent property
        tax receivable securities. 

Gain
        on
        sale of investments for 2004 included a $17.6 million gain from the sale
        of
        securitized finance receivables with a carrying value of $219.2 million,
        net of
        allowance for loan losses of $16.2 million, and the de-recognition of the
        associated securitization financing bonds with a carrying amount of $226.7
        million. We received a net $11.9 million in proceeds from the sale of these
        receivables. This gain was partially offset by a $3.2 million loss on the
        sale
        of our Ohio delinquent property tax receivable investment.  

We
        reported a preferred stock charge of $1.8 million for the year ended December
        31, 2004, which represents a decline of $8.6 million from the preferred stock
        benefit of $6.8 million reported for the year ended December 31, 2003. This
        decrease in the preferred stock (charge) benefit was due to the recapitalization
        completed in 2004 and the tender offer completed in 2003 described in more
        detail above.

Average
        Balances and Effective Interest
        Rates   

The
        following table summarizes the average balances of interest-earning assets
        and
        their average effective yields, along with the average interest-bearing
        liabilities and the related average effective interest rates, for each of
        the
        periods presented. Assets that are on non-accrual status are excluded from
        the
        table below for each period presented. 

(1)        Average
        balances exclude adjustments made in accordance with SFAS No. 115,  Accounting
        for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,  to record available for
        sale securities at fair value.  

          (2)        Average
        balances exclude funds held by trustees of $2,149, $342,and $374 for the
        years
        ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.  

          (3)        Effective
        rates are calculated excluding non-interest related non-recourse securitization
        financing expenses and provision for credit losses    .  

2005
        compared to 2004  

The
        net
        interest spread for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased to 26 basis
        points from 100 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2004. This decrease
        in the net interest spread is due to declining yields on interest-earning
        assets, due principally to decreased interest income as a result of the sale
        of
        approximately $370.1 million of securitized finance receivables during the
        second quarter of 2005 and the sale of approximately $219.2 million in
        receivables during the fourth quarter of 2004. The net interest spread
        contribution for the receivables sold was 2 basis points and 18 basis points
        for
        the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2005 and 18 basis points
        and 37 basis points, respectively during the three and twelve month periods
        ended December 31, 2004. The proceeds from the sale of these investments
        have
        generally been invested in cash and short-term securities. In addition during
        2005, the securitization financing that backed variable-rate single family
        loans
        was replaced with LIBOR-based repurchase agreement financing, which is recourse
        to us, and which carries a weighted average spread to LIBOR of 10 basis points.
        The securitization financing had an effective spread to LIBOR of 32 basis
        points.   The
        net
        interest spread reflects the reduce yield on increased investments in cash
        and
        cash equivalents and also reflects the amortization of premiums and discounts
        on
        both the assets and the liabilities.  

The
        overall yield on interest-earnings assets, decreased to 7.01% for the year
        ended
        December 31, 2005 from 7.34% for the same period in 2004. The overall yield
        declined by 33 basis points as higher rate loans continued to be prepaid
        during
        the period. In addition to declining asset yields, interest-bearing liability
        costs increased from 6.34% to 6.75% as a result of the overall increase in
        market interest rates, including LIBOR rates, and the repayment of lower-cost
        securitization financing bonds pursuant to the terms of the securitization
        trust. Approximately 20% of our interest-bearing liabilities re-price monthly
        and are indexed to one-month LIBOR, which averaged 3.39% for 2005, compared
        to
        1.50% for 2004.  

2004
        compared to 2003  

The
        net
        interest spread for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased to 1.00% from
        1.65% for the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease can be generally
        attributed to the prepayment of higher coupon investments,
        principally 

18 

securitized
        finance receivables, and the resulting reinvestment of net proceeds available
        as
        a result of these prepayments into lower yielding cash and cash equivalents.
        In
        addition, net interest spread declined approximately 0.17% from the non-accrual
        status of a delinquent property tax receivable in 2004 compared to 2003,
        and
        declined approximately 0.07% as a result of net asset premium and bond discount
        amortization expense from the unexpected prepayment of approximately $98.0
        million in commercial mortgage loans during 2004. The overall yield on
        interest-earnings assets, decreased to 7.34% for the year ended December
        31,
        2004 from 7.53% for the same period in 2003. The overall yield declined by
        0.17%
        as a result of the non-accrual status in 2004 of a delinquent property tax
        receivable security, with the balance of the decline due to the prepayment
        of
        higher coupon investments. In addition to declining asset yields,
        interest-bearing liability costs increased from 5.88% to 6.34% as a result
        of
        the overall increase in market interest rates, including LIBOR rates, and
        the
        repayment of lower-cost securitization financing bonds pursuant to the terms
        of
        the securitization trust. Approximately 38% of our interest-bearing liabilities
        re-price monthly and are indexed to one-month LIBOR, which averaged 1.50%
        for
        2004, compared to 1.21% for 2003. In addition, interest bearing liability
        costs
        increased by approximately a net 0.04% for bond discount amortization resulting
        from the prepayment of approximately $98.0 million of securitization financing
        related to commercial loans which prepaid during the year. 

The
        following table summarizes the amount of change in interest income and interest
        expense due to changes in interest rates versus changes in volume: 

Note:       The
        change in interest income and interest expense due to changes in both volume
        and
        rate, which cannot be segregated, has been allocated proportionately to the
        change due to volume and the change due to rate. This table excludes
        non-interest related securitization financing expense, other interest expense
        and provision for credit losses.  

Credit
        Exposures  

As
        discussed in Item 1 above, our predominate securitization structure is
        non-recourse securitization financing, whereby loans and securities are pledged
        to a trust, and the trust issues bonds pursuant to an indenture. Generally,
        these securitization structures use over-collateralization, subordination,
        third-party guarantees, reserve funds, bond insurance, mortgage pool insurance
        or any combination of the foregoing as a form of credit enhancement. From
        an
        economic point of view, we generally have retained a limited portion of the
        direct credit risk in these structures. In many instances, we retained the
         first-loss  credit risk on pools of loans and securities that we have
        securitized. Apart from these investments, we have not otherwise retained
        material amounts of credit risk. 

The
        following table summarizes the aggregate principal amount of our investments
        in
        securitized finance receivables and subordinate securities; the direct credit
        exposure retained by us from those investments (represented by the amount
        of
        over-collateralization pledged and subordinated securities owned by us),
        net of
        the credit reserves and discounts maintained by us for such exposure; and
        the
        actual credit losses incurred for each year. Our credit exposure, net of
        credit
        reserves has sequentially decreased from year-to-year as a result of the
        sale
        and derecognition of investments, and as a result of additional provisions
        for
        loan losses on loans where we have credit risk. From 2003 to 2005, we sold
        or
        assets were otherwise paid down by $1,097 million, resulting in the reduction
        of
        our credit risk by $37.2 million.

        Reserves and Actual Credit Losses   

($
        in
        millions)  

The
        following tables summarize single-family mortgage loan and commercial mortgage
        loan delinquencies as a percentage of the outstanding commercial securitized
        finance receivables balance for those securities in which we have retained
        a
        portion of the direct credit risk. The delinquencies as a percentage of all
        outstanding securitized finance receivables balance have decreased to 7.0%
        at
        December 31, 2005 from 8.2% at December 31, 2004 primarily as a result of
        certain commercial loans that were delinquent in 2004 being paid-off during
        2005
        and the continued strong performance of the residential real estate market.
        We
        monitor and evaluate our exposure to credit losses and have established reserves
        based upon anticipated losses, general economic conditions and trends in
        the
        investment portfolio. At December 31, 2005, management believes the level
        of
        credit reserves is appropriate for currently existing losses. 

Single
        family mortgage loan delinquencies as a percentage of the outstanding loan
        balance decreased by approximately 1.2% to 7.50% at December 31, 2005 from
        8.71%
        at December 31, 2004. The decline in delinquencies is primarily due to the
        continued strong performance of the residential real estate market during
        the
        2005. The following table provides the percentage of delinquent single family
        loans at December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. 

Single-Family
        Loan Delinquency Statistics   

For
        commercial mortgage loans, the delinquencies as a percentage of the outstanding
        securitized finance receivables balance have decreased to 6.90% at December
        31,
        2005 from 7.96% at December 31, 2004 primarily due to five commercial loans
        which prepaid during 2005, which was partially offset by two loans that became
        delinquent in 2005.

CRITICAL
        ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
        discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations
        are
        based in large part upon our consolidated financial statements, which have
        been
        prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
        United States of America. The preparation of the financial statements requires
        management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
        of
        assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
        at
        the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
        and
        expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those
        estimates. 

Critical
        accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant
        judgments or uncertainties, and which may result in materially different
        results
        under different assumptions and conditions, or the application of which may
        have
        a material impact on our financial statements. The following are our critical
        accounting policies. 

Consolidation
        of Subsidiaries.    The
        consolidated financial statements represent our accounts after the elimination
        of inter-company transactions. We consolidate entities in which we own more
        than
        50% of the voting equity and control of the entity does not rest with others.
        We
        follow the equity method of accounting for investments with greater than
        20% and
        less than a 50% interest in partnerships and corporate joint ventures or
        when we
        are able to influence the financial and operating policies of the investee
        but
        own less than 50% of the voting equity. For all other investments, the cost
        method is applied.    

Impairments.
           We
        evaluate all securities in our investment portfolio for other-than-temporary
        impairments. A security is generally defined to be other-than-temporarily
        impaired if, for a maximum period of three consecutive quarters, the carrying
        value of such security exceeds its estimated fair value and we estimate,
        based
        on projected future cash flows or other fair value determinants, that the
        fair
        value will remain below the carrying value for the foreseeable future. If
        an
        other-than-temporary impairment is deemed to exist, we record an impairment
        charge to adjust the carrying value of the security down to its estimated
        fair
        value. In certain instances, as a result of the other-than-temporary impairment
        analysis, the recognition or accrual of interest will be discontinued and
        the
        security will be placed on non-accrual status. 

We
        consider an investment to be impaired if the fair value of the investment
        is
        less than its recorded cost basis. Impairments of other investments are
        generally considered to be other-than-temporary when the fair value remains
        below the carrying value for three consecutive quarters. If the impairment
        is
        determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in
        order
        to adjust the carrying value of the investment to its estimated
        value. 

Allowance
        for Loan Losses.   
        We have
        credit risk on loans pledged in securitization financing transactions and
        classified as securitized finance receivables in our investment portfolio.
        An
        allowance for loan losses has been estimated and established for currently
        existing probable losses. Factors considered in establishing an allowance
        include current loan delinquencies, historical cure rates of delinquent loans,
        and historical and anticipated loss severity of the loans as they are
        liquidated. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated and adjusted periodically
        by management based on the actual and estimated timing and amount of probable
        credit losses, using the above factors, as well as industry loss experience.
        Where loans are considered homogeneous, the allowance for losses is established
        and evaluated on a pool basis. Otherwise, the allowance for losses is
        established and evaluated on a loan-specific basis. Provisions made to increase
        the allowance are a current period expense to operations. Single-family loans
        are considered impaired when they are 60-days past due. Commercial mortgage
        loans are evaluated on an individual basis for impairment. Generally, a
        commercial loan with a debt service coverage ratio of less than one is
        considered impaired. However, based on a commercial loan s details, commercial
        loans with a debt service ratio less than one may not be considered impaired;
        conversely, commercial loans with a debt service coverage ratio greater than
        one
        may be considered impaired. Certain of the commercial mortgage loans are
        covered
        by loan guarantees that limit our exposure on these loans. The level of
        allowance for loan losses required for these loans is reduced by the amount
        of
        applicable loan guarantees. Our actual credit losses may differ from the
        estimates used to establish the allowance.

LIQUIDITY
        AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

We
        have
        historically financed our operations from a variety of sources. Our primary
        source of funding for our operations today is the cash flow generated from
        the
        investment portfolio, which includes net interest income and principal payments
        and prepayments on these investments. From the cash flow on our investment
        portfolio, we fund our operating overhead costs, including the servicing
        of our
        delinquent property tax receivables, pay the dividend on the Series D preferred
        stock and service the remaining recourse debt. Our investment portfolio
        continues to provide positive cash flow, which can be utilized by us for
        reinvestment or other purposes. We have utilized our cash flow to repay recourse
        debt outstanding and to purchase loans and securities for our investment
        portfolio. 

The
        cash
        flow from our investment portfolio for the year and quarter ended December
        31,
        2005 was approximately $31.4 million and $9.4 million, respectively, excluding
        proceeds from the sales of investments and the above refunding of repurchase
        agreements. Such cash flow is after payment of principal and interest on
        the
        associated non-recourse securitization financing (   i.e.   ,
        non-recourse debt) outstanding. We also sold investments in 2005 which generated
        net cash proceeds of $19.8 million.  

Excluding
        any cash flow derived from the sale or re-securitization of assets, and assuming
        that short-term interest rates remain stable, we anticipate that the cash
        flow
        from our investment portfolio will continue to decline in 2006 compared to
        2005
        as the investment portfolio continues to pay down absent reinvestment of
        our
        capital. We anticipate, however, that we will have sufficient cash flow from
        our
        investment portfolio to meet all of our obligations on both a short-term
        and
        long-term basis. 

Our
        cash
        flow from our investment portfolio is subject to fluctuation due to changes
        in
        interest rates, repayment rates and default rates and related losses. We
        currently have a substantial portion of our available capital invested in
        cash
        or highly liquid, short-term instruments. At December 31, 2005, this amount
        was
        $45.2 million, which represents a significant portion of our overall equity
        capital base. We intend to maintain high levels of liquidity for the foreseeable
        future given the lack of compelling reinvestment opportunities as a result
        of
        the absolute low level of interest rates, the flat yield curve, and the
        historically tight spreads on fixed income instruments.  

We
        redeemed 25% of our Series D Preferred Stock in January 2006. This redemption
        reduced the Series D Preferred Stock outstanding by approximately $14 million,
        saving us approximately $1.3 million in dividends annually. The Board of
        Directors of Dynex also approved the redemption of up to one million shares
        of
        common stock of Dynex upon completion of the redemption of the Series D
        Preferred Stock. The redemption of any shares of common stock is likely to
        occur
        if alternative uses of the capital are not available and if accretive to
        book
        value per common share. Upon completion of the redemption of the Preferred
        Stock, we will have an estimated $46 million in remaining investable
        capital. 

Through
        limited-purpose finance subsidiaries, we have issued non-recourse debt in
        the
        form of non-recourse securitization financing to fund the majority of our
        investment portfolio. The obligations under the securitization financing
        are
        payable solely from the securitized finance receivables and are otherwise
        non-recourse to us. The maturity of each class of securitization financing
        is
        directly affected by the rate of principal prepayments on the related collateral
        and is not subject to margin call risk. Each series is also subject to
        redemption according to specific terms of the respective indentures, generally
        on the earlier of a specified date or when the remaining balance of the bonds
        equals 35% or less of the original principal balance of the bonds. At December
        31, 2005, we have $516.6 million of non-recourse securitization financing
        outstanding, all of which carries a fixed rate of interest. 

We
        redeemed approximately $195.7 million of securitization financing in the
        second
        quarter of 2005, financing the redemption of the bonds outstanding with cash
        of
        $25.0 million and repurchase agreement financing of $170.7 million. As a
        result
        of paydowns on the associated securitized finance receivables, the remaining
        balance of the securitization financing bonds at the end of 2005 was $153.5
        million. We were financing the remaining $153.5 million with cash of $20.4
        million and repurchase agreement financing of approximately $133.1 million.
        As
        the redeemed bonds have not been legally extinguished, we could reissue these
        bonds, generating estimated proceeds in excess of $153.5 million, which would
        be
        used to repay the repurchase agreement financing, and the balance of which
        would
        increase our cash and cash equivalents.

Contractual
        Obligations and
        Commitments  

The
        following table shows expected cash payments on our contractual obligations
        as
        of December 31, 2005 for the following time periods: 

(1)   

As
                  the master servicer for certain of the series of non-recourse
                  securitization financing securities which we have issued, and certain
                  loans which have been securitized but for which we are not the
                  master
                  servicer, we have an obligation to advance scheduled principal
                  and
                  interest on delinquent loans in accordance with the underlying
                  servicing
                  agreements should the primary servicer fail to make such advance.
                  Such
                  advance amounts are generally repaid in the same month as they
                  are made,
                  or shortly thereafter, and the contractual obligation with respect
                  to
                  these advances is excluded from the above
                  table.  

(2)   

Amounts
                  presented for Long-Term Debt Obligations include estimated principal
                  and
                  interest on the related
                  obligations.  

(3)   

Securitization
                  financing is non-recourse to us as the bonds are payable solely
                  from loans
                  and securities pledged as securitized finance receivables. Payments
                  due by
                  period were estimated based on the principal repayments forecast
                  for the
                  underlying loans and securities, substantially all of which is
                  used to
                  repay the associated securitization financing
                  outstanding.  

Off-Balance
        Sheet Arrangements  

We
        do not
        believe that any off-balance sheet arrangements exist that are reasonably
        likely
        to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes
        in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
        capital expenditures or capital resources.

Selected
        Quarterly Results  

The
        following tables present our unaudited selected quarterly results for 2005
        and
        2004. 

Summary
        of Selected Quarterly Results (unaudited)  

         (amounts
        in thousands except share and per share data     )   

(1)        Computed
        as net interest margin excluding non-interest non-recourse securitization
        financing expenses divided by average interest earning assets.  

          (2)        The
        increase in net income during the second quarter of 2005 relates primarily
        to
        the gain of approximately $8.2 million recognized on the sale of $367.2 million
        of manufactured housing loans and securities and the derecognition of the
        related non-recourse securitization financing of $363.9
        million.  

          (3)        The
        negative net interest spread on interest-earning assets resulted from the
        impact
        of certain commercial loans being on non-accrual and an increase in amortization
        expense related to deferred costs on our commercial securitizations resulting
        from higher than anticipated prepayments on those
        securitizations.

FORWARD-LOOKING
        STATEMENTS   

Certain
        written statements in this Form   10-K  
        made by
        Dynex that are not historical fact constitute  forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
        and
        Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements
        contained in this Item as well as those discussed elsewhere in this Report
        addressing the results of operations, our operating performance, events,
        or
        developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, including
        statements relating to investment strategies, net interest income growth,
        earnings or earnings per share growth, and market share, as well as statements
        expressing optimism or pessimism about future operating results, are
        forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are based upon
        management s views and assumptions as of the date of this Report, regarding
        future events and operating performance and are applicable only as of the
        dates
        of such statements. Such forward-looking statements may involve factors that
        could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results
        or
        from any results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
        Dynex
        cautions the public not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements,
        which may be based on assumptions and anticipated events that do not
        materialize. 

Factors
        that may cause actual results to differ from historical results or from any
        results expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include the
        following: 

Reinvestment.      Asset
        yields today are generally lower than those assets sold or repaid, due to
        lower
        overall interest rates and more competition for these assets. We have generally
        been unable to find investments which have acceptable risk adjusted yields.
        As a
        result, our net interest income has been declining, and may continue to decline
        in the future, resulting in lower earnings per share over time. In order
        to
        maintain our investment portfolio size and our earnings, we need to reinvest
        a
        portion of the cash flows we receive into new interesting earning assets.
        If we
        are unable to find suitable reinvestment opportunities, the net interest
        income
        on our investment portfolio and investment cash flows could be negatively
        impacted. 

Economic
        Conditions   .
        We are
        affected by general economic conditions. An increase in the risk of defaults
        and
        credit risk resulting from an economic slowdown or recession could result
        in a
        decrease in the value of our investments and the over-collateralization
        associated with its securitization transactions. As a result of our being
        heavily invested in short-term high quality investments, a worsening economy,
        however, could also benefit us by creating opportunities for us to invest
        in
        assets that become distressed as a result of the worsening conditions. These
        changes could have an effect on our financial performance and the performance
        on
        our securitized loan pools. 

Investment
        Portfolio Cash Flow   .
        Cash
        flows from the investment portfolio fund our operations, the preferred stock
        dividend, and repayments of outstanding debt, and are subject to fluctuation
        due
        to changes in interest rates, repayment rates and default rates and related
        losses, particularly given the high degree of internal structural leverage
        inherent in our securitized investments. Based on the performance of the
        underlying assets within the securitization structure, cash flows which may
        have
        otherwise been paid to us as a result of our ownership interest may be retained
        within the structure. Cash flows from the investment portfolio are likely
        to
        sequentially decline until we meaningfully begin to reinvest our capital.
        There
        can be no assurances that we will be able to find suitable investment
        alternatives for our capital, nor can there be assurances that we will meet
        our
        reinvestment and return hurdles. 

Defaults.
           Defaults
        by borrowers on loans we securitized may have an adverse impact on our financial
        performance, if actual credit losses differ materially from our estimates
        or
        exceed reserves for losses recorded in the financial statements. The allowance
        for loan losses is calculated on the basis of historical experience and
        management s best estimates. Actual default rates or loss severity may differ
        from our estimate as a result of economic conditions. Actual defaults on
        adjustable-rate mortgage loans may increase during a rising interest rate
        environment. In addition, commercial mortgage loans are generally large dollar
        balance loans, and a significant loan default may have an adverse impact
        on our
        financial results. Such impact may include higher provisions for loan losses
        and
        reduced interest income if the loan is placed on non-accrual. 

Interest
        Rate Fluctuations.   
        Our
        income and cash flow depends on our ability to earn greater interest on our
        investments than the interest cost to finance these investments. Interest
        rates
        in the markets served by us generally rise or fall with interest rates as
        a
        whole. Approximately $614 million of our investments, including loans and
        securities currently pledged as securitized finance receivables and securities,
        are fixed-rate and approximately $142 million of our investments are variable
        rate. We currently finance these fixed-rate assets through $516.5 million
        of
        fixed rate securitization financing and $133 million of variable rate repurchase
        agreements. The net interest spread for these investments could decrease
        during
        a 

25 

period
        of
        rapidly rising short-term interest rates, since the investments generally
        have
        interest rates which reset on a delayed basis and have periodic interest
        rate
        caps; the related borrowing has no delayed resets or such interest rate caps.

Third-party
        Servicers.   
        O  ur
        loans
        and loans underlying securities are serviced by third-party service providers.
        As with any external service provider, we are subject to the risks associated
        with inadequate or untimely services. Many borrowers require notices and
        reminders to keep their loans current and to prevent delinquencies and
        foreclosures. A substantial increase in our delinquency rate that results
        from
        improper servicing or loan performance in general could harm our ability
        to
        securitize our real estate loans in the future and may have an adverse effect
        on
        our earnings. 

Prepayments.   
        Prepayments by borrowers on loans we securitized may have an adverse impact
        on
        our financial performance. Prepayments are expected to increase during a
        declining interest rate or flat yield curve environment. Our exposure to
        rapid
        prepayments is primarily (i) the faster amortization of premium on the
        investments and, to the extent applicable, amortization of bond discount,
        and
        (ii) the replacement of investments in its portfolio with lower yielding
        investments. 

Competition.   
        The
        financial services industry is a highly competitive market in which we compete
        with a number of institutions with greater financial resources. In purchasing
        portfolio investments and in issuing securities, we compete with other mortgage
        REITs, investment banking firms, savings and loan associations, commercial
        banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, federal agencies and other
        entities, many of which have greater financial resources and a lower cost
        of
        capital than we do. Increased competition in the market and our competitors
        greater financial resources have adversely affected Dynex, and may continue
        to
        do so. Competition may also continue to keep pressure on spreads resulting
        in us
        being unable to reinvest our capital on an acceptable risk-adjusted
        basis. 

Regulatory
        Changes.   
        Our
        businesses as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 were not subject
        to
        any material federal or state regulation or licensing requirements. However,
        changes in existing laws and regulations or in the interpretation thereof,
        or
        the introduction of new laws and regulations, could adversely affect us and
        the
        performance of our securitized loan pools or our ability to collect on our
        delinquent property tax receivables. We are a REIT and are required to meet
        certain tests in order to maintain our REIT status as described in the earlier
        discussion of  Federal Income Tax Considerations.  If we should fail to maintain
        our REIT status, we would not be able to hold certain investments and would
        be
        subject to income taxes. 

Section
        404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002   .
        Based
        on our current market capitalization, we do not anticipate that we will be
        required to be compliant with the provisions of Section 404 of the
        Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in 2006. However, the measurement date for
        determining the compliance deadline is June 30, 2006. Failure to be compliant
        may result in doubt in the capital markets about the quality and adequacy
        of our
        internal disclosure controls. This could result in our having difficulty
        in or
        being unable to raise additional capital in these markets in order to finance
        our operations and future investments. 

Other.   
        The
        following risks, which are discussed in more detail in    Risk
        Factors   
        in Item
        1A above, could also affect our results of operations, financial condition
        and
        cash flows: 

We
                may be unable to invest in new assets with attractive yields, and
                yields
                on new assets in which we do invest may not generate attractive yields,
                resulting in a decline in our earnings per share over
                time. 

Our
                ownership of certain subordinate interests in securitization trusts
                subjects us to credit risk on the underlying loans, and we provide
                for
                loss reserves on these loans as required under GAAP.

Certain
                investments employ internal structural leverage as a result of the
                securitization process, and are in the most subordinate position
                in the
                capital structure, which magnifies the potential impact of adverse
                events
                on our cash flows and reported results.  

Our
                efforts to manage credit risk may not be successful in limiting
                delinquencies and defaults in underlying loans or losses on our
                investments. 

Prepayments
                of principal on our investments, and the timing of prepayments, may
                impact
                our reported earnings and our cash flows. 

We
                finance a portion of our investment portfolio with short-term recourse
                repurchase agreements which subjects us to margin calls if the assets
                pledged subsequently decline in value. 

We
                may be subject to the risks associated with inadequate or untimely
                services from third-party service providers, which may harm our results
                of
                operations.  

Interest
                rate fluctuations can have various negative effects on us, and could
                lead
                to reduced earnings and/or increased earnings
                volatility. 

Our
                reported income depends on accounting conventions and assumptions
                about
                the future that may change. 

Failure
                to qualify as a REIT would adversely affect our dividend distributions
                and
                could adversely affect the value of our
                securities. 

Maintaining
                REIT status may reduce our flexibility to manage our
                operations. 

We
                may fail to properly conduct our operations so as to avoid falling
                under
                the definition of an investment company pursuant to the Investment
                Company
                Act of 1940. 

We
                are dependent on certain key personnel. 

RECENT
        ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

In
        December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued SFAS No.
        123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (FAS 123R). This statement supersedes
        APB Opinion No. 25 and its related implementation guidance. The statement
        establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity
        exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services. This statement focuses
        primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee
        services in share-based payment transactions. The most significant change
        resulting from this statement is the requirement for public companies to
        expense
        employee share-based payments under fair value as originally introduced in
        SFAS
        No. 123. This statement is effective for public companies as of the beginning
        of
        the first annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005, or December
        15, 2005 for small business issuers. We will adopt this statement effective
        January 1, 2006 and do not expect the adoption of FAS 123R to have a material
        impact on our financial statements. 

In
        May
        2005, the FASB issued SFAS 154,  Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. 
SFAS 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a
        change in accounting principle. Previous guidance required that most voluntary
        changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income
        of the
        period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting
        principle. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods 
financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is
        impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative
        effect of the change. We do not believe SFAS 154 will have an impact on our
        financial statements. 

        In
        February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 155,  Accounting for Certain Hybrid
        Financial Instruments . Key provisions of SFAS 155 include: (1) a broad
        fair value measurement option for certain hybrid financial instruments that
        contain an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation;
        (2) clarification that only the simplest separations of interest payments
        and principal payments qualify for the exception afforded to interest-only
        strips and principal-only strips from derivative accounting under paragraph
        14
        of FAS 133 (thereby narrowing such exception); (3) a requirement that
        beneficial interests in securitized financial assets be analyzed to determine
        whether they are freestanding derivatives or whether they are hybrid instruments
        that contain embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation; (4) clarification
        that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded
        derivatives; and (5) elimination of the prohibition on a QSPE holding
        passive derivative financial instruments that pertain to beneficial interests
        that are or contain a derivative financial instrument. In general, these
        changes
        will reduce the operational complexity associated with bifurcating embedded
        derivatives, and increase the number of beneficial interests in securitization
        transactions, including interest-only strips and principal-only strips, required
        to be accounted for in accordance with FAS 133. We do not believe that SFAS
        155
        will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations,
        or liquidity. 

In
        March
        2006 the FASB issued SFAS No.156,  Accounting for Servicing of Financial
        Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140  (SFAS 156). This Statement amends
        FASB Statement No. 140,    Accounting
        for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
        Liabilities,    with
        respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and
        servicing liabilities. This Statement requires an entity to recognize a
        servicing asset or servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation
        to
        service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract in certain
        situations and to initially measure those servicing assets and servicing
        liabilities at fair value, if practicable. SFAS 156 permits an entity to
        measure
        each class of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities
        by either amortizing the servicing asset or liability and assessing the mortgage
        servicing asset or servicing liability for impairment at each reporting date.
        Alternatively, an entity may choose to measure the servicing asset or servicing
        liability at fair value at each reporting date and report changes in fair
        value
        in earnings in the period the changes occur. SFAS 156 permits, at its initial
        adoption, a one-time reclassification of available-for-sale securities to
        trading securities by entities with recognized servicing rights,
        without 

26 

calling
        into question the treatment of other available-for-sale securities under
        Statement 115, provided that the available-for-sale securities are identified
        in
        some manner as offsetting the entity s exposure to changes in fair value of
        servicing assets or servicing liabilities that a servicer elects to subsequently
        measure at fair value. This statement is effective as of the beginning of
        its
        first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. We are currently
        evaluating the potential impact this statement may have on our financial
        statements. 

ITEM
        7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
        RISK  

Market
        risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential
        change in the value of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in interest
        and foreign exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices. Market risk
        is
        inherent to both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, and
        accordingly, the scope of our market risk management extends beyond derivatives
        to include all market risk sensitive financial instruments. As a financial
        services company, net interest income comprises the primary component of
        our
        earnings and cash flows. We are subject to risk resulting from interest rate
        fluctuations to the extent that there is a gap between the amount of our
        interest-earning assets and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities that
        are
        prepaid, mature or re-price within specified periods. 

We
        monitor the aggregate cash flow, projected net yield and estimated market
        value
        of our investment portfolio under various interest rate and prepayment
        assumptions. While certain investments may perform poorly in an increasing
        or
        decreasing interest rate environment, other investments may perform well,
        and
        others may not be impacted at all. 

We
        focus
        on the sensitivity of our investment portfolio cash flow, and measures such
        sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates are defined
        as instantaneous, parallel, and sustained interest rate movements in 100
        basis
        point increments. We estimate our net interest income cash flow for the next
        twenty-four months assuming interest rates over such time period follow the
        forward LIBOR curve (based on 90-day Eurodollar futures contracts) as of
        December 31, 2005. Once the base case has been estimated, cash flows are
        projected for each of the defined interest rate scenarios. Those scenario
        results are then compared against the base case to determine the estimated
        change to cash flow. Cash flow changes from interest rate swaps, caps, floors
        or
        any other derivative instrument are included in this analysis. 

The
        following table summarizes our net interest income cash flow and market value
        sensitivity analyses as of December 31, 2005. These analyses represent
        management s estimate of the percentage change in net interest margin cash flow
        and value expressed as a percentage change of shareholders  equity, given a
        parallel shift in interest rates, as discussed above. Other investments are
        excluded from this analysis because they are not considered interest rate
        sensitive. The  Base  case represents the interest rate environment as it
        existed as of December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2005, one-month LIBOR was
        4.39% and six-month LIBOR was 4.70%. The analysis is heavily dependent upon
        the
        assumptions used in the model. The effect of changes in future interest rates,
        the shape of the yield curve or the mix of assets and liabilities may cause
        actual results to differ significantly from the modeled results. In addition,
        certain financial instruments provide a degree of  optionality.  The most
        significant option affecting our portfolio is the borrowers  option to prepay
        the loans. The model applies prepayment rate assumptions representing
        management s estimate of prepayment activity on a projected basis for each
        collateral pool in the investment portfolio. The model applies the same
        prepayment rate assumptions for all five cases indicated below. The extent
        to
        which borrowers utilize the ability to exercise their option may cause actual
        results to significantly differ from the analysis. Furthermore, the projected
        results assume no additions or subtractions to our portfolio,  

27 

and
        no
        change to our liability structure. Historically, there have been significant
        changes in our investment portfolio and the liabilities incurred by us. As
        a
        result of anticipated prepayments on assets in the investment portfolio,
        there
        are likely to be such changes in the future. 

Our
        interest rate risk is related both to the rate of change in short term interest
        rates and to the level of short-term interest rates. Approximately $614 million
        of our investment portfolio is comprised of loans or securities that have
        coupon
        rates that are fixed. Approximately $142 million of our investment portfolio
        as
        of December 31, 2005 was comprised of loans or securities that have coupon
        rates
        which adjust over time (subject to certain periodic and lifetime limitations)
        in
        conjunction with changes in short-term interest rates. Approximately 65%,
        13%
        and 12% of the adjustable-rate loans underlying our securitized finance
        receivables are indexed to and reset based upon the level of six-month LIBOR,
        one-year constant maturity treasury rate (CMT) and prime rate,
        respectively. 

Generally,
        during a period of rising short-term interest rates, our net interest income
        earned and the corresponding cash flow on our investment portfolio will
        decrease. The decrease of the net interest spread results from
        (i) fixed-rate loans and investments financed with variable-rate debt, (ii)
        the lag in resets of the adjustable-rate loans underlying the securitized
        finance receivables relative to the rate resets on the associated borrowings,
        and (iii) rate resets on the adjustable-rate loans which are generally
        limited to 1% every six months or 2% every twelve months and subject to lifetime
        caps, while the associated borrowings have no such limitation. As to item
        (i),
        we have substantially limited our interest rate risk by match funding fixed
        rate
        assets and variable rate assets. As to items (ii) and (iii), as short-term
        interest rates stabilize and the adjustable-rate loans reset, the net interest
        margin may be partially restored as the yields on the adjustable-rate loans
        adjust to market conditions. 

Net
        interest income may increase following a fall in short-term interest rates.
        This
        increase may be temporary as the yields on the adjustable-rate loans adjust
        to
        the new market conditions after a lag period. The net interest spread may
        also
        be increased or decreased by the proceeds or costs of interest rate swap,
        cap or
        floor agreements, to the extent that we have entered into such
        agreements.

ITEM
        9A.       CONTROLS
        AND PROCEDURES  

(a)      Evaluation
        of disclosure controls and procedures   . 

Disclosure
        controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed
        to
        ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or
        submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
        within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure
        controls and procedures include, without 

28 

limitation,
        controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
        disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
        communicated to management, including our management, as appropriate, to
        allow
        timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

As
        of the
        end of the period covered by this annual report, we carried out an evaluation
        of
        the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
        and
        procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. This evaluation
        was
        carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
        including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer.
        Based
        upon that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls
        and
        procedures are effective.  

In
        conducting its review of disclosure controls, management concluded that
        sufficient disclosure controls and procedures did exist to ensure that
        information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under
        the
        Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
        periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 

(b)      Changes
        in internal controls   . 

Our
        management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
        internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal
        controls or in other factors during the fourth quarter of 2005 that materially
        affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
        over financial reporting. There were also no significant deficiencies or
        material weaknesses in such internal controls requiring corrective
        actions.

REPORT

        Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

        Dynex
        Capital, Inc. 

        Glen
        Allen, Virginia 

We
          have
          audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Dynex Capital, Inc.
          ( Dynex ) as of December 31, 2005 and the related consolidated statements of
          operations, shareholders  equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These
          financial statements are the responsibility of Dynex s management. Our
          responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
          on
          our audit. 

We
          conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
          Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
          we plan
          and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
          financial
          statements are free of material misstatement. Dynex is not required to
          have, nor
          were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
          reporting.       Our
          audit
          included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as
          a basis
          for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
          but not
          for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Dynex s
          internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
          opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
          the
          amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
          principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
          evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
          our
          audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In
          our
          opinion, the 2005 consolidated financial statements referred to above present
          fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Dynex at December
          31, 2005, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
          year then
          ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
          United
          States of America.

REPORT

        Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

        Dynex
        Capital, Inc.

We
        have
        audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dynex Capital, Inc.
        and
        subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of December 31, 2004, and the related
        consolidated statements of operations, shareholders  equity, and cash flows for
        each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2004. These financial
        statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our
        responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based
        on our
        audits. 

We
        conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
        statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required
        to
        have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
        financial reporting.       Our
        audit
        included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
        basis
        for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
        but not
        for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
        internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
        opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
        the
        amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
        principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
        evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
        our
        audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In
        our
        opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
        respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2004 and
        2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
        the
        three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting
        principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTE
        1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

Basis
        of Presentation  

The
        accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
        with the instructions to Form 10-K and include all of the information and
        notes
        required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
        of
        America, hereinafter referred to as  generally accepted accounting principles, 
for complete financial statements. The consolidated financial statements
        include
        the accounts of Dynex Capital, Inc. and its qualified real estate investment
        trust ( REIT ) subsidiaries and taxable REIT subsidiary ( Dynex  or the
 Company ). All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in
        consolidation of Dynex. 

Dynex
        believes it has complied with the requirements for qualification as a REIT
        under
        the Internal Revenue Code (the  Code ). As such, Dynex believes that it
        qualifies as a REIT, and it generally will not be subject to federal income
        tax
        on the amount of its income or gain that is distributed as dividends to
        shareholders. 

Dynex
        uses estimates in establishing fair value for its securities as discussed
        in
        Note 2. 

Dynex
        also has credit risk on certain investments in its portfolio as discussed
        in
        Note 4. An allowance for loan losses has been estimated and established for
        currently existing losses based on management s judgment. The allowance for loan
        losses is evaluated and adjusted periodically by management based on the
        actual
        and estimated timing and amount of currently existing credit losses. Provisions
        made to increase the allowance related to credit risk are presented as provision
        for loan losses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
        Dynex s actual credit losses may differ from those estimates used to establish
        the allowance. 

Certain
        amounts for 2003 and 2004 have been reclassified to conform to the presentation
        adopted in 2005. 

NOTE
        2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Consolidation
        of Subsidiaries  

The
        consolidated financial statements represent Dynex s accounts after the
        elimination of inter-company transactions. Dynex consolidates entities in
        which
        it owns more than 50% of the voting equity and control does not rest with
        others. Dynex follows the equity method of accounting for investments with
        greater than 20% and less than a 50% interest in partnerships and corporate
        joint ventures or when it is able to influence the financial and operating
        policies of the investee but owns less than 50% of the voting equity. For
        all
        other investments, the cost method is applied.    

Federal
        Income Taxes  

Dynex
        believes it has complied with the requirements for qualification as a REIT
        under
        the Internal Revenue Code (the  Code ). As such, Dynex believes that it
        qualifies as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and it generally will
        not
        be subject to federal income tax on the amount of its income or gain that
        is
        distributed as dividends to shareholders. Dynex uses the calendar year for
        both
        tax and financial reporting purposes. There may be differences between taxable
        income and income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally
        accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). Dynex has a cumulative tax
        net operating loss carryforward of $134,519 as of December 31, 2004 and
        anticipates reporting a tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2005 but
        has
        not yet finalized the related calculations.

Investments 

Securitized
        Finance Receivables.   
        Securitized finance receivables consist of collateral pledged to support
        the
        repayment of non-recourse securitization financing issued by Dynex. Loans
        included in securitized finance receivables are reported at amortized cost.
        An
        allowance has been established for currently existing losses on such loans.
        Debt
        securities included in securitized finance receivables are considered
        available-for-sale and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains
        and
        losses excluded from earnings and reported in accumulated other comprehensive
        income. The basis for any gain/loss on any debt securities sold is computed
        using the specific identification method. Securitized finance receivables
        can
        only be sold subject to the lien of the respective securitization financing
        indenture.

        Investments.

        investments may include unsecuritized delinquent property tax receivables,
        securities backed by delinquent property tax receivables, and real estate
        owned.
        The unsecuritized delinquent property tax receivables are carried at amortized
        cost. S  ecurities
        backed by delinquent property tax receivables are classified as
        available-for-sale and are carried at fair value.  

Other
        investments also include real estate owned acquired through, or in lieu of
        foreclosure in connection with the servicing of the delinquent tax lien
        receivables portfolio. Such investments are considered held for sale and
        are
        initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell ( net realizable value ) at
        the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to
        foreclosure, management periodically performs valuations and adjusts the
        property to the lower of cost and net realizable value. Revenue and expenses
        related to and changes in the valuation of the real estate owned are included
        in
        other income (expense). 

Securities.
           Securities
        include debt and equity securities, which are considered available-for-sale
        under SFAS No. 115 and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains
        and
        losses excluded from earnings and reported as accumulated other comprehensive
        income. The basis used to determine the gain or loss on any debt and equity
        securities sold is the specific identification method and average cost method,
        respectively. 

Other
        loans   .
        Other
        loans are carried at amortized cost. 

Interest
        Income.   
        Interest
        income is recognized when earned according to the terms of the underlying
        investment and when, in the opinion of management, it is collectible. For
        loans,
        the accrual of interest is discontinued when, in the opinion of management,
        the
        interest is not collectible in the normal course of business, when the loan
        is
        significantly past due or when the primary servicer of the loan fails to
        advance
        the interest and/or principal due on the loan. For securities and other
        investments, the accrual of interest is discontinued when, in the opinion
        of
        management, it is probable that all amounts contractually due will not be
        collected. Loans are considered past due when the borrower fails to make
        a
        timely payment in accordance with the underlying loan agreement, inclusive
        of
        all applicable cure periods. All interest accrued but not collected for
        investments that are placed on a non-accrual status or are charged-off is
        reversed against interest income. Interest on these investments is accounted
        for
        on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to
        accrual status. Investments are returned to accrual status when all the
        principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and
        future
        payments are reasonably assured. 

Premiums,
        Discounts and Hedging Basis Adjustments  

Premiums
        and discounts on investments and obligations are amortized into interest
        income
        or expense, respectively, over the life of the related investment or obligation
        using the effective yield method. Hedging basis adjustments on associated
        debt
        obligations are amortized over the expected remaining life of the debt
        instrument. If the indenture for a particular debt obligation provides for
        a
        step-up of interest rates on the optional redemption date for that obligation
        and Dynex has the ability and intent to exercise its call option, then premiums,
        discounts, and deferred hedging losses are amortized to that optional redemption
        date. Otherwise, these amounts are amortized over the estimated remaining
        life
        of the obligation.

Debt
        Issuance Costs 

Costs
        incurred in connection with the issuance of non-recourse debt and recourse
        debt
        are deferred and amortized over the estimated lives of their respective debt
        obligations using the effective yield method.  

Derivative
        Financial Instruments  

On
        occasion, Dynex may enter into interest rate swap agreements, interest rate
        cap
        agreements, interest rate floor agreements, financial forwards, financial
        futures and options on financial futures ( Interest Rate Agreement ) to manage
        its sensitivity to changes in interest rates. These interest rate agreements
        are
        intended to provide income and cash flow to offset potential reduced net
        interest income and cash flow under certain interest rate environments. At
        the
        inception of the Interest Rate Agreement, these instruments are designated
        as
        either hedge positions or trading positions using criteria established in
        SFAS
        No. 133,  Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  (as
        amended). If, at the inception of the Interest Rate Agreement, formal
        documentation is prepared that describes the risk being hedged, identifies
        the
        hedging instrument and the means to be used for assessing the effectiveness
        of
        the hedge and if it can be demonstrated that the hedging instrument will
        be
        highly effective at hedging the risk exposure, the derivative instrument
        will be
        designated as a cash flow hedge position. Otherwise, the Interest Rate Agreement
        will be classified as a trading position. 

For
        Interest Rate Agreements designated as cash flow hedges, Dynex evaluates
        the
        effectiveness of these hedges against the financial instrument being hedged.
        The
        effective portion of the hedge relationship on an interest rate agreement
        designated as a cash flow hedge is reported in accumulated other comprehensive
        income, and the ineffective portion of such hedge is reported in income.
        Amounts
        in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings
        in the
        same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Derivative
        instruments are carried at fair value in the financial statements of
        Dynex. 

As
        a part
        of Dynex s interest rate risk management process, Dynex may be required
        periodically to terminate hedge instruments. Any basis adjustments or changes
        in
        the fair value of hedges recorded in other comprehensive income are recognized
        into income or expense in conjunction with the original hedge or hedged
        exposure.  

If
        the
        underlying asset, liability or commitment is sold or matures, the hedge is
        deemed partially or wholly ineffective, or the criteria that was executed
        at the
        time the hedge instrument was entered into no longer exists, the interest
        rate
        agreement no longer qualifies as a designated hedge. Under these circumstances,
        such changes in the market value of the interest rate agreement are recognized
        in current income. 

For
        interest rate agreements entered into for trading purposes, realized and
        unrealized changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in the
        consolidated statements of operations as trading income or loss in the period
        in
        which the changes occur or when such trade instruments are settled. Amounts
        receivable from counter-parties, if any, are included on the consolidated
        balance sheets in other assets. 

Cash
        Equivalents  

Cash
        and
        cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments with
        original maturities of three months or less. 

Net
        Income Per Common Share  

Net
        income per common share is presented on both a basic net income per common
        share
        and diluted net income per common share basis. Diluted net income per common
        share assumes the conversion of the convertible preferred stock into common
        stock, using the if-converted method, and stock appreciation rights, using
        the
        treasury stock method, but only if these items are dilutive. Each share of
        preferred stock is convertible into one share of common stock.

Use
        of
        Estimates 

The
        preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles
        generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to
        make
        estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
        liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
        of
        the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
        during
        the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
        primary estimates inherent in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
        are discussed below. 

Fair
        Value.    Securities
        classified as available-for-sale are carried in the accompanying financial
        statements at estimated fair value. Estimates of fair value for securities
        may
        be based on market prices provided by certain dealers. Estimates of fair
        value
        for certain other securities are determined by calculating the present value
        of
        the projected cash flows of the instruments using estimates of market-based
        discount rates, prepayment rates and credit loss assumptions. The estimate
        of
        fair value for securities pledged as securitized finance receivables is
        determined by calculating the present value of the projected cash flows of
        the
        instruments, using discount rates, prepayment rate assumptions and credit
        loss
        assumptions based on historical experience and estimated future activity,
        and
        using discount rates commensurate with those Dynex believes would be used
        by
        third parties in a market purchase.  

Estimates
        of fair value for financial instruments are based primarily on management s
        judgment. Since the fair value of Dynex s financial instruments  
        is based
        on estimates, actual fair values recognized may differ from those estimates
        recorded in the consolidated financial statements. The fair value of all
        financial instruments is presented in Note 10. 

Allowance
        for Loan Losses.    An
        allowance for loan losses has been estimated and established for currently
        existing probable losses for loans in Dynex s investment portfolio. Factors
        considered in establishing an allowance include current loan delinquencies,
        historical cure rates of delinquent loans, and historical and anticipated
        loss
        severity of the loans as they are liquidated. The allowance for losses is
        evaluated and adjusted periodically by management based on the actual and
        estimated timing and amount of probable credit losses, using the above factors,
        as well as industry loss experience. Where loans are considered homogeneous,
        the
        allowance for losses are established and evaluated on a pool basis. Otherwise,
        the allowance for losses is established and evaluated on a loan-specific
        basis.
        Provisions made to increase the allowance are charged as a current period
        expense. Single-family loans are considered impaired when they are 60-days
        past
        due. Commercial mortgage loans are evaluated on an individual basis for
        impairment. Commercial mortgage loans are secured by income-producing real
        estate and is evaluated for impairment when the debt service coverage ratio
        on
        the loan is less than 1:1. Certain of the commercial mortgage loans are covered
        by loan guarantees that limit Dynex s exposure on these loans. The level of
        allowance for loan losses required for these loans is reduced by the amount
        of
        applicable loan guarantees. Dynex s actual credit losses may differ from the
        estimates used to establish the allowance. 

Impairments.
           Dynex
        evaluates all securities in its investment portfolio for other-than-temporary
        impairments. A security is generally defined to be other-than-temporarily
        impaired if, for a maximum period of three consecutive quarters, the carrying
        value of such security exceeds its estimated fair value and Dynex estimates,
        based on projected future cash flows or other fair value determinants, that
        the
        fair value will remain below the carrying value for the foreseeable future.
        If
        an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed to exist, Dynex records an
        impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of the security down to its
        estimated fair value. In certain instances, as a result of the
        other-than-temporary impairment analysis, the recognition or accrual of interest
        will be discontinued and the security will be placed on non-accrual
        status. 

Dynex
        considers an investment to be impaired if the fair value of the investment
        is
        less than its recorded cost basis. Impairments of other investments are
        generally considered to be other-than-temporary when the fair value remains
        below the carrying value for three consecutive quarters. If the impairment
        is
        determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in
        order
        to adjust the carrying value of the investment to its estimated
        value. 

Mortgage
        Servicing Liability.   
        Dynex
        retains the primary servicing rights for certain of its loans, and subcontracts
        the performance of the primary servicing to unrelated third parties. Dynex
        recognizes a liability for the amount by which the estimated value of the
        payments to the third-party servicer exceeds the estimated value of 

F
            -
            12 

Dynex s
        expected servicing cash inflows on the related loans. The value of the mortgage
        servicing liability is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. The
        mortgage servicing liability is amortized in proportion to and over the period
        of the estimated net servicing loss.  

Contingencies.   
        In the
        normal course of business, there are various lawsuits, claims, and contingencies
        pending against the Company. In accordance with SFAS No. 5,    Accounting
        for Contingencies   ,
        we have
        established provisions for estimated losses from pending claims, investigations
        and proceedings. Although the ultimate outcome of the various matters cannot
        be
        ascertained at this point, it is the opinion of management, after consultation
        with counsel, that the resolution of the foregoing matters will not have
        a
        material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company, taken
        as a
        whole, such resolution may, however, have a material effect on the results
        of
        operations or cash flows in any future period, depending on the level of
        income
        for such period. 

Securitization
        Transactions  

Dynex
        securitizes loans and securities in a securitization financing transaction
        by
        transferring financial assets to a wholly owned trust, and the trust issues
        non-recourse bonds pursuant to an indenture. Generally, Dynex retains some
        form
        of control over the transferred assets, and/or the trust is not deemed to
        be a
        qualified special purpose entity. In instances where the trust is deemed
        not to
        be a qualified special purpose entity, the trust is included in the consolidated
        financial statements of Dynex.   A
        transfer of financial assets in which Dynex surrenders control over those
        assets
        is accounted for as a sale to the extent that consideration other than
        beneficial interests in the transferred assets is received in exchange.
  For
        accounting and tax purposes, the loans and securities financed through the
        issuance of bonds in a securitization financing transaction are treated as
        assets of Dynex, and the associated bonds issued are treated as debt of Dynex
        as
        securitization financing. Dynex may retain certain of the bonds issued by
        the
        trust, and Dynex generally will transfer collateral in excess of the bonds
        issued. This excess is typically referred to as over-collateralization. Each
        securitization trust generally provides Dynex the right to redeem, at its
        option, the remaining outstanding bonds prior to their maturity date.

Recent
        Accounting Pronouncements  

In
        December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued SFAS No.
        123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (FAS 123R). This statement supersedes
        APB Opinion No. 25 and its related implementation guidance. The statement
        establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity
        exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services. This statement focuses
        primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee
        services in share-based payment transactions. The most significant change
        resulting from this statement is the requirement for public companies to
        expense
        employee share-based payments under fair value as originally introduced in
        SFAS
        No. 123. This statement is effective for public companies as of the beginning
        of
        the first annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005, or December
        15, 2005 for small business issuers. The Company will adopt this statement
        effective January 1, 2006. Had the Company applied FAS123R to to awards granted
        prior to January 1, 2003 net income to common shareholders and net income
        per
        common share would have been the pro forma amounts reported in the table
        below:.  

In
        May
        2005, the FASB issued SFAS 154,  Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. 
SFAS 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a
        change in accounting principle. Previous 

F
            -
            13 

guidance
        required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized
        by
        including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect
        of
        changing to the new accounting principle. SFAS 154 requires retrospective
        application to prior periods  financial statements of changes in accounting
        principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific
        effects or the cumulative effect of the change. The Company does not believe
        SFAS 154 will have an impact on its financial statements. 

In
        February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 155,  Accounting for Certain Hybrid
        Financial Instruments . Key provisions of SFAS 155 include: (1) a broad
        fair value measurement option for certain hybrid financial instruments that
        contain an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation;
        (2) clarification that only the simplest separations of interest payments
        and principal payments qualify for the exception afforded to interest-only
        strips and principal-only strips from derivative accounting under paragraph
        14
        of FAS 133 (thereby narrowing such exception); (3) a requirement that
        beneficial interests in securitized financial assets be analyzed to determine
        whether they are freestanding derivatives or whether they are hybrid instruments
        that contain embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation; (4) clarification
        that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded
        derivatives; and (5) elimination of the prohibition on a QSPE holding
        passive derivative financial instruments that pertain to beneficial interests
        that are or contain a derivative financial instrument. In general, these
        changes
        will reduce the operational complexity associated with bifurcating embedded
        derivatives, and increase the number of beneficial interests in securitization
        transactions, including interest-only strips and principal-only strips, required
        to be accounted for in accordance with FAS 133. Management does not believe
        that
        SFAS 155 will have a material effect on the financial statements of the
        Company. 

In
        March
        2006 the FASB issued SFAS No.156,  Accounting for Servicing of Financial
        Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140  (SFAS 156). This Statement amends
        FASB Statement No. 140,    Accounting
        for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
        Liabilities,    with
        respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and
        servicing liabilities. This Statement requires an entity to recognize a
        servicing asset or servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation
        to
        service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract in certain
        situations and to initially measure those servicing assets and servicing
        liabilities at fair value, if practicable. SFAS 156 permits an entity to
        measure
        each class of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities
        by either amortizing the servicing asset or liability and assessing the mortgage
        servicing asset or servicing liability for impairment at each reporting date.
        Alternatively, an entity may choose to measure the servicing asset or servicing
        liability at fair value at each reporting date and report changes in fair
        value
        in earnings in the period the changes occur. SFAS 156 permits, at its initial
        adoption, a one-time reclassification of available-for-sale securities to
        trading securities by entities with recognized servicing rights, without
        calling
        into question the treatment of other available-for-sale securities under
        Statement 115, provided that the available-for-sale securities are identified
        in
        some manner as offsetting the entity s exposure to changes in fair value of
        servicing assets or servicing liabilities that a servicer elects to subsequently
        measure at fair value. This statement is effective as of the beginning of
        its
        first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. The Company is currently
        evaluating the potential impact this statement may have on its financial
        statements.

NOTE
        3 - SECURITIZED FINANCE RECEIVABLES  

The
        following table summarizes the components of securitized finance receivables
        as
        of December 31, 2005 and 2004. 

The
        following table summarizes the amortized cost basis, gross unrealized gains
        and
        losses and estimated fair value of debt securities pledged as securitized
        finance receivables as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. 

The
        components of securitized finance receivables at December 31, 2005 and 2004
        are
        as follows: 

All
        of
        the securitized finance receivables are encumbered by securitization financing
        (see Note 8). 

During
        2005, Dynex redeemed, at par, $195,653 of securitization financing bonds
        collateralized by the single-family loans pursuant to its redemption rights
        within the respective indenture. The redemption was partially financed with
        $170,655 of repurchase agreements, of which $133,104 remained outstanding
        at
        December 31, 2005. The redeemed bonds, which collateralize the related
        repurchase agreement financing, have been removed from Dynex s financial
        statements. The repurchase agreement financing has been presented as repurchase
        agreements secured by securitization financing in the accompanying financial
        statements. The redeemed non-recourse securitization financing bonds have
        not
        been retired by Dynex, because of its plans to reissue the bonds. 

During
        2005, Dynex, through its wholly-owned subsidiary MERIT Securities Corporation,
        sold its interests in approximately $367,154 in securitization finance
        receivables and the associated securitization trust, resulting in derecognition
        of these receivables and the extinguishment of $363,871 in related
        securitization financing bonds. Dynex received proceeds of $8,000 for the
        sale
        of these interests, recorded mortgage servicing assets of $3,176
        for

        retained servicing on the loans, and recognized a gain of $8,228. As part
        of
        this transaction, Dynex also sold one of its subsidiaries on which it recorded
        a
        gain of $1,000, which was recorded in other income. 

NOTE
        4 - ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES  

Dynex
        reserves for credit risk where it has exposure to losses on loans in its
        securitized finance receivables portfolio. The allowance for loan losses
        is
        included in securitized finance receivables in the accompanying consolidated
        balance sheets. The following table summarizes the aggregate activity for
        the
        allowance for loan losses for the years ended December 31,   2005,
        2004 and 2003  :  

The
        transfer of $11,309 represents the amount of allowance that was derecognized
        in
        connection with the sale of the related securitized finance receivables
        described above in Note 3.

NOTE
        8 - NON-RECOURSE SECURITIZATION FINANCING  

Dynex,
        through limited-purpose finance subsidiaries, has issued bonds pursuant to
        indentures in the form of non-recourse securitization financing. Each series
        of
        securitization financing may consist of various classes of bonds, either
        at
        fixed or variable rates of interest. Payments received on securitized finance
        receivables and any reinvestment income thereon are used to make payments
        on the
        securitization financing (see Note 3). The obligations under the securitization
        financings are payable solely from the securitized finance receivables and
        are
        otherwise non-recourse to Dynex. The stated maturity date for each class
        of
        bonds is generally calculated based on the final scheduled payment date of
        the
        underlying collateral pledged. The actual maturity of each class will be
        directly affected by the rate of principal prepayments on the related
        collateral. Each series is also subject to redemption at Dynex s option
        according to specific terms of the respective indentures. As a result, the
        actual maturity of any class of a series of securitization financing is likely
        to occur earlier than its stated maturity. If Dynex does not exercise its
        option
        to redeem a class or classes of bonds when it first has the right to do so,
        the
        interest rates on the bonds not redeemed will automatically increase from
        0.30%
        to 2.00%. During 2005, Dynex redeemed non-recourse securitization financing
        as
        discussed in Note 3.

Dynex
        may
        retain certain bond classes of securitization financing issued, including
        investment grade classes, financing these retained bonds with equity. Total
        investment grade bonds at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were none and $20,000,
        respectively, and carried a rating of  BBB  as rated by a nationally recognized
        ratings agency. As these limited-purpose finance subsidiaries are included
        in
        the consolidated financial statements of Dynex, such retained bonds are
        eliminated in the consolidated financial statements, while the associated
        repurchase agreements outstanding, if any, are included as recourse
        debt. 

The
        components of non-recourse securitization financing along with certain other
        information at December 31, 2005 and 2004 are summarized as
        follows: 

The
        variable rate classes were sold during 2005. At December 31, 2005, the
        weighted-average effective rate of the fixed rate classes was 6.8%. The average
        effective rate of interest for non-recourse securitization financing was
        7.4%,
        6.4%, and 5.9%, for the years ended December 31, 2005,   2004  ,
        and
        2003, respectively. 

NOTE
        9 - REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS   

The
        Company entered into a repurchase agreement, which is recourse to the Company,
        to partially finance the redemption of certain securitization financing bonds
        during 2005 as described in Note 3. The repurchase agreement has a remaining
        balance of $133,104 and is collateralized by the related redeemed bonds,
        which
        were eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The repurchase
        agreement matures monthly and has a rate of a weighted average rate of 0.10%
        over one-month LIBOR (4.48% at December 31, 2005). The bonds pledged as
        collateral for the repurchase agreement have an estimated fair value of $153,499
        and pay interest at a blended rate of one-month LIBOR plus 0.32%. 

Dynex
        also utilizes other recourse repurchase agreements to finance certain of
        its
        investments. There were $211 and $70,468 outstanding at December 31, 2005
        and
        2004, respectively, which were collateralized by securities with a market
        value
        of $20,133 and $78,491, respectively. These repurchase agreements bear interest
        based on one-month LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 0.10% to 0.60%, which
        represented a weighted average rate of 4.57% at December 31, 2005.

        107,  Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments  requires the
        disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments. The following
        table presents the recorded basis and estimated fair values of Dynex s financial
        instruments as of December 31,   2005  
        and
  2004  : 

Estimates
        of fair value for securitized finance receivables are determined by calculating
        the present value of the projected cash flows of the instruments, using discount
        rates, prepayment rate assumptions and credit loss assumptions based on
        historical experience and estimated future activity, and using discount rates
        commensurate with those Dynex believes would be used by third parties.
        Prepayment rate assumptions for each year are based in part on the actual
        prepayment rates experienced for the prior six-month period and in part on
        management s estimate of future prepayment activity. The loss assumptions
        utilized vary for each series of securitized finance receivables, depending
        on
        the collateral pledged. Estimates of fair value for other investments are
        determined by calculating the present value of the projected net cash flows,
        inclusive of the estimated cost to service these investments. Estimates of
        fair
        value for securities are based principally on market prices provided by certain
        dealers. Fair value for securitization financing is determined based on
        estimated current market rates for similar instruments.  

NOTE
        11 - DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

In
        June
        2002, the Company entered into an interest rate swap to mitigate its interest
        rate risk exposure on $100,000 in notional value of its variable rate
        non-recourse securitization financing, which finance a like amount of fixed
        rate
        assets. Under the agreement, the Company paid interest at a fixed rate of
        3.73%
        on the notional amount and received interest based on one month LIBOR on
        the
        same amount. This contract had been treated as a cash flow hedge with gains
        and
        losses associated with the change in the value of the hedge being reported
        as a
        component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts in accumulated
        other comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings in the same period
        during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. During 2005, the swap
        matured, and the Company recognized the remaining $493 in other comprehensive
        loss on this hedge instrument. At December 31, 2005 and   2004  ,
        the
        aggregate accumulated other comprehensive loss on this hedge instrument was
        none
        and $493, respectively.  

In
        October 2002, the Company entered into a synthetic three-year amortizing
        interest-rate swap (using Eurodollar Futures contracts) with an initial notional
        balance of approximately $81,000 to mitigate its exposure to rising interest
        rates on a portion of its variable rate non-recourse securitization financing,
        which finance a like amount of fixed rate assets. This contract was accounted
        for as a cash flow hedge with gains and losses associated with the change
        in the
        value of the hedge being reported as a component of accumulated other
        comprehensive income. Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are
        reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged
        transaction affects earnings. During 2004, the Company determined that this
        hedge 

F
            -
            19 

instrument
        ceased to be effective due to a significant deterioration in the correlation
        between the synthetic interest rate swap cash flow hedge and the financing
        being
        hedged, as measured by the correlation between the three-month Eurodollar
        futures and one-month LIBOR. Accordingly, the Company discontinued hedge
        accounting in 2004 and reflected subsequent changes in the market value of
        the
        hedge instrument in its statement of operations as other income (expense).
        The
        unrealized loss included in other comprehensive income at the time the Company
        discontinued hedge accounting in 2004 was amortized over the remaining term
        of
        the hedge exposure. During 2005, the Company matched out of the position
        and
        recognized $116 in other comprehensive loss. At December 31, 2005 and 2004,
        the
        aggregate accumulated other comprehensive loss on this hedge instrument was
        none
        and $116, respectively.

        the
        Series A, Series B, and Series C preferred stock into a new Series D preferred
        stock and common stock. As part of the recapitalization plan, the Company
        also
        exchanged 9.50% Senior Notes due 2007 for Series A, Series B and Series C
        preferred stock. The remaining shares of Series A, Series B and Series C
        preferred stock were converted into 5,628,737 shares of Series D preferred
        stock
        and 1,288,488 shares of common stock. The Series D preferred stock had an
        issue
        price of $10 per share and pays $0.95 per year in dividends. All prior
        dividends-in-arrears on the Series A, Series B and Series C preferred stock
        were
        extinguished.

Dynex
        is
        authorized to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. For all series
        issued, dividends are cumulative from the date of issue and are payable
        quarterly in arrears. The dividends are equal, per share, to the greater
        of
        (i) the per quarter base rate of $0.2375 for Series D, or (ii)  the
        quarterly dividend declared on Dynex s common stock. One share of Series D
        preferred stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into
        one
        share of common stock. The series is redeemable by Dynex at any time, in
        whole
        or in part, (i) at a rate of one share of preferred stock for one share of
        common stock, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, provided that for 20 trading
        days within any period of 30 consecutive trading days, the closing price
        of the
        common stock equals or exceeds the issue price, or (ii) for cash at the
        issue price, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. 

In
        the
        event of liquidation, the holders of this series of preferred stock will
        be
        entitled to receive out of the assets of Dynex, prior to any such distribution
        to the common shareholders, the issue price per share in cash, plus any accrued
        and unpaid dividends. For purposes of determining net income (loss) to common
        shareholders used in the calculation of earnings (loss) per share, preferred
        stock charge includes the current period dividend accrual amount for the
        Preferred Stock outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
        2003
        of $5,347, $3,936, and $5,167, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, 2004,
        and
        2003, the total amount of dividends-in-arrears was none, none, and $18,466,
        respectively. If Dynex fails to pay dividends for two quarterly dividend
        periods
        or if Dynex fails to maintain consolidated shareholders  equity of at least 200%
        of the aggregate issue price of the Series D preferred stock, then these
        shares
        automatically convert into a new series of 9.50% senior notes.  

The
        following table presents the changes in the number of preferred and common
        shares outstanding: 

On
        January 9, 2006, the Company paid approximately $14,105 to redeem 1,407,198
        shares of its Series D Preferred Stock. After the redemption, there were
        4,221,539 shares of Series D Preferred Stock outstanding. The Company also
        announced a common stock repurchase program under which it may repurchase
        up to
        one million shares of its common stock.

Impairment
        charges for 2005, 2004, and 2003 are summarized below. Impairment charges
        include other-than-temporary impairment of debt securities arising from credit
        losses on securities backed by manufactured housing loans, declining valuations
        on delinquent property tax receivable securities, and valuation adjustments
        for
        related real estate owned. These impairments arose from revised projections
        of
        collections on the delinquent property tax receivable portfolio, as discussed
        in
        Note 5, and lower expected recoveries on real estate owned.

Pursuant
        to Dynex s 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, as approved by the shareholders at Dynex s
        2005 annual shareholders  meeting (the  Stock Incentive Plan ), Dynex may grant
        to eligible officers, directors and employees stock options, stock appreciation
        rights ( SARs ) and restricted stock awards. An aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of
        common stock is available for distribution pursuant to the Employee Incentive
        Plan. Dynex may also grant dividend equivalent rights ( DERs ) in connection
        with the grant of options or SARs. 

On
        January 2, 2005, Dynex granted 126,297 stock appreciation rights (SAR) to
        certain of its employees and officers under the Stock Incentive Plan. The
        SARs
        vest over the next four years in equal annual installments, expire on December
        31, 2011 and have an exercise price of $7.81 per share, which was the market
        price of the stock on the grant date. 

On
        June
        17, 2005, Dynex granted options to acquire an aggregate of 40,000 shares
        of
        common stock to the members of its Board of Directors under the Stock Incentive
        Plan. The options have an exercise price of $8.46 per share, which represents
        110% of the closing stock price on the grant date, expire on June 17, 2010
        and
        were fully vested when granted. 

Dynex

Employee
        Savings Plan  

Dynex
        provides an Employee Savings Plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue
        Code. The Employee Savings Plan allows eligible employees to defer up to
        25% of
        their income on a pretax basis. Dynex matches the employees  contribution, up to
        6% of the employees  eligible compensation. Dynex may also make discretionary
        contributions based on the profitability of Dynex. The total expense related
        to
        Dynex s matching and discretionary contributions in 2005, 2004, and 2003 was
        $94, $122 and $136, respectively. Dynex does not provide post employment
        or post
        retirement benefits to its employees. 

401(k)
        Overflow Plan  

During
        1997, Dynex adopted a non-qualifying overflow plan which covers employees
        who
        have contributed to the Employee Savings Plan the maximum amount allowed
        under
        the Internal Revenue Code. The excess contributions are made to the overflow
        plan on an after-tax basis. However, Dynex partially reimburses employees
        for
        the effect of the contributions being made on an after-tax basis. Dynex matches
        the employee s contribution up to 6% of the employee s eligible compensation.
        There was no reimbursement expense in 2005, 2004 or 2003.  

NOTE
        16 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

Dynex
        makes various representations and warranties relating to the sale or
        securitization of loans. To the extent Dynex were to breach any of these
        representations or warranties, and such breach could not be cured within
        the
        allowable time period, Dynex would be required to repurchase such loans,
        and
        could incur losses. In the opinion of management, no material losses are
        expected to result from any such representations and warranties and, therefore,
        have not been accrued for as a liability. 

As
        of
        December 31, 2005, Dynex is obligated under non-cancelable operating leases
        with
        expiration dates through 2008. Rent and lease expense under those leases
        was
        $186, $473, and $489, respectively in 2005,   2004  ,
        and

NOTE
        17 - LITIGATION   

The
        Company and its subsidiaries may be involved in certain litigation matters
        arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the ultimate outcome
        of
        these matters cannot be ascertained at this time, and the results of legal
        proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes, based
        on
        current knowledge, that the resolution of these matters will not have a material
        adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. Information
        on litigation arising out of the ordinary course of business is described
        below. 

Dynex
        Capital, Inc. , and one of our subsidiaries, GLS Capital, Inc. ( GLS ), together
        with the County of Allegheny, Pennsylvania ( Allegheny County ), are defendants
        in a lawsuit in the Court of Common Pleas, in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.
        Plaintiffs are two local businesses seeking status to represent as a class,
        delinquent taxpayers in Allegheny County whose delinquent tax liens had been
        purchased by, and subsequently assigned to, GLS. This lawsuit relates to
        the
        purchase by GLS of delinquent property tax receivables from Allegheny County
        in
        1997, 1998, and 1999, and subsequent collection of certain amounts related
        to
        the property tax receivables purchased. The suit was initially filed in 1997,
        and challenges GLS  right to charge   certain
        attorney fees, costs and

            23 

expenses,
        and interest in the collection of delinquent property tax receivables owned
        by
        GLS. During 2005, the Court held hearings in this matter, and has not yet
        ruled
        on whether it will grant class action status in the litigation.  Plaintiffs
        have not enumerated its damages in this matter.  GLS believes the claims
        are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself in this matter.
        The
        Company believes that the ultimate outcome of this litigation will not have
        a
        material impact on its financial condition, but may have a material impact
        on
        reported results for the particular period presented.  

Dynex
        Capital, Inc. and Dynex Commercial, Inc. ( DCI ), formerly an affiliate and now
        known as DCI Commercial, Inc., are appellees (or  respondents ) in the Court of
        Appeals for the Fifth Judicial District of Texas at Dallas, related to the
        matter of Basic Capital Management et al  (collectively,  BCM  or  the
        Plaintiffs ) versus Dynex Commercial, Inc. et al.  The appeal seeks to
        overturn a judgment in favor of the Company and DCI which denied recovery
        to
        Plaintiffs, as discussed further below, and to have a judgment entered in
        favor
        of Plaintiffs based on a jury award for damages against the Company of $0.3
        million, and against DCI for $2.2 million or $25.6 million, all of which
        was set
        aside by the trial court.  In the alternative, Plaintiffs are seeking a new
        trial. The appeal relates to a suit filed against us and DCI in 1999, alleging,
          among
        other things, that DCI and we failed to fund tenant improvement or other
        advances allegedly required on various loans made by DCI to BCM, which loans
        were subsequently acquired by Dynex; that DCI breached an alleged $160 million
         master  loan commitment entered into in February 1998; and that DCI breached
        another alleged loan commitment of approximately $9 million. The original
        trial
        commenced in January 2004, and, in February 2004, the jury in the case rendered
        a verdict in favor of one of the Plaintiffs and against the Company on the
        alleged breach of the loan agreements for tenant improvements and awarded
        that
        Plaintiff damages in the amount of $0.25 million. The jury entered a separate
        verdict against DCI in favor of BCM under two mutually exclusive damage models,
        for $2.2 million and $25.6 million, respectively. The jury found in favor
        of DCI
        on the alleged $9 million loan commitment, but did not find in favor of DCI
        for
        counterclaims made against BCM. The jury also awarded the Plaintiffs attorneys 
fees in the amount of $2.1 million. After considering post-trial motions,
        the
        presiding judge entered judgment in favor of the Company and DCI, effectively
        overturning the verdicts of the jury and dismissing damages awarded by the
        jury.
        DCI is a former affiliate of the Company, and the Company believes that it
        will
        have no obligation for amounts, if any, awarded to the Plaintiffs as a result
        of
        the actions of DCI.   The
        Court
        of Appeals has scheduled an oral argument on the matter for April 18, 2006.

On
        February 11, 2005, a putative class action complaint alleging violations
        of the
        federal securities laws and various state common law claims was filed against
        Dynex Capital, Inc., our subsidiary MERIT Securities Corporation, Stephen
        J.
        Benedetti, the Company's Executive Vice President, and Thomas H. Potts, the
        Company's former President and a former Director, in United States District
        Court for the Southern District of New York ( District Court ) by the Teamsters
        Local 445 Freight Division Pension Fund ("Teamsters").  The lawsuit
        purported to be a class action on behalf of purchasers of MERIT Series 13
        securitization financing bonds, which are collateralized by manufactured
        housing
        loans.  On May 31, 2005, the Teamsters filed an amended class action
        complaint.  The amended complaint dropped all state common law claims but
        added federal securities claims related to the MERIT Series 12 securitization
        financing bonds.  In February 2006, based on a motion to dismiss filed by
        the Company, the District Court dismissed Messrs. Benedetti and Potts from
        the
        suit, but did not dismiss the claims against us or MERIT.  The Company has
        evaluated the allegations and believes them to be without merit and intends
        to
        vigorously defend itself against them. 

Although
        no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of the above
        litigation, the Company believes the resolution of these lawsuits will not
        have
        a material effect on its consolidated balance sheet but could materially
        affect
        its consolidated results of operations in a given year.

NOTE
        19 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

Dynex
        and
        Dynex Commercial, Inc., now known as DCI Commercial, Inc ( DCI ) have been
        jointly named in litigation regarding the activities of DCI while it was
        an
        operating subsidiary of an affiliate of Dynex. Dynex and DCI entered into
        a
        Litigation Cost Sharing Agreement whereby the parties set forth how the costs
        of
        defending against litigation would be shared, and whereby Dynex agreed to
        fund
        all costs of such litigation, including DCI s portion. DCI s cumulative portion
        of costs associated with litigation and funded by Dynex is $3,276 and is
        secured
        by the proceeds of any counterclaims that DCI may receive in the litigation.
        DCI
        costs funded by Dynex are considered loans, and bear simple interest at the
        rate
        of Prime plus 8.0% per annum. At December 31, 2005, the total amount due
        Dynex
        under the Litigation Cost Sharing Agreement, including interest, was $4,624,
        which has been fully reserved by Dynex. DCI is currently wholly owned by
        ICD
        Holding, Inc. An executive of Dynex is the sole shareholder of ICD Holding.

NOTE
        20 - NON-CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES  

The
        following tables summarize the financial condition and result of operations
        of
        all entities for which Dynex accounts for by use of the equity
        method. 

Dynex
        has
        a 99% limited partnership interest in a partnership that owns a commercial
        office building located in St. Paul, Minnesota. The building is leased pursuant
        to a triple-net master lease to a single-tenant and the second mortgage lender
        has a bargain purchase option to purchase the building in 2007. Rental income
        derived from the master lease for the term of the lease exactly covers the
        operating cash requirements on the building, including the payment of debt
        service. Dynex accounts for the partnership using the cost method. The
        partnership had net income of $809, $706 and $589 for the years ended December
        31, 2005,   2004  
        and
  2003  ,
        respectively. Due to the bargain purchase option, any increase in basis of
        the
        investment due to the accrual of its share of earnings of the partnership
        is
        immediately reduced by a charge of a like amount to the same account, given
        the
        probability of exercise of the option by the second mortgage lender. Dynex s
        investment in this partnership amounted to $11 at December 31, 2005,
  2004  
        and
  2003  . 

Dynex
        owns a 1% limited partnership interest in a partnership that owns a low income
        housing tax credit multifamily housing property located in Texas. In May
        2001,
        Dynex sold a 98% limited partnership interest in a partnership to a former
        director for a purchase price of $198, which was equal to its estimated fair
        value. By reason of the former director s investment in the partnership, Dynex
        has guaranteed to the director the use of the low-income housing tax credits
        associated with the property, proportionate to his investment, that are reported
        annually to the Internal Revenue Service. During 2005, Dynex loaned the
        partnership $107. These advances bear interest at 

F
            -
            24 

a
        rate of
        7.50% and are due on demand. Dynex, through a subsidiary has made a first
        mortgage loan to the partnership secured by the property, with a current
        unpaid
        principal balance of $1,717. As Dynex does not have control or exercise
        significant influence over the operations of this partnership, its investment
        and total advances of $355 at December 31, 2005 are accounted for using the
        cost
        method. 

NOTE
        21 - SUMMARY OF FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS (UNAUDITED)  

The
        following table summarizes selected information for the quarter ended December
        31, 2005: 

During
        the three-months ended December 31, 2005, Dynex recognized a loss of $213
        associated with the sale of equity securities owned by Dynex. Dynex recognized
        impairment charges of $215 on its investment in the limited partnership interest
        discussed in Note 20.

(a)    
             
                designed
                such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure
                controls and procedures to be designed under my supervision, to ensure
                that material information relating to the registrant, including its
                consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those
                entities, particularly during the period in which this report is
                being
                prepared; 

(b)    
             
                evaluated
                the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and
                procedures     and
                presented in this report my conclusions about the effectiveness of
                the
                disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered
                by
                this report based on such evaluation; and 

(c)    
             
                disclosed
                in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over
                financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent
                fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an
                annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
                to
                materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial
                reporting; and 

5.    
             
                I
                have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal control
                over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit
                committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing
                the equivalent functions): 

(a)    
             
                all
                significant deficiencies     and
                material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control
                over
                financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
                the
                registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
                information; and  

(b)    
             
                any
                fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
