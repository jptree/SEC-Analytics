LIGHTPATH TECHNOLOGIES, INC.              Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (Unaudited)              December 31, 2005              Basis of
Presentation             The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Article 10 of Regulation S-X and, therefore, do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations, and cash
flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and related
notes, included in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.            These condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited but include all adjustments, which include normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of
management, are necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the interim periods presented. Results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that
may be expected for the year as a whole.             History and Liquidity
             History : LightPath Technologies, Inc. ( LightPath  or
the  Company ) was incorporated in Delaware in 1992. In order to pursue a strategy of supplying hardware to the telecommunications industry, in April 2000, the Company acquired Horizon Photonics, Inc. (Horizon), and in September 2000 the
Company acquired Geltech, Inc (Geltech). During fiscal 2003, in response to sales declines in the telecommunications industry, the operations of Horizon in California and LightPath in New Mexico were consolidated into the former Geltech facility in
Orlando, Florida.            In November 2005 ,  the Company announced the formation
of LightPath Optical Instrumentation (Shanghai) Co., Ltd, ( LPOI ) a wholly owned manufacturing subsidiary, located in Jiading, People s Republic of China ( PRC ). The manufacturing operations will be housed in a 17,000 sq.
ft. facility located in the Jiading Industrial Zone near Shanghai.            This plant
is expected to increase overall production capacity and enable LightPath to compete for larger production volumes of optical components and assemblies, and strengthen partnerships within the Asia/Pacific region. It also provides a launching point to
drive the Company s sales expansion in Asia/Pacific.            The Company is
engaged in the production of precision molded aspherical lenses, GRADIUM          glass lenses, collimators and isolator optics used in various markets, including industrial, medical, defense, test   measurement and telecommunications. As used herein, the terms  LightPath, 
 Company,   we,   us,  or  our,  refer to LightPath individually or, as the context requires, collectively with its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.             Liquidity : During fiscal years 2004 and 2005, progress was made to reduce cash
outflow. In fiscal 2004, cash used in operations was approximately $2.5 million. In fiscal 2005, cash used in operations was $1.1 million. The Company s operating plan in fiscal 2006 includes reaching positive cash flow from operations during
the third quarter. During the quarter ending December 31, 2005, the company achieved a modest positive cash flow from operations of $285,000. Although, there can be no assurance that the full year plan can be achieved and the Company has no
firm commitments for any material future financing, if needed, at this time. At December 31, 2005, the Company has a cash and cash equivalent balance of approximately $1.6 million.            On January 11, 2006, the Company and Regenmacher Holdings, Ltd. ( Regenmacher ) executed a four-year secured loan agreement.
The secured loan facility, which carries an interest rate of 1% above the prime rate, provides for borrowings of up to a maximum Borrowing Base of $500,000 to be secured by the acquired assets and other mutually agreed assets.            LightPath may draw up to $500,000 during the first twelve months following the execution of
the agreement. Upon the commencement of the thirteenth month, the Loan will convert into a term loan and be amortized over a thirty-six (36) month period. Payments will be made in thirty-six (36) equal monthly installments.            The Company may seek external debt or equity financing in 2006 or thereafter, if it can be
obtained in an amount and on terms that are acceptable to us, though no assurance can be made that financing will be available.

    LIGHTPATH TECHNOLOGIES, INC.              Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (Unaudited)              December 31, 2005             As heretofore stated, significant risk and uncertainty remains in achieving the goal of
generating cash flow from operations on an ongoing basis. The Company did generate positive cash flow from operations in the quarter but not for the six months ended December 31, 2005. Factors which could adversely affect cash balances in
future quarters include, but are not limited to, a decline in revenue or a lack of anticipated sales growth, increased material costs, increased labor costs, planned production efficiency (yield) improvements not being realized, and increases in
other discretionary spending required to effectively compete in our markets.            As a result of the Company s cash flow position, should the Company find it desirable or necessary to issue additional equity securities or debt that may be convertible into or exercisable for equity securities, the action would have
the effect of increasing our fully diluted shares outstanding and ultimately diluting our operating results (net earnings or net loss) per share, and the action would dilute the voting power of current stockholders who do not acquire sufficient
additional shares to maintain their percentage of share ownership.             1.
Significant Accounting Policies              Condensed consolidated financial
statements  include the accounts of the Company, and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.             Cash and cash equivalents  consist of cash in the bank and temporary investments with maturities of 90 days or less when purchased.
            Inventories,  which consist principally of raw materials,
work-in-process and finished lenses, isolators, collimators and assemblies are stated at the lower of cost or market, on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs include materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. In accordance with FASB
Statement No.151,  Inventory Costs , the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) are recognized as a current-period charge and the allocation of fixed production
overheads to the costs of conversion is based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. This Statement is effective for the Company for inventory costs incurred on or after July 1, 2005. The adoption of this Statement had no effect
on the Company s financial statements.             Property and equipment  are
stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets ranging from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful
lives of the related assets using the straight-line method.             Long-lived
assets  are recorded in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 144,  Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.  SFAS No. 144 provides a single accounting model for
long-lived assets to be disposed of, changed the criteria for classifying an asset as held for sale, and broadened the scope of businesses to be disposed of that qualify for reporting as discontinued operations and changed the timing of recognizing
losses on such operations.            In accordance with SFAS No. 144, long-lived
assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated
future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower
of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the
balance sheet.             Intangible assets,  consisting of customer list and
supply contracts, licenses, patents, trademarks, and others, are recorded at cost. Upon issuance of the license, patent or trademark, these assets are being amortized on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related assets
ranging from ten to seventeen years. Customer list and supply contracts and other intangibles are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of benefit ranging from two to five years.

    LIGHTPATH TECHNOLOGIES, INC.              Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (Unaudited)              December 31, 2005             The Company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with SFAS No. 142,
 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.  SFAS 142 eliminates the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives. Amortization will continue to be recorded for intangible assets with definite useful lives.
SFAS 142 also requires at least an annual impairment review of goodwill and other intangible assets. The Company evaluates its intangible assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS 144.             Income taxes  are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred income
tax assets and liabilities are computed on the basis of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based upon enacted tax laws and rates
applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.             Revenue  is generally recognized from product sales when products are shipped to the
customer, provided that LightPath has received a valid purchase order, the price is fixed, title has transferred, collection of the associated receivable is reasonably assured, and there are no remaining significant obligations. Revenues from
product development agreements are recognized as milestones are completed in accordance with the terms of the agreements. Provisions for estimated losses are made in the period in which such losses are determined.             New product development  costs are expensed as
incurred.             Stock-based compensation  is recognized following the
guidelines of SFAS 123 (revised 2004),  Share-Based Payment  ( SFAS 123R ). Prior to July 1, 2005, the Company applied the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  ( SFAS
123 ). In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123, the Company applied APB 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees  ( APB 25 ) and related interpretations in accounting for its plans and, accordingly, did not recognize
compensation expense for these plans because the Company issued options at exercise prices equal to the market value at date of grant.            Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company applied the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS 123 through June 30 2005, the cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle has not been reflected in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2004. The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was approximately $459,000
and $475,000, respectively; net of tax for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2004, which has been appropriately reflected in the Company s pro forma SFAS 123 disclosures presented below.            Effective July 1, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS 123R, which revises SFAS 123 and
supersedes APB 25. SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values using an option-pricing model, such as the Black-Scholes model, at the date of grant. SFAS 123R
allows the use of either the modified prospective method or the retrospective recognition method. The Company elected to use the modified prospective method for adoption, which requires compensation expense to be recorded for all unvested stock
options and restricted shares beginning in the first quarter of adoption. For all unvested options outstanding as of July 1, 2005, and subsequently granted options, the previously measured but unrecognized compensation expense, based on the
fair value at the original grant date, will be recognized on a straight-line basis in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the remaining vesting period. SFAS 123R requires that the Company estimate forfeitures when recognizing compensation
expense and that this estimate of forfeitures be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized
through a cumulative catch-up adjustment, which is recognized in the period of change, and also impact the amount of unamortized compensation expense to be recognized in future periods.            The following table shows the Company s net income for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2004 had compensation expense
for the Company s stock option plans applicable to the Company s employees been determined based upon the fair value at the grant date for awards consistent with the methodology prescribed by SFAS 123. This table assumes a zero tax rate.
These pro forma effects may not be representative of expense in future periods since the estimated fair value of stock options on the date of grant is amortized to expense over the vesting period and additional options may be granted or options may
be cancelled in future years. These pro forma effects may also not be representative of expense recognized under SFAS 123R, which the Company adopted beginning July 1, 2005:

           Management makes estimates  and
assumptions during the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information
becomes available, which in turn could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein.             Fair values of financial instruments  of the Company are disclosed as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107,  Disclosures about Fair Values of Financial Instruments.  The
carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value.             Reclassification  of certain items in the prior year s consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements have been reclassified
to conform with the fiscal 2006 presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on stockholders  equity or net earnings.             Recently issued accounting standards.  In September 2005, the EITF issued EITF Issue No. 04-13  Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same
Counterparty . EITF 04-13 provides guidance as to when purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty should be accounted for as a single exchange transaction. EITF 04-13 also provides guidance as to when a nonmonetary exchange of
inventory should be accounted for at fair value. EITF 04-13 will be applied to new arrangements entered into, and modifications or renewals of existing arrangements occurring after January 1, 2007. The application of EITF 04-13 is not expected
to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.

           5. Stock and share based payments
            As discussed in Note 1 above, the Company adopted the expense recognition
provisions of SFAS 123R as of July 1, 2005. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R compensation expense has been recognized on a straight-line basis for all unvested share-based payments in the Company s Consolidated Statements of
Operations for all periods beginning after July 1, 2005. Stock option compensation expense is recognized based the projected value of the option used a Black Sholes option model; this model sets the compensation value of the option based on
exercise price of the option, life of the option, historic change in the company stock price and current yield on the 10 year treasury bill. For the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2005, the Company recognized approximately $22,000
and $35,000, respectively, of share-based compensation expense related to stock options and approximately $46,000 and $90,000, respectively, of share-based compensation expense related to restricted shares and restricted share units.            SFAS 123R requires that the Company estimate forfeitures when recognizing compensation
expense and that this estimate of forfeitures be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized
through a cumulative catch-up adjustment, which is recognized in the period of change, and also impact unamortized compensation expense to be recognized in future periods.            For the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2005, there were 53,600 and 82,170, respectively, stock options granted to employees
and no stock options were exercised. There were no options cancelled during the quarter ending December 31, 2005, and 11,604 stock options were cancelled during the six months ended December 31, 2005. There were 60,000 restricted share
units granted to employees and no restricted stock or restricted stock units were cancelled during the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, 173,300 stock options and 191,850 restricted shares and
restricted share units remained outstanding.            The unamortized compensation
expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to restricted shares, restricted share units and stock options issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2005, will be recognized in future periods as follows:

    LIGHTPATH TECHNOLOGIES, INC.              Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   (Unaudited)              December 31, 2005              6. Net Loss Per Share             Basic net loss per share is computed based upon the weighted average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding, not
including unvested restricted stock, during each period presented. The computation of diluted net loss per share does not differ from the basic computation because potentially issuable securities would be anti-dilutive. As such, the numerator and
the denominator used in computing both basic and diluted net loss per share are equal.             7. Foreign Operations             Assets and liabilities denominated in
non-U.S. currencies are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange for the six-month period. Gains or losses on the translation of the financial
statements of a non-U.S. operation, where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are reflected as a separate component of equity. The Company as of December 31,2005 had approximately $88,000 in assets and $86,000 in net assets
located in China.             8. Contingencies             In fiscal 2002, the Company reached a settlement agreement with participating Class E
shareholders regarding the redemption of their outstanding shares. The agreement required the Company to pay $0.40 per share to each Class E shareholder and permitted Class E shareholders to elect not to participate in the settlement. Since the
beginning of fiscal 2003, the Company has distributed approximately $1.4 million of the $1.5 million estimated total cost arising under the settlement. Approximately 12% of the former Class E shareholders elected not to participate and commenced a
separate action in a Texas state court seeking additional compensation (the  Texas Action ).            In the Texas Action, the Company s motion for Summary Judgment was granted in 2003, and the plantiffs  attempts to have that decision reconsidered or overturned have been rejected by the Texas courts in
several rulings including the most recent decision handed down on December 22, 2005, by the 14th District Court of Appeals. The court s ruling affirmed the Company s position and denied the plaintiffs  motion for a rehearing. The
plaintiffs  can elect to appeal the ruling, and at the time of this report the Company has not been notified as to the plantiffs  decision.            The Company from time to time is involved in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. The Company has been notified of two employment practices
claims from former employees. In one of those employment actions, on November 7, 2005, pursuant to the Company s motion, the magistrate of the 9   th    Circuit Court, Orange County Florida recommended dismissal of the actions. The plaintiff in that action has filed an appeal, a hearing which is scheduled for April 2006. The company has denied any
violation related to the second claim and has declined to participate in any settlement discussions. To date, the company has received no further notice of actions taken. Based on the current information, management is not able to estimate the
probability of a loss related to these actions.             9. Subsequent Events
            On January 11, 2006, the Company and Regenmacher Holdings, Ltd.
( Regenmacher ) executed a four-year secured loan agreement. The secured loan facility, which carries an interest rate of 1% above the prime rate, provides for borrowings of up to a maximum Borrowing Base of $500,000 to be secured by the
acquired and other mutually agreed assets. At February 7, 2006, the borrowings under the agreement totaled $206,250.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations              The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. All statements in this
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and elsewhere in this Report, other than statements of historical facts, which address activities, events or developments that we expect or
anticipate will or may occur in the future, including such things as future capital expenditures, growth, product development, sales, business strategy and other similar matters are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are
based largely on our current expectations and assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements set forth herein as a
result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the need for additional financing, intense competition in various aspects of its business and other risks described in our reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In
light of these risks and uncertainties, all of the forward-looking statements made herein are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by us will be realized. We
undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements contained herein.              Overview              Historical : We are in
the business of supplying users with glass lenses and other specialty optical products, which have applications in a number of different industries. Due to the emergence of optical technologies in communications, networking and data storage products
in the late 1990 s, there was a significant surge in demand for our products, particularly in the period represented by our fiscal 1999-2001 years. During this period, our revenues increased from less than $2 million in sales to approximately
$25 million due to both acquisitions (to add glass lens production capacity and market presence, and isolators to our existing line of collimators and proprietary glass lenses) and organic product line growth.            During fiscal 2002, optical component markets experienced a severe downturn that resulted in
a significant decline in the demand for our products. By fiscal 2003, our sales had contracted to just under $7 million. The business infrastructure was too large and diverse to support a business of this reduced size and a decision was made in late
fiscal 2002 and implemented during fiscal 2003 to close our isolator production facility in California and our headquarters and collimator and lens production facility in New Mexico. The productive capacity in these locations was moved to excess
space in the acquired lens business facility in Florida and production of all of the aforementioned products continues there. These moves were completed by June 30, 2003, resulting in a significant reduction in the net cash use by the business.
           In November 2005 ,  the Company announced the formation of LightPath
Optical Instrumentation (Shanghai) Co., Ltd, ( LPOI ) a wholly owned manufacturing subsidiary, located in Jiading, People s Republic of China ( PRC ). The manufacturing operations will be housed in a 17,000 sq. ft. facility
located in the Jiading Industrial Zone near Shanghai. This plant is expected to increase overall production capacity and enable the Company to compete for larger production volumes of optical components and assemblies, and strengthen partnerships
within the Asia/Pacific region.            The Company executes all foreign sales and
intercompany transactions in U.S. dollars, mitigating the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet date, and revenues and
expenses are translated at average rates of exchange for the three and six month periods. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2005 the Company incurred a deminimus loss on foreign currency.            Nevertheless, the ongoing total cash flow by the business remains negative each quarter and
management, while continuing to work toward reducing costs and producing product at lower per-unit costs, believes that increased sales volumes will be required to permit our Company to be self-sustaining in terms of a regular and positive cash flow
from operations. Additions to the sales and customer service organizations have aided sales increases during the last two fiscal years.            How we operate: We have continuing sales of two basic types: occasional sales via ad-hoc purchase orders of mostly standard product configurations (our  turns 
business) and the more challenging and potentially more rewarding business with characteristics of the semi-conductor industry. In this latter type of business we work with a customer to help them determine optical specifications and even create
certain optical designs for them, including complex multi-component         
   13   

Table of Contents  

   designs that we call  engineered assemblies.  That is followed by  sampling  them small numbers of
the product for their test and evaluation. Thereafter, should the customer conclude that our specification or design is the best solution to their product need; we negotiate and  win  a contract (sometimes called a  design win )
  whether of a  blanket purchase order  type or a supply agreement. The strategy is to create an annuity revenue stream that makes the best use of our production capacity as compared to the turns business, which is unpredictable and
uneven. A key business objective is to convert as much of our business to the design win and annuity model as is possible. We have several challenges in doing so:         

Maintaining an optical design and new product sampling capability, including a high-quality and responsive optical design engineering staff.           

The fact that as our customers take products of this nature into higher volume, commercial production they begin to work seriously to reduce costs   which often leads them to
turn to larger or overseas producers, even if sacrificing quality.           

Our small business mass means that we can only offer a moderate amount of total productive capacity before we reach financial constraints imposed by the need to make additional
capital expenditures   in other words, because of our limited cash resources and cash flow, we cannot service the biggest such opportunities that may present themselves in the market.              Despite these challenges to winning more  annuity  business, we nevertheless have
been and believe we can continue to be successful in procuring this business because of our unique capabilities in optical design engineering that we make available on the merchant market, a market that we believe is underserved in this area of
service offering. Additionally, we believe that we offer value to some customers as a second or backup source of supply in the United States should they be unwilling to commit all of their source of supply of a critical component to a foreign
merchant production source. We also continue to have the proprietary GRADIUM lens glass technology to offer to certain laser markets.             Our key indicators :             Sales Backlog    We believe that sales growth will be our best indicator of success. Our best view into the efficacy of our sales efforts is in our  order
book.  Our order book equates to sales  backlog.  It has a quantitative and a qualitative aspect: quantitatively, our backlog s prospective dollar value and qualitatively, what percent of the backlog is scheduled by the customer
for date-certain delivery. We define our  disclosure backlog  as that which is requested by the customer for delivery within one year and which is reasonably likely to remain in the backlog and be converted into revenues. This includes
customer purchase orders and may include amounts under supply contracts if they meet the aforementioned criteria. At December 31, 2005, our disclosure backlog was approximately $3,001,000; at December 31, 2004, it was approximately
$2,980,000.            At September 30, 2005, our disclosure backlog was $2,507,000,
indicating that our recent sales growth in disclosure backlog from our industrial, defense, medical and a moderate increase in communications customers may continue in the quarter ending March 31, 2006. This trend is expected to generate a year
over year increase in revenues.             Inventory Levels    We manage our
inventory levels to minimize investment in working capital but still have the flexibility to meet customer demand to a reasonable degree. While the mix of inventory is an important factor, including adequate safety stocks of long lead-time
materials, an important aggregate measure of inventory in all phases of production is the quarter s ending inventory expressed as a number of days worth of the quarter s cost of sales, also known as  days cost of sales in
inventory,  or  DCSI.  It is calculated by dividing the quarter s ending inventory by the quarter s cost of goods sold, multiplied by 365 and divided by 4. Generally, a lower DCSI measure equates to a lesser investment in
inventory and therefore more efficient use of capital. At December 31, 2005, our DCSI was 80 compared to 55 at December 31, 2004. During the first six months of fiscal 2006, we increased our inventory level of traditional optics to meet
the expected demand of the remainder of the fiscal year.             Accounts
Receivable Levels and Quality    Similarly, we manage our accounts receivable to minimize investment in working capital. We measure the quality of receivables by the proportions of the total that are at various increments past due from our
normally extended terms, which are generally 30 days. The most important aggregate measure of accounts         
   14   

Table of Contents  

   receivable is the quarter s ending balance of net accounts receivable expressed as a number of days worth of the
quarter s net revenues, also known as  days sales outstanding,  or  DSO.  It is calculated by dividing the quarters ending net accounts receivable by the quarter s net revenues, multiplied by 365 and divided by 4.
Generally, a lower DSO measure equates to a lesser investment in accounts receivable and therefore more efficient use of capital. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, our DSO was 52.             Other Key Indicators    Other key indicators include various operating metrics, some of which are qualitative and others are
quantitative. These indicators change from time to time as the opportunities and challenges in the business change. They are mostly non-financial indicators such as units of shippable output by major product line, production yield rates by major
product line and the output and yield data from significant intermediary manufacturing processes that support the production of the finished shippable product. These indicators can be used to calculate such other related indicators as fully yielded
unit production per-shift, which varies by the particular product and our state of automation in production of that product at any given time. Higher unit production per shift means lower unit cost and therefore improved margins or improved ability
to compete where desirable for price sensitive customer applications. The data from these reports is used to determine tactical operating actions and changes.         
   Liquidity and Capital Resources             We engage in continuing efforts to keep costs under control as we seek renewed sales growth. Our efforts are directed toward reaching positive cash flow and
profitability. These efforts continue, but may not succeed and we may find it necessary to raise additional capital. Should capital not be available to us at reasonable terms, other actions may become necessary in addition to cost controls and
vigorous sales activities. These actions may include exploring strategic options for the sale of our Company or of some of our product capabilities. We have no firm commitments for any future equity financing at this time and we have a book cash
balance of approximately $796,000 at February 13, 2006.            In the second
quarter of fiscal 2005, we entered into a $75,000 capital equipment lease for equipment to support our molded optics production. We augmented this financing on January 11, 2006, with a four-year secured loan agreement that provides for
borrowings of up to $500,000. If additional capital expenditures are warranted, we may seek similar capital equipment lease financing, however, it is uncertain whether we will be able to consistently gain access to this source of capital.
           Further improvement in cash flow, initially meaning a reduction in cash use,
is expected to be primarily a function of sales increases and, to a lesser extent, margin improvements. Sales increases are expected to be the most important source of future reduction in operating cash outflow. Focused efforts are underway in
order to penetrate new industrial and military optics customers. Actions that support these efforts in the current quarter include new product development and customer prospecting in new targeted markets.            Our fiscal 2006 operating plan and related financial projections anticipate sales growth,
improving margins based on production efficiencies and reductions in both product costs and administrative expenditures. We believe the impact of these factors will be reflected in future quarters. The second quarter results were a marked
improvement over the first, generating 25% gross margin and $2.95 million in revenue with modest positive cash flow from operations.            Factors which could adversely affect cash balances in future quarters include, but are not limited to, a decline in revenue or a lack of anticipated sales growth, poor
cash collections from our accounts receivables, increased material costs, increased labor costs, planned production efficiency improvements not being realized and increases in other discretionary spending, particularly sales and marketing related.
During the second quarter shipments and material purchases were heavier in the end of the quarter than the beginning leading to increased cash usage into the beginning of the proceeding quarter.              Sources and Uses of Cash              Our recurring sources and uses of cash are quite straightforward: we collect receivables
after invoicing customers for product shipments and we pay vendors for materials and services purchased. Other significant uses of cash are payments to employees for wages and compensation and payments to providers of employee benefits. All other
sources and uses of cash are typically immaterial. However we do make expenditures for capital goods, and have received small amounts of cash in the last several quarters for the sale of surplus equipment that we moved from New Mexico or California
attendant to the closure and consolidation of those facilities. For some time the net balance of these cash flows has been negative, meaning a net use of cash. This net use of cash has been met by drawing down on our cash and cash equivalent
balances and raising additional funds through the sale of stock and equipment financing.         
   15   

Table of Contents  

   In the future, we may be required to replenish cash and cash equivalent balances through the sale of equity securities or
by obtaining debt. There can be no assurances that such financing will be available to us and as a result there is significant risk to us in terms of having limited cash resources with which to pursue business opportunities. As a result of this
risk, should it materialize, we may be generally unable to sustain its growth plan or even to maintain its current levels of business. Either of these outcomes would materially adversely affect our results of operations and its stock price.
           There are certain uses of our cash that are contractually or commercially
committed. Those are presented below as of December 31, 2005:             Contractual Obligations   Payments Due By Period             (dollars in 000 s)         
          The
Company does not engage in any activities involving variable interest entities or off-balance sheet financing.              Results of Operations                Fiscal Second Quarter: Three months ended December 31, 2005 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2004               Revenues:             Our revenues totaled approximately $2,954,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2006, a decrease of approximately $360,000, or 11% compared to revenues of $3,314,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The decrease
was primarily attributed to lower volumes of products for communications applications and flat average selling prices. Specifically, average selling prices across all of our product lines accounted for less than $1,000 sales increase, while volume
decreases across three product lines accounted for a $361,000 sales decrease. New products (defined as those introduced in the last twelve months) accounted for sales of $421,000 or 14% of sales in the quarter. New products are defined as unit
volume increases in the price and volume disclosures offered herein.             Cost
of Sales:             In the second quarter of fiscal 2006, consolidated cost of
sales of approximately $2,210,000 was approximately 75% of product sales, versus the comparable period of fiscal 2005 in which we reported cost of sales of approximately $2,766,000, or 83% of product sales. This improvement in gross margin (from 17%
to 25% of sales) is due to reductions in the material, labor and overhead cost components that we are realizing from improved purchasing practices and streamlining operations in our Orlando facility. We continue to focus our efforts on reducing
manufacturing costs as a percentage of sales through cost reductions from more efficient purchasing, manufacturing process and yield improvements as we drive for over 30% of sales.             Selling, General and Administrative:             During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, selling, general and administrative costs (SG A) were approximately $1,120,000, which was a decrease of approximately
$45,000 compared to $1,165,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. This decrease was due to a reduction in insurance, stock compensation and legal and professional expenses, which were partially offset by increased outside services, investor
relations and compensation-related expenses associated with staffing increases in sales and management of our new facility in Shanghai. While in the future we intend to manage SG A costs to be generally in proportion to our business levels, we
are considering adding to our sales force while seeking other cost reductions such as sub-leasing a portion of or restructuring the lease related to the Orlando facility to reduce rent expense.         
   16

    New Product Development:          
  New product development costs (NPD) increased by approximately $2,000 to approximately $245,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 versus $243,000 in the second
quarter of fiscal 2005. We anticipate future increases in staffing levels as we work to meet the volume of specific customer design requests that can lead to new and continued sales.             Amortization of Intangibles:             At the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2006, a major component of our identifiable, amortizing intangible assets from prior acquisitions became fully amortized and,
therefore, for the second fiscal 2006 quarter amortization expense from intangibles was reduced by approximately $30,000 to $8,000 compared to $38,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2005.             Gain on Sales of Assets:             Gain on sale of assets decreased by approximately $8,000 to approximately $3,000 in the
second quarter of fiscal 2006 versus $11,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. In both periods, the gain is from the sale of excess equipment. No significant additional sales or cash proceeds from this excess equipment are expected.   
         Other Income (Expense):             Investment and other income (expense) was a net income of approximately $8,000 in the second
quarter of fiscal 2006 versus a net expense of $7,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. This was caused primarily by a reduction in interest expense of approximately 11,000.             Net Loss:             As a result of the foregoing, net loss was approximately $618,000 during the second quarter of fiscal 2006, compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2005, in which we
reported a net loss of $893,000. This represents a $275,000 decrease. The net loss of $618,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 resulted in a net loss per share of $0.17, an improvement of $0.10 per share compared to the net loss per share of
$0.27 in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Weighted average shares outstanding increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to the second quarter in fiscal 2005 primarily due to the sale of 350,000 shares to private investors in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.              Fiscal First Half: Six months ended
December 31, 2005, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2004.               Revenues:             Our revenues totaled
approximately $5,656,000 for the first six months of fiscal 2006, a decrease of approximately $609,000 or 10% compared to revenues of approximately $6,265,000 for the first six months of fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily attributed to lower
volumes from products for communications applications and flat average selling prices. Specifically, average-selling prices across all of our product lines accounted for approximately a $20,000 sales increase, while volume decreases across three
product lines accounted for a $629,000 sales decrease. Considering the nearly 20% increase in our December 31, 2005 disclosure backlog compared to the September 30, 2005 balance we are anticipating increased revenue on a sequential and
year to year basis. New products (defined as those introduced in the last twelve months) accounted for sales of $821,000 or 14.5% of sales in the quarter. New products are defined as unit volume increases in the price and volume disclosures offered
herein.             Cost of Sales:             In the first six months of fiscal 2006, consolidated cost of sales was approximately
$4,361,000, or 77% of product sales, versus the comparable period of fiscal 2005 in which we reported cost of sales of approximately $5,138,000, or 82% of product sales. This improvement in gross margin (from 18.0% to 22.9% of sales) is due to
reductions in the material, labor and overhead cost components that we are realizing from improved purchasing practices and streamlining operations in our Orlando facility. We continue to focus our efforts on reducing manufacturing costs as a
percentage of sales through cost reductions from more efficient purchasing, manufacturing process and yield improvements as we drive for over 30% of sales             Selling, General and Administrative:             During the first six months of fiscal 2006, selling, general and administrative costs (SG A) of approximately $2,203,000 decreased by approximately $228,000 from
$2,431,000 in the first six months of fiscal 2005. This decrease was due to a reduction in insurance, investor relations, stock compensation and legal and professional expenses, which were partially         
   17   

Table of Contents  

   offset by increased outside services and compensation-related expenses associated with staffing increases in sales and
management of our new facility in Shanghai. While in the future we intend to manage SG A costs to be generally in proportion to our business levels, we are considering adding to our sales force while seeking other cost reductions such as
sub-leasing a portion of or restructuring the lease related to the Orlando facility to reduce rent expense.             New Product Development:             New product
development costs (NPD) decreased by approximately $45,000 to approximately $500,000 in the first six months of fiscal 2006 versus approximately $545,000 in the first six months of fiscal 2005, due primarily to lower spending for outside services
and materials for product development work, which are expensed in the period they are acquired, partially offset by increased compensation costs associated with additional staff.             Amortization of Intangibles:             During the first half of fiscal 2006, a major component of our identifiable, amortizing intangible assets became fully amortized, therefore, there was a substantial
reduction during the period in amortization of intangibles compared to the first six months of fiscal 2005. The resulting decrease was approximately $461,000 to approximately $43,000 in the first six months of fiscal 2006.             Gain on Sales of Assets:             Gain on sale of assets was approximately $9,000 in the first six months of fiscal 2006
compared with $24,000 in the same period of fiscal 2005. In both periods, the gain is from the sale of excess equipment. No significant additional sales or cash proceeds from this excess equipment are expected.             Other Income (Expense):             Investment and other income (expense) was a net income of approximately $15,000 in the first six months of fiscal 2006 versus a net expense
of $146,000 in the first six months of fiscal 2005. This was caused primarily from settlement of a legal claim that resulted in an expense of $70,000, which was recognized in the first six months of fiscal 2005. During the first six months of fiscal
2006, we did not incur amortization expense related to warrant issuance costs; while in the same period in fiscal 2005, we recorded amortization of warrant issuance costs of approximately $79,000 for a warrant that was issued in the first quarter of
fiscal 2004.             Net Loss:             As a result of the foregoing, net loss was approximately $1,426,000 during the six months of
fiscal 2006, compared with the six months of fiscal 2005, in which we reported a net loss of $2,475,000. This represents a $1,049,000 decrease. The net loss of $1,426,000 for the first six months of fiscal 2006 resulted in a net loss per share of
$0.39, an improvement of $0.37 per share compared to the net loss per share of $0.76 in the same period of fiscal 2005. Weighted average shares outstanding increased in the first six months of fiscal 2006 compared to the same period in fiscal 2005
primarily due to the sale of 350,000 shares to private investors in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.             Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates             The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to select appropriate accounting policies, and to make judgments and estimates
affecting the application of those accounting policies. In applying our accounting policies, different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial
Statements.            In response to the Securities and Exchange Commission s (SEC)
Release No. 33-8040,  Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies , we have identified the most critical accounting principles upon which our financial status depends. The critical principles were determined
by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. The most critical accounting principles identified relate to: (i) revenue recognition; (ii) inventory valuation; and
(iii) long-lived assets. These critical accounting policies and our other significant accounting policies are further disclosed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.             Revenue recognition.  We recognize revenue upon shipment of the product provided that persuasive evidence of a final agreement exists,
title has transferred, the selling price is fixed and determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.

    Inventory valuation.  We regularly assess the valuation of inventories and write down those inventories that are
obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage to estimated net realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon the Company s analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected
product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. If market conditions are less favorable than our forecast or actual demand from customers is lower than our estimates, we may be required to record additional inventory
write-downs. If demand is higher than expected, we may be able to use or sell inventories that have previously been written down.             Long-Lived Assets . We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, whenever certain events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances include, but are not limited to, a prolonged industry downturn, a significant decline in our market value, or significant reductions in projected future cash
flows. If facts and circumstances warrant such a review, a long-lived asset would be impaired if future undiscounted cash flows, without consideration of interest, are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. Once deemed
impaired, the long-lived asset is written down to its fair value which could be considerably less than the carrying amount or future undiscounted cash flows. The determination of future cash flows and, if required, fair value of a long-lived asset
is, by its nature, a highly subjective judgment. Fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital. Significant judgments and assumptions are
required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows, including long-term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market, groupings of assets,
discount rate and terminal growth rates. Changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of property and equipment, thereby requiring us to write down the assets.             Intangible Assets . We have obtained intangible assets in connection with a business
unit purchase (for example, in an acquisition). The assignment of value to individual intangible assets generally requires the use of a specialist, such as an appraiser. The assumptions used in the appraisal process are forward-looking, and thus
subject to significant judgment. Because individual intangible assets may be: (i) expensed immediately upon acquisition (for example, purchased in-process research and development assets); or (ii) amortized over their estimated useful life
(for example, acquired technology), their assigned values could have a material affect on current and future period results of operations. Further, intangible assets are subject to the same judgments when evaluating for impairment as other
long-lived assets.             
  Item 3. Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk             We invest a portion of our cash reserves in a money market fund, which invests at least 80% of its net assets in securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and in related repurchase agreements. The money market fund is
not protected under the FDIC; however, we have not experienced any losses in these funds. We do not believe that changes in market interest rates of up to 10 percent in either direction will have any material effect on our results of operations.
            
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures             Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )) as of December 31, 2005, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2005.            During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2005, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.              PART II               
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings             In fiscal 2002,
the Company reached a settlement agreement with participating Class E shareholders regarding the redemption of their outstanding shares. The agreement required the Company to pay $0.40 per share to each Class E shareholder and permitted Class E
shareholders to elect not to participate in the settlement. Since the beginning of fiscal         
   19   

Table of Contents  

   2003, the Company has distributed approximately $.14 million of the $1.5 million estimated total cost arising under the
settlement agreement. Approximately 12% of the former Class E shareholders elected not to participate and commenced a separate action in a Texas state court seeking additional compensation (the  Texas Action ).            In the Texas Action, the Company s motion for Summary Judgment was granted in 2003, and
the plaintiffs  attempts to have that decision reconsidered or overturned have been rejected by the Texas courts in several rulings, including the mot recent decision handed down on December 22, 2005, by the 14   th    District Court of Appeals. The court s ruling affirmed the Company s position and denied the plaintiffs  motion
for a rehearing. The plaintiffs  can elect to appeal the ruling, and at the time of this report the Company has not been notified as to the plaintiffs  decision.            The Company from time to time is involved in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. The Company has been notified
of two employment practices claims from former employees. In one of the employment actions, on November 7, 2005, pursuant to the Company s motion, the magistrate of the 9   th
   Circuit Court, Orange County Florida recommended dismissal of these actions. The plaintiff in that action has filed an appeal, a hearing on which is scheduled for April 2006. The
company has denied any violation related to the second employment claim and has declined to participate in any settlement discussions. To date, the company has received no further notice of actions taken by the claimant. . Based on the current
information, management is not able to estimate the probability of a loss related to these actions.             
  Item 4. Submission of Matters to Vote of Shareholders             The annual meeting of shareholders was held in our Company s offices at 2603 Challenger Tech Ct., Suite 100, Orlando, Florida 32826 on Tuesday, November 8, 2005. The two proposals brought before the
shareholders were:         

1.  
  election, as nominated by the Board of Directors, of Louis Leeburg and Gary Silverman as Class III Directors           
          The total number of shares entitled to vote at the meeting was 3,827,200. As a result of the votes cast, as described below, both nominees were elected for three-year
terms to expire at the Annual Shareholders  Meeting in 2008:         
          Robert Ripp, Robert Bruggeworth,
Sohail Khan, Steven Brueck and Kenneth Brizel were the remaining members of the Board of Directors whose terms continued after the meeting.            As a result of the votes cast, as described below, proposal 2 was approved by the shareholders:            Proposal 2   approve the Company s 2004 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan, which authorizes the issuance of up to 200,000 shares of the Company s common stock.         
          No
other business was brought before the Annual Meeting.

 LOAN AGREEMENT

Loan Agreement 

Exhibit 10.5          

ASSURED SUPPLY AGREEMENT                

BALL
Aerospace   Technologies Corp. ( BALL ), a Delaware corporation with a place of business at 10 Longs Peak Drive, Broomfield, Colorado, and LightPath Technologies, Inc. ( SELLER ), a Delaware corporation with a place of
business at 2603 Challenger Tech Court, Orlando, FL 32826 hereby enter into the following Assured Supply Agreement ( Agreement ) with an effective date of the last date of the signature hereto.             WHEREAS,  BALL requires a reliable and assured supply of Fiber
Mountings for Laser Communications applications (as more fully described in Exhibit A hereto) to meet its requirements (herein referred to as  Goods  and             WHEREAS,  SELLER has expertise in producing Goods that meet BALL s requirements; and             WHEREAS,  BALL is willing to purchase, and SELLER is willing to sell
such Goods from time to time in accordance with the provisions of various requests for proposal ( RFP ) to be issued by BALL;             NOW THEREFORE,  the parties agree that such RFPs shall be governed by the terms and conditions set forth below.         

1.   
   RFPS.  BALL may, from time to time, submit RFPs to SELLER soliciting bids for Goods to be delivered by SELLER in accordance with the terms of the RFP. SELLER agrees to submit
a proposal/response to each BALL RFP (subject to BALL making a no bid decision), and, if selected, to supply such Goods to BALL. As consideration for SELLER s agreement to submit such proposals/responses, BALL agrees to include SELLER on its
bid list (unless otherwise prohibited by BALL s customer) for all future bids for Goods covered by this Agreement. However, this Agreement does not require BALL to submit a minimum number of RFPs; each RFP shall be submitted solely at
BALL s discretion. As a condition precedent to BALL s obligations under this section, SELLER must be on BALL s list of approved bidders for the relevant RFP.           

2.   
   TERM.  Unless terminated earlier pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, the term of this Agreement shall be three (3) years, with a termination date of
September 30, 2008.           

3.   
   PERFORMANCE AND DELIVERY SCHEDULES.  Time is of the essence with respect to delivery and performances. Deliveries of Goods are to be made both in quantities and at time
specified in BALL s schedules. BALL may change or direct temporary suspension of delivery schedules at any time.           

4.   
   NOTICES.  All notices concerning the performance of this Agreement shall be delivered to:           

5.   
   RESTRICTIVE DATA.  The use of BALL s drawings, specifications or information by SELLER in the performance of this Agreement is expressly restricted to SELLER s
provision of Goods to BALL. Any other use or disclosure of this proprietary information of BALL is prohibited. BALL retains all rights in designs, drawings, specifications and other data or papers furnished SELLER in connection with this Agreement.
Upon completion of the work, SELLER shall promptly return to BALL all designs, drawings, specifications and other data or papers furnished by BALL together with all copies or reprints then in SELLER s possession or control.

6.   
   GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement shall be construed according to the laws of the state of Colorado, including its Uniform Commercial Code. All disputes between SELLER and BALL
arising from this Agreement shall be resolved in the state or federal courts of said state. SELLER agrees that it is a  merchant  dealing in Goods of the kind involved in this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the Agreement
and the terms of an individual RFP, the RFP shall take precedence.           

7.   
   WAIVER.  BALL shall not be deemed to have waived any right, power, privilege or remedy unless such waiver is in writing and duly executed by it. No failure to exercise, delay
in exercising or course of dealing with respect to any right, power, privilege or remedy shall be operate as a waiver thereof by BALL or of any other right, power, privilege or remedy. No exercise or partial exercise of any right, power, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof by BALL or the exercise of any other right, power, privilege or remedy by BALL.           

8.   
   THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES.  There are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement.           

9   
   GENERAL.  This Agreement and RFPs issued pursuant to this Agreement contain the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the RFPs and Goods covered by this Agreement,
and all previous contracts, purchase orders, proposals, discussions and communications relating to the RFPs and Goods covered by this Agreement are superseded except to the extent that they have been incorporated by direct reference. Neither this
Agreement, nor any RFP issued hereunder, nor any of the rights or obligations under them may be delegated or assigned by SELLER, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without BALL s express written consent and any contrary
action by SELLER shall be void and without effect. However, this agreement and all the terms hereof shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, and to their respective legal representatives, successors, or assigns, including,
but not limited to, any entities that may acquire the assets and/or equity of SELLER, with the same force and effect as if specifically mentioned in each           
   2   

instance where a party hereto is named. This Agreement may not be amended without BALL s written

Assured Supply Agreement 

Exhibit 10.6               LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT              THIS LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT (the   Agreement  ) is made as of January 11, 2006 by and between
LIGHTPATH TECHNOLOGIES, INC., a Delaware corporation (  Debtor  ) and REGENMACHER HOLDINGS, LTD., a company organized under the Anguilla International Business Companies Act (  Secured Party  ).              RECITALS              1. In connection with a loan given by the Secured Party to the Debtor in an
amount of up to Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($500,000.00) (the  Loan ), Debtor has executed and delivered to the Secured Party a Promissory Note in the principal amount of Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($500,000.00)
dated as of the date hereof (the   Note  ). The parties intend that Debtor s obligations to repay the Note be secured by all of the assets of Debtor described herein.            2. All terms used herein without definition which are defined by the Florida Uniform Commercial Code, as in effect on the
date hereof (the   Code  ) shall have the meanings assigned to them by the Code, unless and to the extent varied by this Agreement.              AGREEMENT              In consideration of the Loan by Secured Party and for other good and valuable consideration, Debtor hereby agrees with Secured Party as follows:

1.  
    Grant of Security Interest; Additional Advances and Fees                (a) To secure Debtor s full and timely performance of all of Debtor s obligations and liabilities to Secured Party pursuant to the Note and this
Agreement (including, without limitation, Debtor s obligation to timely pay the principal amount of, and interest on, the Note, according to the terms contained in the Note) (the   Obligations  ), Debtor hereby grants to Secured
Party a continuing security interest (the   Security Interest  ) in and to all of the property described on  Exhibit A  to this Agreement (the   Collateral  ). The Security Interest shall be subject to the security
interests in the Collateral described in Section 2(a) below.            (b) The initial principal advance to Debtor by Secured Party as of the date hereof is zero ($0.00) (the  Borrowing Base  provided Debtor is in compliance with its Obligations, the Borrowing Base may be increased up to a maximum
Borrowing Base of $500,000 provided incremental advance amounts provided to or for the benefit of Debtor are used solely for the purchase by Debtor from the original equipment manufacturer (or authorized dealer or other representative thereof) of
items of new equipment of the type or satisfying the criteria described in  Exhibit B  attached hereto. Secured Party may require as a condition to any such advance, that any such advance be paid by it directly to such manufacturer or
representative and such evidence of authenticity and value as deemed appropriate by Secured Party in its reasonable discretion. All such equipment shall become Collateral hereunder by appropriate amendment to this Agreement and subject to
appropriately executed and filed Uniform Commercial Code Financing Statements or amendments thereto, as a condition to any such advance.            (c) In the event Debtor desires to obtain advances after the date hereof, for each advance requested, the Debtor shall notify the Secured Party by
completing an Advance Request, substantially in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit D , and submitting the same to the Secured Party no later than 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) at least three (3) Business Days (as defined below)
prior to the date of such proposed advance, specifying (i) the date of the proposed advance (which shall be a   

Business Day and (ii) the amount of such requested advance.  Business Day  shall mean any day other than
Saturday or Sunday or a legal holiday on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law to be closed for business in Orlando, Florida. Interest on such advances shall begin to accrue on the day of the advance and be added to the total
principal amount of the Note.            (d) Should there be
attorneys  fees, appraisal costs, filing fees, taxes and the like associated with the preparation of the Loan Documents and the closing of the Loan or enforcement of the Loan Documents or the Obligations or any Advance Request, all such costs
and fees shall be the responsibility of the Debtor.            (e) In
connection with the initial funding under the Note, Debtor shall pay to the Secured Party a $5,000.00 facility fee, which is one percent (1%) of the maximum Borrowing Base of $500,000.00 (the  Facility Fee ).            Upon satisfaction of the Obligations, the Security Interest shall terminate
and all rights to the Collateral shall revert to Debtor. Upon any such termination, Secured Party shall authenticate and deliver to Debtor such documents as Debtor may reasonably request to evidence or effect such termination.            2.   Covenants .  Debtor covenants and agrees with Secured Party
that, from and after the date of this Agreement until the Obligations are paid in full:            (a)   Other Liens .  The Security Interest shall constitute a first priority lien upon the Collateral. Except for the Security Interest, Debtor is the owner of the Collateral and will be the owner of the
Collateral hereafter acquired free from any adverse lien, security interest or encumbrance (other than purchase money security interests that will be discharged upon Debtor s payment of the purchase price for the applicable property), and
Debtor will defend the Collateral against the claims and demands of all persons at any time claiming the same or any interest therein. No financing statements covering any Collateral or any proceeds thereof are on file in any public office except
for the financing statements in favor of Secured Party.            (b)
  Landlord Waiver  . The Debtor will obtain a Landlord Waiver substantially in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit C , whereby the landlord of the property (the  Landlord ) where the Debtor conducts its business (the
 Property ) and where the Collateral is housed will waive its priority lien and security rights with respect to the Collateral, as defined herein, in favor of Secured Party.            (c)   Further Documentation .  At any time and from time to time, upon the written request of Secured Party, and
at the sole expense of Debtor, Debtor will promptly and duly execute and deliver such further instruments and documents and take such further action as Secured Party may reasonably request for the purpose of obtaining or preserving the full benefits
of this Agreement and of the rights and powers herein granted, including, without limitation, filing any financing or continuation statements under the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in any jurisdiction with respect to the liens created hereby.
Debtor also hereby authorizes Secured Party to file any such financing or continuation statement without the signature of Debtor to the extent permitted by applicable law. A reproduction of this Agreement shall be sufficient as a financing statement
(or as exhibit to a form UCC financing statement for filing in any jurisdiction).            (d)   Indemnification .  Debtor agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Secured Party against any and all liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses):
(i) with respect to, or resulting from, any delay in paying, any and all excise, sales or other taxes which may be payable or determined to be payable with respect to any of the Collateral, (ii) with respect to, or resulting from, any
delay in complying with any law, rule, regulation or order of any governmental authority applicable to any of the Collateral or (iii) in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.         
   2   

(e)   Maintenance of Records .  Debtor will keep and maintain, at its own cost and expense,
satisfactory and complete records of the Collateral.            (f)
  Maintenance of Collateral  . Debtor will keep and maintain, at its own cost and expense, satisfactory mechanical and working order of the Collateral.            (g)   Inspection Rights .  Secured Party shall have full access during normal business hours, and upon reasonable
prior notice, to all the books, correspondence and other records of Debtor relating to the Collateral, and Secured Party or their representatives may examine such records and make photocopies or otherwise take extracts from such records. Debtor
agrees to render to Secured Party, at Debtor s expense, such clerical and other assistance as may be reasonably requested with regard to the exercise of its rights pursuant to this paragraph.            (h)   Compliance with Laws, etc.   Debtor will comply in all
material respects with all laws, rules, regulations and orders of any governmental authority applicable to any part of the Collateral or to the operation of Debtor s business, including timely filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission ( SEC ) of all reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), copies of which shall be provided to Secured Party during the term of this Agreement, and
shall submit, from time to time, at the Secured Party s request, a Compliance Certificate, substantially in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit E  evidencing such compliance. Debtor may, however, contest any such law, rule, regulation or
order in any reasonable manner which does not, in the reasonable opinion of Debtor, materially adversely affect Secured Party  rights or the priority of their liens on the Collateral.            (i)   Payment of Obligations .  Debtor will pay promptly prior to
delinquency all taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon the Collateral or with respect to any of its income or profits derived from the Collateral, as well as all claims of any kind (including, without limitation, claims
for labor, materials and supplies) against or with respect to the Collateral, except that no such charge need be paid if (i) the validity of such charge is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, (ii) such proceedings do
not involve any material danger of the sale, forfeiture or loss of any of the Collateral or any interest in the Collateral and (iii) such charge is adequately reserved against on Debtor s books in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.            (j)   Limitation on Liens on
Collateral .  Debtor will not create, incur or permit to exist, will defend the Collateral against, and will take such other action as is necessary to remove, any lien or claim on or to the Collateral, other than the Security Interest, and
will defend the right, title and interest of Secured Party in and to any of the Collateral against the claims and demands of all other persons.            (k)  Limitations on Dispositions of Collateral . Debtor will not sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of any of the Collateral, or attempt,
offer or contract to do so.            (l)   Further Identification
of Collateral .  Debtor will furnish to Secured Party from time to time statements and schedules further identifying and describing the Collateral and such other reports in connection with the Collateral as Secured Party may reasonably
request, all in reasonable detail.            (m)   Insurance .
 The Collateral at all times shall be maintained in accordance with the material requirements of all insurance carriers which provide insurance with respect to the Collateral so that such insurance shall remain in full force and effect.
           The Debtor shall bear the full risk of any loss of any nature
whatsoever with respect to the Collateral. At the Debtor s own cost and expense in amounts and with carriers reasonably acceptable to the Secured Party, the Debtor shall keep the Collateral insured against the hazards of fire, flood, sprinkler
leakage, those hazards covered by extended coverage insurance and such other hazards, and for         
   3   

such amounts, as is customary in the case of companies engaged in businesses similar to the Debtor s and furnish the
Secured Party with appropriate loss payable endorsements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Secured Party, naming the Secured Party as a loss payee as its interests may appear but only with respect to insurance coverage covering
damage, loss or destruction of the Collateral, and providing (A) that all proceeds thereunder covering a loss of or damage to Collateral shall be payable to the Secured Party, (B) no such insurance shall be affected by any act or neglect
of the insured or owner of the property described in such policy, and (C) that such policy and loss payable clauses may not be cancelled, amended or terminated unless at least thirty (30) days  prior written notice is given to the
Secured Party. The Debtor shall provide copies of all such insurance policies (including the appropriate lender loss payee and additional insured endorsements) at closing and within twenty (20) days after the Secured Party s request. In
the event of any loss under any insurance covering Collateral, the carriers named in such insurance policies covering Collateral hereby are directed by the Debtor and the Debtor to make payment for such loss to the Secured Party and not to the
Secured Party and the Debtor jointly. If any insurance losses with respect to Collateral are paid by check, draft or other instrument payable to the Debtor or to the Secured Party and the Debtor jointly, the Debtor shall endorse the Debtor s
name thereon and do such other things as the Secured Party may deem advisable to reduce the same to cash. The Secured Party is hereby authorized to adjust and compromise claims under insurance coverage with respect to Collateral. All loss recoveries
with respect to Collateral received by the Secured Party upon any such insurance may be applied to the Obligations, in such order as the Secured Party in its sole discretion shall determine. Any surplus with respect to Collateral shall be paid by
the Secured Party to the Debtor or applied as may be otherwise required by law. Any deficiency thereon shall be paid by the Debtor to the Secured Party, on demand.            3.   Event of Default .  The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute an  Event of Default 
under this Agreement:            (a) Debtor fails to make any payment of
principal or interest under the Note when due.            (b) Debtor
breaches any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Debtor in this Agreement, and fails to cure such breach (if such breach is curable) within 30 days after receipt of written notice thereof from Secured Party to Debtor.   
        (c) Debtor defaults in any of its material obligations under any other
document executed in connection with this Agreement, and fails to cure such default (if such default is curable) within 30 days after receipt of written notice thereof from Secured Party to Debtor.            (d) Debtor shall:            (i) Become insolvent or generally fail to pay, or admit in writing its
inability to pay, debts as they become due;            (ii) Apply for,
consent to or acquiesce in the appointment of a trustee, receiver, sequestrator or other custodian for the Debtor or any property of thereof or make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors;            (iii) In the absence of such application, consent to, acquiesce in, permit
or suffer to exist the appointment of a trustee, receiver, sequestrator, liquidator, assignee, custodian or other similar official for the Debtor or property of thereof; or            (iv) Permit or suffer to exist the commencement of any bankruptcy, reorganization, debt arrangement or other case or
proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, or any dissolution, winding up or liquidation proceeding in respect of the Debtor, and, if such case or         
   4   

proceeding is not commenced by the Debtor, such case or proceeding shall be consented to or acquiesced in by the Debtor
or shall result in the entry of an order for relief or shall not be vacated, stayed, or dismissed within sixty (60) days after such case or proceeding is commenced.            4.   Secured Party s Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact .             (a) If Debtor fails to perform any agreement contained herein, the Secured
Party may itself perform, or cause performance of, such agreement, and the expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be payable to Secured Party under Section 5.            (b) The powers conferred on Secured Party by this Section 4 are solely to protect Secured Party s interests in the
Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. Secured Party shall be accountable only for amounts that it actually receives as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither Secured Party nor any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents shall, in the absence of willful misconduct or gross negligence, be responsible to Debtor for any act or failure to act pursuant to this Section 4.            5.   Performance by Secured Party of Debtor s Obligations . 
If Debtor fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements or covenants contained in this Agreement and Secured Party performs or complies, or otherwise causes performance or compliance, with such agreement or covenant in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, then the reasonable expenses of Secured Party incurred in connection with such performance or compliance shall be payable by Debtor to Secured Party on demand and shall constitute Obligations secured by this Agreement.
           6.   Remedies .  If an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, Secured Party may exercise, in addition to all other rights and remedies granted to it in this Agreement and in any other instrument or agreement relating to the Obligations, all rights and remedies of a secured party under the
Code. Without limiting the foregoing, Secured Party, without demand of performance or other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice required by law) to or upon Debtor or any other person (all of which
demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may in such circumstances collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon any or all of the Collateral, and/or may sell, lease, assign, give option or options to purchase, or otherwise
dispose of and deliver any or all of the Collateral (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any exchange, broker s board or office of a Secured Party or elsewhere upon such terms
and conditions as Secured Party may deem advisable, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk. Secured Party shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon
any such private sale or sales, to purchase all or any part of the Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption in Debtor, which right or equity is hereby waived or released. Secured Party shall apply the net proceeds of any such
collection, recovery, receipt, appropriation, realization or sale, after deducting all reasonable expenses incurred therein or connection with the care or safekeeping of any of the Collateral or in any way relating to the Collateral or the rights of
Secured Party under this Agreement (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees and expenses) to the payment in whole or in part of the Obligations, in such order as Secured Party may elect, and only after such application and
after the payment by Secured Party of any other amount required by any provision of law, need Secured Party account for the surplus, if any, to Debtor. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Debtor waives all claims, damages and demands it may
acquire against Secured Party arising out of the exercise by Secured Party of any of its rights hereunder. If any notice of a proposed sale or other disposition of Collateral shall be required by law, such notice shall be deemed reasonable and
proper if given at least five (5) days before such sale or other disposition. Debtor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay the Obligations and the fees
and disbursements of any attorneys employed by Secured Party to collect such deficiency.         
   5   

7.   Limitation on Duties Regarding Preservation of Collateral .  The sole duty of a Secured
Party with respect to the custody, safekeeping and preservation of the Collateral, under Section 679.2071 of the Code or otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the same manner as such Secured Party deals with similar property for its own
account. Neither Secured Party nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon all or any part of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to
sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of Debtor or otherwise.            8.   Powers Coupled with an Interest .  All authorizations and agencies contained in this Agreement with respect the Collateral are irrevocable and powers coupled with an interest.            9.   No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies .  Secured Party shall not by
any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to Section 10(a) hereof), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any default under the Note or in any breach of
any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of Secured Party, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any
right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by Secured Party of any right or remedy under this Agreement on any one occasion shall not be
construed as a bar to any right or remedy which Secured Party would otherwise have on any subsequent occasion. The rights and remedies provided in this Agreement are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any
rights or remedies provided by law.            10.
  Miscellaneous .             (a)   Amendments and
Waivers .  This Agreement may be amended only with the written consent of Debtor and Secured Party. Any amendment or waiver effected in accordance with this Section 10(a) shall be binding upon the parties and their respective successors
and assigns.            (b)   Transfer; Successors and
Assigns .  The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be binding upon Debtor and its successors and assigns and inure to the benefit of Secured Party and its successors and assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any party other than the parties hereto or their respective successors and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations, or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.
           (c)   Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Venue .  This
Agreement and all acts and transactions pursuant hereto and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be executed in Orange County, Florida and shall be interpreted, construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of
Florida ,  without regard to the principles of conflict of laws.            DEBTOR
AGREES THAT ALL ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS ARISING DIRECTLY, INDIRECTLY, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH, OUT OF, RELATED TO OR FROM THIS NOTE SHALL BE LITIGATED ONLY IN COURTS HAVING A SITUS WITHIN ORANGE COUNTY, FLORIDA. DEBTOR AND HOLDER, HEREBY
CONSENT AND SUBMIT TO THE JURISDICTION OF ANY LOCAL, STATE, OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED WITHIN OR FOR SUCH COUNTY AND STATE. DEBTOR AND HOLDER HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THEY MAY HAVE TO TRANSFER OR CHANGE THE VENUE OF ANY LITIGATION BROUGHT AGAINST EITHER
OF THEM WITH RESPECT TO THE LOAN OR ANY MATTER RELATED THERETO, INCLUDING ANY ACTION UNDER THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PARAGRAPH.         
   6   

(d)   Counterparts .  This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one instrument.            (e)   Titles and Subtitles .  The titles and subtitles used in this Agreement are used for convenience only and are not to be considered in construing or interpreting this Agreement.            (f)   Notices .  Any notice required or permitted by this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficient upon receipt, when delivered personally or by courier, overnight delivery service or confirmed facsimile, or three (3) business days after being deposited in the U.S. mail as certified or
registered mail with postage prepaid, if such notice is addressed to the party to be notified at such party s address or facsimile number as set forth below on the signature page, or as subsequently modified by written notice.            (g)   Severability .  If one or more provisions of this Agreement
are held to be unenforceable under applicable law, the parties agree to renegotiate such provision in good faith in order to maintain the economic position enjoyed by each party as close as possible to that under the provision rendered
unenforceable. In the event that the parties cannot reach a mutually agreeable and enforceable replacement for such provision, then (i) such provision shall be excluded from this Agreement, (ii) the balance of the Agreement shall be
interpreted as if such provision were so excluded and (iii) the balance of the Agreement shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.            (h)   Accuracy of Information  . All information provided to Secured Party or its agents by Debtor with respect to the Debtor and the Collateral
including, without limitation, the information contained in Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act from and after January 1, 2004, was, at the time the same was provided or filed, as the case may be, true and correct
in all material respects.            (i)   Entire Agreement .
 This Agreement, and the documents referred to herein constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and any and all other written or oral agreements existing between the parties hereto
concerning such subject matter are expressly canceled.            Debtor
and Secured Party have caused this Agreement to be duly executed and delivered as of the date first above written.
