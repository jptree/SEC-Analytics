BIONUTRICS, INC.
              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                   (UNAUDITED)

Note A -      BASIS OF PRESENTATION

                     The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
              Statements of Bionutrics,  Inc. (the "Company") have been prepared
              in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
              United States of America for interim financial information and the
              instructions  to Form 10-Q.  Accordingly,  they do not include all
              the  information and footnotes  required by accounting  principles
              generally  accepted in the United  States of America for  complete
              financial   statements.   In  the  opinion  of   management,   all
              adjustments  (which  include  only normal  recurring  adjustments)
              necessary to present  fairly the  financial  position,  results of
              operations  and cash  flows for all  periods  presented  have been
              made. The results of operations for the  three-month  period ended
              January 31, 2006 are not  necessarily  indicative of the operating
              results  that may be expected  for the entire year ending  October
              31,  2006.  These  unaudited  condensed   consolidated   financial
              statements  should  be  read in  conjunction  with  the  Company's
              financial  statements and accompanying notes thereto as of and for
              the year  ended  October  31,  2005.  The  accompanying  condensed
              consolidated  financial  statements  have been prepared on a going
              concern basis,  which  contemplates  the realization of assets and
              the  satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
              The  Company  has  incurred   accumulated   operating   losses  of
              $46,030,717  through  January  31,  2006  which  have been  funded
              through  the  issuance of stock and debt.  The losses  incurred to
              date, the  uncertainty  regarding the ability to raise  additional
              capital and the Company's  inability to generate gross profits and
              positive cash flows from operations  indicate that the Company may
              not be able to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period
              of time.

Note B -      NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE

                     Basic net loss per share is computed  by  dividing  the net
              loss by the weighted  average number of common shares  outstanding
              during the presented  periods.  Diluted net loss per share has not
              been presented as it was  anti-dilutive.  Options and warrants are
              excluded from the diluted net loss per share calculation,  as they
              are anti-dilutive.

Note C -      LICENSE AGREEMENT

                     The Technology License Agreement (the "License  Agreement")
              dated March 16, 2005 entered  into with  Nostrum  Pharmaceuticals,
              Inc  ("Nostrum")  and the  Company,  replaced in its  entirety the
              Product  Development  and License  Agreement  dated as of June 16,
              2004. Under the revised License Agreement, the Company received an
              exclusive  license  to develop  and  commercialize  ten  505(b)(2)
              products  (brandable  pharmaceutical  products  that  qualify  for
              filing with the United  States Food and Drug  Administration  (the
              "FDA") under a "505(b)(2)"  application)  and ten generic products
              (generic  bio-equivalents  of branded

                                       7

products  which  qualify  for filing  with the FDA  pursuant to an
              Abbreviated  New Drug  Application)  under the Nostrum  Technology
              within a three  year  period.  As  consideration  for the  License
              Agreement,  the  Company  issued 12  million  shares of its common
              stock, and agreed to pay Nostrum royalties on net sales of generic
              products equal to 50% of gross profit. As of January 31, 2006, the
              Company  has  paid  $1,615,090  to  Nostrum  as  remuneration  for
              research  and  development  costs  associated  with  the  licensed
              technology.

Note D -      PURCHASE AGREEMENT

                     In July 2005, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement
              (the "Purchase Agreement") to acquire Kirk  Pharmaceuticals,  LLC,
              and its  affiliate,  ANDAPharm,  LLC  (collectively,  "Kirk")  for
              $12,000,000 in cash and a promissory note. Kirk is a Florida based
              pharmaceutical company that manufactures  over-the-counter ("OTC")
              and  generic  prescription  drugs  in its  FDA  and  DEA  approved
              facility.  Kirk currently manufactures and/or markets 30 OTC solid
              dose and soft gel pharmaceuticals under current Good Manufacturing
              Practices  ("cGMP")  guidelines.  Kirk was founded in 1999 and has
              grown to more than 100 people and occupies  70,000  square feet of
              manufacturing   space.   If  the  Company  is  successful  in  its
              acquisition  of Kirk,  the  Company  intends  to fund  some of its
              planned  clinical  trials and product  development  programs  with
              potential   cash  flow  from   Kirk's   operations.   The  Company
              anticipates  that  Kirk  will  be  the  designated   manufacturing
              facility for its products,  subsequent to FDA approval.  As of the
              date herein,  the Company is awaiting  approval of the acquisition
              from the Drug Enforcement Agency ("DEA").

Note E -      PLACEMENT AGENCY AGREEMENT

                     On September 27, 2005, the Company entered into a Placement
              Agency  Agreement with Indigo  Securities LLC, a Delaware  limited
              liability company ("Indigo") whereby,  Indigo agreed to act as the
              Registrant's  agent  in  connection  with  (i)  the  sale  by  the
              Registrant of from $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 million,  face amount
              of the  Company's 10% Senior  Notes,  to be offered  together with
              warrants, (ii) the sale (the "Bridge Financing") by the Company of
              up to  $2,500,000,  face amount of the  Company's  9%  Convertible
              Bridge Notes (the "Bridge  Notes"),  to be offered  together  with
              warrants (the "Bridge Warrants") and (iii) the sale by the Company
              of up to $5  million  of  Series  A  Convertible  Preferred  Stock
              ("Series  A  Preferred   Stock")  of  the  Company  together  with
              warrants,  all of which will be  offered  on terms and  conditions
              agreed upon by the Parties. As of the date herein, the Company has
              issued $3,095,000 under the 9% Convertible Bridge Notes. No Series
              A Convertible Preferred Stock has been issued.

Note F -      PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT

                     InCon Technologies,  Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
              Company,    and   Asia   Pacific   Investment   Holdings   Limited
              (collectively,  the  "Sellers"),  entered into a Purchase and Sale
              Agreement,   dated  as  of  October   31,   2005  (the   "Purchase
              Agreement"),  pursuant to which the  Sellers  agreed to sell their

                                       8

respective  fifty  percent  (50%)  ownership  interests  in  InCon
              Processing,  LLC  ("InCon"),  to  InCon  International,   Inc.  in
              exchange for all of the  membership  units of Bali  Holdings,  LLC
              ("Bali")  which are owned by N.P.  Shaikh  ("Shaikh")  and John R.
              Palmer   ("Palmer").   The  sale  was  made  upon  the   Company's
              determination that InCon's operations,  which includes high vacuum
              distillation,  production toll work and process development, would
              no longer  comprise a material  element in the Company's  business
              strategy.

                     Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Sellers have agreed
              to provide  consulting  services  to InCon for a term of three (3)
              years in consideration  for an annual consulting fee in the amount
              of the lesser of: (a) One Hundred Thousand  Dollars  ($100,000.00)
              and (b)  twenty-five  percent  (25%) of  InCon's  annual  earnings
              before interest,  taxes,  depreciation  and amortization  over the
              five (5) years beginning on October 31, 2005  ("Consulting  Fee");
              provided  however,  that the total payments to each of the Sellers
              in respect of the  Consulting  Fee shall not exceed Three  Hundred
              Thousand Dollars  ($300,000.00).  The Consulting Fee is subject to
              certain  acceleration  provisions  as  provided  in  the  Purchase
              Agreement.

                     As a  condition  to  the  Closing  of  the  sale  of  InCon
              membership   interests,   InCon  is   obligated  to  complete  the
              development  of certain  tocotrienol  processing  technology  (the
              "Technology") and to convey the sole right, ownership and interest
              in the  Technology  to the Sellers who shall  thereafter  have the
              exclusive  right to patent,  license or sell the Technology in its
              sole discretion. While management believes that InCon will deliver
              the technology, no assurance can be given that the technology will
              be received or that the sale will be consummated.

Note G -      FINANCING COMMITMENT

                     In November,  2005, the Company  received a commitment from
              BHC Interim Funding II L.P., a merchant  banking firm ("BHC"),  to
              lend up to $10 million to a newly-formed subsidiary of the Company
              for  the  purpose  of  acquiring  Kirk.  Funding  pursuant  to the
              Commitment   is  subject   to   satisfactory   legal   review  and
              documentation,  no material adverse changes, as well as additional
              terms  and   conditions.   The  loan  from  BHC  (the  "Loan")  is
              anticipated  to be structured as senior secured  indebtedness,  of
              which  $8,000,000  will be drawn at closing (the "Initial  Loan"),
              and an incremental  $2,000,000 credit facility (the "Facility") to
              be available  on the six month  anniversary  of the  closing.  The
              Facility  will  constitute  an  additional  draw  under  the  loan
              documents.  The Loan will have an interest  rate of 12% per annum,
              payable  monthly  in  arrears,  and will  mature on the date three
              years  from the date of the  closing of the  acquisition  of Kirk.
              There will also be a maintenance fee,  adjusted  periodically,  to
              achieve an accrual  rate of 4.75%.  The Loan is not  subject to an
              amortization schedule and may be prepaid at any time. In the event
              the  Loan is not  paid in full at  maturity,  notwithstanding  any
              other  penalties  that  may be  paid,  and  notwithstanding  BHC's
              rights,  actions  and  efforts to pursue  repayment,  the  Company
              shall,  among other things,  after a 15-day cure period pay a cash
              fee of 5.0% of the amount then outstanding to BHC.

                                       9

The Company will be required to utilize the proceeds of any
              new senior or  subordinated  debt or equity or other new financing
              by or investment in the Company,  as well as the proceeds from the
              sale of any assets outside the ordinary  course of business or the
              sale or merger of the Company to repay the Investment.

                     The Company shall be required to pay a 3.0% transaction fee
              based  upon  the  amount  funded  and,   upon   repayment  of  the
              Investment,  will be required to pay maintenance  fees prorated to
              reflect the time and principal amount of the Investment.

                     The Loan shall be secured by a first  priority  lien on all
              existing and future tangible and intangible  assets owned by Kirk.
              Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  Loan  will  have  a  second
              priority lien on specific  tangible assets that, after the closing
              of the acquisition of Kirk, are financed with equipment loans. The
              Loan  will be  further  secured  by:  (i) a pledge  of 100% of the
              Company's interest in Kirk; (ii) a pledge of 100% of the Company's
              interest in ANDAPharm,  LLC, (iii) the corporate guarantees of the
              Company and ANDAPharm,  LLC, and (iv) a first priority lien on the
              Company's  technology,  including  its  products  derived from its
              license agreement with Nostrum Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. However, the
              lien granted to BHC shall not  preclude the Company from  entering
              into  agreements  related to its technology in the ordinary course
              of business, so long as no event of default has occurred under the
              loan documents.

                     Further,  upon the  closing of the Loan,  BHC will have the
              right to a 5-year warrant to purchase  shares of 125,000 shares of
              common  stock of the  Company  for $4.00 per  share,  subject to a
              number of conditions.

                     While the Initial Loan is  outstanding,  BHC shall (a) have
              observation  rights  to Board of  Directors  and  Audit  Committee
              meetings  of  the  Company  and  Kirk,  (b)  be  given  reasonable
              notification of such meeting dates, and (c) be entitled to receive
              copies of all  written  information  and  notices  provided to the
              Board of  Directors  and Audit  Committee  at the same time as the
              members.  In the event of a payment default under the Initial Loan

              principal  amount  of  9%  convertible   notes  (the  "Convertible
              Notes"),  which are convertible into an aggregate of 33,333 shares
              of  Company  common  stock at a price of $3.00,  and  warrants  to
              purchase an aggregate of 16,666 shares of Company  common stock at
              $4.00 per share (the  "Private  Warrants").  These  Warrants  were
              valued at $32,583 using the Black Scholes  Model,  assuming a life
              of three years, volatility of 550%, and a risk free borrowing rate
              of 3.25% and will be charged to interest  expense over the life of
              the debt  commencing in 2006. In connection  with this  financing,
              the Company paid a cash private placement fee of $9,000.

ITEM 2.       MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND
              RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE FOLLOWING  DISCUSSION OF THE  COMPANY'S  FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS  INCLUDES  CERTAIN  FORWARD-LOOKING  STATEMENTS.  WHEN  USED  IN THIS
REPORT,  THE WORDS "EXPECTS,"  "INTENDS,"  "PLANS" AND "ANTICIPATES" AND SIMILAR
TERMS ARE  INTENDED TO IDENTIFY  FORWARD-LOOKING  STATEMENTS  THAT RELATE TO THE
COMPANY'S FUTURE  PERFORMANCE.  SUCH STATEMENTS INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.
THE COMPANY'S  ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER  MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS  DISCUSSED
HERE.  FACTORS THAT MIGHT CAUSE SUCH A DIFFERENCE  INCLUDE,  BUT ARE NOT LIMITED
TO, THOSE DISCUSSED UNDER "RISK FACTORS" IN THE COMPANY'S FORM 10-K.

OUR BUSINESS

       Bionutrics,  Inc. is a pharmaceutical company focusing on the development
of  oral   controlled-release   drug  formulations  utilizing  proprietary  drug
formulations  and delivery  technologies.  The Company has licensed  proprietary
oral-control  release  technology  with the  rights to develop  exclusively  and
worldwide,  ten  generic  and ten  505(b)(2)  drugs  (improved  formulations  of
previously  approved  drugs).  The Company intends to invest the majority of its
resources in the development and  commercialization of these products during the
next few years.

GENERAL

       The  Company  is a  development  stage  company  and  is  anticipating  a
prolonged  period of losses  and  negative  cash  flows  while it  develops  and
commences  commercialization  of its  planned  products.  The  Company's  future
operating results will depend largely on its ability to achieve the following:

       -  Debt and equity  financing  to support the  research  and  development
          activities

       -  Successful completion of the Kirk acquisition

       -  Successful development and testing of product candidates

       -  Receipt of required regulatory approvals related to product candidates

       -  Commercialization of the Company's products

       -  Gaining a competitive position in the market

DEVELOPMENTS DURING THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2006

       In January 2006, the Company  announced that it has initiated the process
for  its  first  controlled-release  generic  drug  candidate,   SNG1001a,  with
chemical,  manufacturing  and control  ("CMC")  development.  Concurrently,  the
Company will conduct pivotal biostudies to demonstrate  "bioequivalency"  as the
Company moves this first product  towards  commercialization.  These efforts are
intended to provide  confirmation of the  formulation and biostudies  previously
undertaken in India.  Successful  completion of these efforts is  anticipated to
result in the Company's first  Abbreviated New Drug Application  ("ANDA") filing
with the

                                       12

FDA.  SNG1001a is a formulated  generic version of a branded drug in a treatment
category with annualized US sales in excess of $1.4 billion  (Source:  IMS). The
Company can provide no assurance that its clinical trials will prove  successful
or that it will demonstrate  sufficient evidence to file an ANDA filing with the
FDA.

FOCUS FOR REMAINDER OF 2006

       The  Company's  primary  focus  for  the  remainder  of  2006  will be to
consummate the acquisition of Kirk  Pharmaceuticals and its affiliate ANDAPharm.
The Company will also  continue its efforts to secure debt and equity  financing
to support operations,  further its "bioequivalency"  study of SNG1001a, as well
as to further its research and  development  program on other drug candidates in
order to be in a position to realize the potential of its licensed technology.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2006 COMPARED WITH THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,
2005.

       Consolidated  gross  revenues for the quarter  ended January 31, 2006 was
$1,600 compared to $3,000 for the same quarter in 2005.

       The Company has been  unprofitable  since  inception,  and  continues  to
generate  limited  revenue  as  the  Company's  subsidiary,   Bionutrics  Health
Products, sells through its remaining evolvE(R) inventory, a product which is no
longer  being  marketed  or  developed  due to the  Company's  shift in business
strategy from the discovery and  development  of  pharmaceutical  and functional
nutrition   products  to  the  development  of  oral   controlled-release   drug
formulations  utilizing proprietary drug formulation and delivery  technologies.
The Company does not anticipate sales from evolvE(R) beyond this fiscal year.

       The Company expects to continue to incur  operating  losses as it invests
in product  development  and clinical trials  research.  The Company is pursuing
potential  development  and  marketing  arrangements  with other  pharmaceutical
companies  regarding its licensed products.  However,  there can be no assurance
that the Company will be  successful  in these  efforts or that any  arrangement
would generate sufficient revenue to fund operations.

       Cost of revenues  for the three  months  ended  January 31, 2006 was $250
compared to $500 for the same three months in 2005.

       Research and development  expenses for the three months ended January 31,
2006 was  $161,000  compared to $3,000 for the same three  months in 2005.  This
increase is due to the remuneration of research and development costs associated
with the Nostrum  licensed  technology  of $107,000,  as well as $54,000 in fees
associated with the development of SNG1001a.

       Operating  expenses  for the three  months  ended  January  31,  2006 was
$747,000  compared to $305,000.  This  increase is due  primarily to $261,000 in
additional salary expense for

                                       13

increased staffing needs, $127,000 in recruiting fees, and $56,000 in additional
consulting  expense,  all of which are  necessary to  accomplish  the  Company's
business objectives and increased business activities.

       The Company's  loss in the results of operations  for it's  investment in
joint  venture,  which is accounted for using the equity  method,  for the three
months ended January 31, 2006, was $78,000. The Company records its share of the
joint venture's loss for the quarter as a decrease in its investment.

       The net loss of  $1,199,000  or $.05 per share for the three months ended
January  31,  2006 was due  primarily  to the  Company's  inability  to generate
sufficient cash flow to support operations.  The Company also expects cumulative
losses to increase due to its research and development activities related to the
License Agreement with Nostrum.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

       To date, the Company's  operations have not generated sufficient revenues
to satisfy the Company's  operating  capital needs. The Company has financed its
operations primarily through the sale of its common stock,  warrants and debt by
means of  private  placements.  The  Company  had a working  capital  deficit of
approximately  $3,892,000  at January 31, 2006 as compared  with  $3,913,000  at
October 31, 2005. Cash and cash  equivalents  were $222,000 at January 31, 2006,
as compared with $129,000 at October 31, 2005, an increase of $93,000.

       Net cash used in operating activities during the three-month period ended
January 31, 2006 was  $820,000.  This  resulted  from the  Company's net loss of
$1,199,000,  offset in part by certain  non-cash items  attributable to expenses
including,  but not limited to a reduction of its investment in InCon Processing
of $78,000,  amortization  of bridge note  discount  of  $192,000,  depreciation
expense of $9,000, and an increase in accounts payable of $128,000.  The Company
has generally  incurred  negative cash flows from  operations  since  inception,
which will continue due to research and  development  activities  related to the
License Agreement with Nostrum.

       Net cash used in  investing  activities  during  the three  months  ended
January 31,  2006 was  $98,000.  This  resulted  from  capital  expenditures  of
equipment of $13,000 and deferred fees associated  with the Kirk  acquisition of
$85,000.

       Net cash provided by financing  activities  during the three months ended
January 31, 2006 was  $1,012,000,  which  resulted  from the proceeds of debt of
$1,150,000,  less fees  associated  with the debt  issuance of $110,000  and the
repayment of $28,000 in debt.

       The  Company  did  not  enter  into  any  material  capital   expenditure
agreements,  nor did it engage in any off  balance  sheet  financing  during the
reporting period.

The following  table depicts our  obligations  and commitments as of January 31,
2006 to make future payments under existing contracts or contingent commitments.

                                       15

In  February  2006,  the  Company   completed  a  private   placement  of

to interest  expense over the life of the debt commencing in 2006. In connection
with this financing, the Company paid a cash private placement fee of $9,000.

FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

       All of the  Company's  product  candidates  are in the  early  stages  of
research and development,  and will require  additional  research,  development,
clinical  testing,   regulatory  approval,   and  a  commitment  of  significant
additional resources prior to commercialization.  Based on its current operating
plan,  the Company has  sufficient  capital  resources  to meet its  obligations
through the second quarter of 2006. The Company requires  additional  funding in
order to move forward with our research and  development  plan.  The Company has
reasonable assumptions that additional debt or equity financing may be available
under its Placement Agency  Agreement with Indigo Ventures,  LLC, however it can
provide no assurance  that such funding will be obtained.  The Company's  future
capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the following:

       -  Continued  scientific  progress in its  research,  drug  discovery and
          development plans

       -  Size of its program and progress with clinical trials

       -  Time and costs associated with regulatory approvals

       -  Recruitment of key management

REGULATORY APPROVAL

       The Company must conduct  time-consuming  and costly  clinical  trials to
show  safety and  efficacy in each of its  product  candidates  before a product
candidate  may be  approved  for  distribution.  The  clinical  trials  must  be
conducted in accordance with the FDA  regulations.  If the FDA believes that the
Company has not  sufficiently  demonstrated  safety and  efficacy in its product
candidates,  it will not  approve  them,  or will  require  additional  clinical
studies,  which will require additional time and resources.  The Company may not
be able to obtain the necessary  regulatory  approval on a timely  basis,  if at
all, for any of its product  candidates.  Failure to receive these  approvals or
delays in the approvals may prevent or delay commercialization of a product, and
as a result,  could negatively impact the Company's ability to generate revenue.
The Company can give no assurances  that any of its product  candidates  will be
safe and effective, will be approved for  commercialization,  or that it will be
successful in the commercialization of these products.

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

       The  Company  does  not  invest  in or  own  any  market  risk  sensitive
instruments entered into for trading purposes or for purposes other than trading
purposes.  All loans to the Company  have been made with fixed  interest  rates,
and, accordingly,  the market risk to the Company prior to the maturity of those
instruments is minimal.

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

       The Company's  management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e)  under the Exchange  Act) that is designed to ensure that  information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,  summarized and reported,
within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  Commission's  rules  and  forms.
Disclosure  controls and procedures include,  without  limitation,  controls and
procedures  designed to ensure that  information  required to be disclosed by an
issuer  in the  reports  that it files or  submits  under  the  Exchange  Act is
accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal
executive officer or officers and principal  financial  officer or officers,  or
persons performing  similar functions,  as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.

       In accordance  with  Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15,  an evaluation
was completed under the supervision and with the  participation of the Company's
management,  including  the Company's  President,  Chief  Financial  Officer and
Secretary,  of the  effectiveness  of the design and  operation of the Company's
disclosure  controls and  procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
Annual Report. Based on that evaluation,  the Company's management including the
President,  Chief Financial Officer and Secretary,  concluded that the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance
that  information  required to be disclosed in the  Company's  reports  filed or
submitted  under  the  Exchange  Act is  recorded,  processed,  summarized,  and
reported within the time periods specified in the Commission's  rules and forms.

       InCon Technologies,  Inc., a wholly-owned  subsidiary of the Company, and
Asia Pacific Investment Holdings Limited (collectively,  the "Sellers"), entered
into a Purchase and Sale Agreement,  dated as of October 31, 2005 (the "Purchase
Agreement"), pursuant to which the Sellers agreed to sell their respective fifty
percent (50%) ownership interests in InCon Processing,  LLC ("InCon"),  to InCon
International,  Inc.  in  exchange  for  all of the  membership  units  of  Bali
Holdings,  LLC ("Bali")  which are owned by N.P.  Shaikh  ("Shaikh") and John R.
Palmer  ("Palmer").  The sale was made  upon the  Company's  determination  that
InCon's  operations,  which includes high vacuum  distillation,  production toll
work and process development, would no longer comprise a material element in the
Company's business strategy.

       Pursuant to the  Purchase  Agreement,  the Sellers have agreed to provide
consulting  services to InCon for a term of three (3) years in consideration for
an  annual  consulting  fee in the  amount of the  lesser  of:  (a) One  Hundred
Thousand  Dollars  ($100,000.00)  and (b)  twenty-five  percent (25%) of InCon's
annual earnings before interest,  taxes,  depreciation and amortization over the
five (5) years  beginning  on October  31,  2005  ("Consulting  Fee");  provided
however,  that the total  payments  to each of the  Sellers  in  respect  of the
Consulting Fee shall not exceed Three Hundred  Thousand  Dollars  ($300,000.00).
The Consulting Fee is subject to certain acceleration  provisions as provided in
the Purchase Agreement.

                                       19

As a condition to the Closing of the sale of InCon membership  interests,
InCon is obligated to complete the development of certain tocotrienol processing
technology  (the  "Technology")  and to convey  the sole  right,  ownership  and
interest  in the  Technology  to the  Sellers  who  shall  thereafter  have  the
exclusive  right  to  patent,  license  or  sell  the  Technology  in  its  sole
discretion. While management believes that InCon will deliver the technology, no
assurance  can be given that the  technology  will be  received or that the sale
will be consummated.

       (a)    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such

              affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
              registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.     The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based
       on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial

       functions):

       (a)    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design

       (b)    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
