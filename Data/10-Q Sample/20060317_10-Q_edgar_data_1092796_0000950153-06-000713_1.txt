NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

For the Three and Nine Months Ended January 31, 2006 and
2005 

(1)  
     
     Basis of Presentation:  

The consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2006, the
consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine
months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, the consolidated
statement of changes in stockholders  equity for the nine
months ended January 31, 2006, and the consolidated
statements of cash flows for the nine months ended
January 31, 2006 and 2005 have been prepared by us, without
audit. The quarter end for our wholly owned subsidiary,
Smith & Wesson Corp., was January 29, 2006, a
two-day variance to our reported fiscal quarter end of
January 31, 2006. This variance did not create any material
difference in the financial statements as presented. In our
opinion, all adjustments, which include only normal recurring
adjustments necessary to fairly present the financial position,
results of operations, changes in stockholders  equity, and
cash flows at January 31, 2006 and for the periods
presented have been included. All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated. The balance sheet as of
April 30, 2005 has been derived from our audited financial
statements.

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included
in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States have been
condensed or omitted. These consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and
notes thereto included in our company s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2005. The
results of operations for the nine months ended January 31,
2006 may not be indicative of the results that may be expected
for the year ended April 30, 2006 or any other period.

     Organization:  

Organization   

We were incorporated on June 17, 1991 in the state of
Nevada.

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Smith & Wesson Corp., was
incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on
January 13, 1987. Smith & Wesson Corp. and its
predecessors have been in business since 1852. Since its
formation, Smith & Wesson Corp. has undergone several
ownership changes. On June 9, 1987, Tomkins Corporation
( Tomkins ), a company organized under the laws of the
state of Delaware that is a subsidiary of U.K.-based Tomkins
PLC, acquired Smith & Wesson Corp. from Lear Siegler.

On May 11, 2001, we purchased all of the outstanding stock
of Smith & Wesson Corp. from Tomkins for $15,000,000.
At a special meeting of stockholders held on February 14,
2002, our stockholders approved a change of our company s
name to Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation.

(3)  
     
     Acquisition of Smith & Wesson Corp.:  

The Acquisition   

Pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of May 11,
2001 between Tomkins and us, we acquired all of the issued and
outstanding stock of Smith & Wesson Corp. As a result
of the acquisition, Smith & Wesson Corp. became our
wholly owned subsidiary. We paid $15,000,000 in exchange for all
of the issued and outstanding shares of Smith & Wesson
Corp. as follows:

$5 million, which was paid at closing in cash. 

$10 million due on or before May 11, 2002 pursuant to
    the terms of an unsecured promissory note issued by us to
    Tomkins providing for interest at a rate of 9% per year.
    During March 2002, we obtained a bank loan and paid off the
    entire loan balance.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

In January 2005, we completed the refinancing of our existing
debt utilizing our receivables, inventory, and property, plant,
and equipment as collateral. The financing was obtained through
TD BankNorth, with which we had previous loans. As a result of
our refinancing, we were able to repay the Tomkins Note, which
had an interest rate of 9% per year and restrictive
covenants, along with the previously existing loans with TD
BankNorth. We used the cash that was collateral for our existing
line of credit with TD BankNorth toward the repayment of the
Tomkins Note.

The new credit facility consists of the following:

(1) A revolving line of credit in an amount up to a maximum
amount of the lesser of (a) $17 million; or
(b) (i) 85% of the net amount of our eligible
receivables as defined; (ii) plus the lesser of
$6 million or 70% of eligible raw materials inventory; plus
(iii) 60% of eligible finished goods inventory; and
(iv) plus 40% of eligible finished parts inventory. The
revolving line of credit bears interest at a variable rate equal
to prime or LIBOR plus 250 basis points (with the
250 basis point LIBOR spread being reduced if we meet
certain targets with respect to our maximum leverage). The
amount available under this line of credit is reduced by any
outstanding letters of credit, an ACH holdback of $420,000, and
15% of any outstanding forward hedging contracts. There was
$2.5 million outstanding under this line of credit as of
January 31, 2006 bearing interest at a rate of
7.50% per annum.

(2) A seven-year, $10.7 million term loan bearing
interest at a rate of 6.23% per annum. The monthly payment
is $178,671, with the final payment due on January 11, 2012.

(3) A ten-year, $5.8 million term loan bearing
interest at a rate of 6.85% per annum. The monthly payment
is $45,525 through December 11, 2014 with a balloon payment
due on January 11, 2015 of $3,975,611.

(4) A $5 million credit arrangement for capital
expenditures, which will bear interest at a variable rate until
April 30, 2006 equal to either prime or LIBOR plus
250 basis points (with the 250 basis point LIBOR
spread being reduced if we meet certain targets with respect to
our maximum leverage), and then either a variable rate equal to
LIBOR plus 250 basis points (with the 250 basis point
LIBOR spread being reduced if we meet certain targets with
respect to our maximum leverage), or a fixed rate equal to the
Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston Rate as of April 30,
2006 plus 200 basis points, in each case with the
applicable rate selected by us. The aggregate availability of
this facility will cease on April 30, 2006, at which time
any unpaid outstanding principal balance and interest will
become due and payable in monthly installments over a period of
seven years. There were no amounts outstanding as of
January 31, 2006.

We are in full compliance with all bank covenants as of
January 31, 2006.

     Inventory:  

The composition of our inventories, stated at lower of first in,
first out cost or market, is as follows:

(6)  
     
     Advertising Costs:  

We expense advertising costs, primarily consisting of magazine
advertisements and printed materials, as incurred. For the nine
months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, advertising expense
was approximately $5,337,000 and $4,150,000, respectively.

(7)  
     
     Warranty Reserve:  

We generally provide a lifetime warranty to the original
purchaser of our firearms products. We provide for estimated
warranty obligations in the period in which we recognize the
related revenue. We quantify and record an estimate for
warranty-related costs based on our actual historical claims
experience and current repair costs. We make adjustments to
accruals as warranty claims data and historical experience
warrant. Should we experience actual claims and repair costs
that are higher than the estimated claims and repair costs used
to calculate the provision, our operating results for the period
or periods in which such returns or additional costs materialize
would be adversely impacted. Warranty expense for the nine
months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 was $748,516 and
$1,013,204, respectively.

The change in accrued warranties for the nine months ended
January 31, 2006 and the fiscal year ended April 30,
2005 was as follows:

(8)  
     
     Self-Insurance Reserves:  

As of January 31, 2006 and April 30, 2005, we had
reserves for workers  compensation, product liability, and
medical/dental costs totaling $9,684,696 and $10,658,339,
respectively, of which $5,684,792 and $6,723,647, respectively,
have been classified as non-current and included in other
non-current liabilities, and the remaining amounts of $3,999,904
and $3,934,692, respectively, have been included in current
liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
While we believe these reserves to be adequate, there exists a
possibility that the ultimate liabilities will exceed such
estimates. Amounts charged to expense were $1,113,288 and
$1,581,028 for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

It is our policy to provide an estimate for loss as a result of
expected adverse findings or legal settlements when we believe
such losses are probable and are reasonably estimable. It is
also our policy to accrue for reasonable estimable legal costs
associated with defending such litigation. While such estimates
involve a range of possible costs, we determine, in consultation
with litigation counsel, the most likely cost within such range
on a case-by-case basis. At January 31, 2006 and
April 30, 2005, we had product liability reserves of
approximately $7.5 million and $8.0 million,
respectively, consisting entirely of estimated legal defense
costs. In addition, we had recorded receivables from insurance
carriers related to these liabilities of approximately
$5.2 million, of which approximately $4.0 million has
been classified as other assets and the remaining
$1.2 million has been classified as other current assets.

(9)  
     
     Commitments and Contingencies:  

Litigation   

We, together with other firearms manufacturers and certain
related organizations, are a co-defendant in various legal
proceedings involving product liability claims and are aware of
other product liability claims, including allegations of
defective product design, manufacturing, negligent marketing,
and/or distribution of firearms leading to personal injury,
including wrongful death. The lawsuits and claims are based
principally on the theory of  strict liability,  but
also may be based on negligence, breach of warranty, and other
legal theories. In many of the lawsuits, punitive damages, as
well as compensatory damages, are demanded. Aggregate claimed
amounts currently exceed product liability accruals and, if
applicable, insurance coverage. We believe that, in every case,
the various allegations as described above are unfounded, and,
in addition, that any accident and any results from them were
due to negligence or misuse of the firearm by the claimant or a
third party and that there should be no recovery against us.

In addition, we are a co-defendant in various legal proceedings
brought by certain cities, municipalities, and counties against
numerous firearms manufacturers, distributors, and dealers
seeking to recover damages allegedly arising out of the misuse
of firearms by third parties in shootings. The complaints by
municipalities seek damages, among other things, for the costs
of medical care, police and emergency services, public health
services, and the maintenance of courts, prisons, and other
services. In certain instances, the plaintiffs seek to recover
for decreases in property values and loss of business within the
city due to increased criminal violence. In addition, nuisance
abatement and/or injunctive relief is sought to change the
design, manufacture, marketing, and distribution practices of
the various defendants. These suits allege, among other claims,
strict liability or negligence in the design of products, public
nuisance, negligent entrustment, negligent distribution,
deceptive or fraudulent advertising, violation of consumer
protection statutes, and conspiracy or concert of action
theories. We believe that, in every case, the various
allegations as described above are unfounded, and, in addition,
that any accident and any results from them were due to
negligence or misuse of the firearm by a third party and that
there should be no recovery against us.

We monitor the status of known claims and the product liability
accrual, which includes amounts for defense costs for asserted
and unasserted claims. While it is difficult to forecast the
outcome of these claims, we believe, after consultation with
litigation counsel, that it is uncertain whether the outcome of
these claims will have a material adverse effect on our
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We
believe that we have provided adequate reserves for defense
costs. We do not anticipate material adverse judgments and
intend to vigorously defend ourselves.

At this time, an estimated range of reasonably possible
additional losses, as that term is defined in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5,
 Loss Contingencies,  relating to unfavorable outcomes
cannot be made. However, in the product liability cases in which
a dollar amount of damages is claimed, the amount of damages
claimed, which totaled approximately $583,000 at
January 31, 2006, is set forth as an indication of possible
maximum liability that we might be required to incur in these
cases

STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

(regardless of the likelihood or reasonable probability of any
or all of this amount being awarded to claimants) as a result of
adverse judgments that are sustained on appeal.

In the quarter ended January 31, 2006, defense costs of
$125,000 were incurred and were paid directly by our insurance
carriers. Consequently we have reduced our product liability and
municipal litigation reserves and our receivable from insurers
by $125,000.

We have recorded the liability for defense costs at a level
before reimbursement from insurance carriers. We have also
recorded the amount due as reimbursement under existing policies
from the insurance carriers as a receivable shown in other
current assets and other assets.

On October 26, 2005, President George W. Bush signed into
law the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. The
legislation is designed to prohibit civil liability actions from
being brought or continued against manufacturers, distributors,
dealers, or importers of firearms or ammunition for damages,
injunctions, or other relief resulting from the misuse of their
products by others. The legislation, by its terms, would result
in the dismissal of the various cases against us and preclude
similar cases in the future. The legislation does not preclude
traditional product liability actions. There have been
constitutional and other challenges to the legislation in some
of the pending cases. We cannot predict whether judges in
existing proceedings will dismiss cases currently pending before
them. No adjustments to municipal litigation reserves have been
made as a result of the passage of this law.

Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )
    Investigation   

The SEC is conducting an investigation to determine whether
there have been violations of the federal securities laws in
connection with matters relating to the restatement of our
consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2002 and the first
three quarters of fiscal 2003. We continue to be in discussions
with the SEC and intend to continue to cooperate fully with the
SEC. There has been no change in the status of this
investigation during the quarter ended January 31, 2006.

Environmental Remediation   

We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws that
regulate the discharge of materials into, or otherwise relate to
the protection of, the environment. These laws have required,
and are expected to continue to require, us to make significant
expenditures of both a capital and expense nature. Several of
the more significant federal laws applicable to our operations
include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act ( CERCLA ) and the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as
amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

We have programs and personnel monitor compliance with various
federal, state, and local environmental regulations. In the
normal course of our manufacturing operations, we are subject to
occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to
waste disposal, air emissions, and water discharges into the
environment. We fund our environmental costs through cash flows
from operating revenue and expect to do so in the future. We
believe that we are in compliance with applicable environmental
regulations in all material respects.

We are required to remediate hazardous waste at our facilities.
Currently, we own designated sites in Springfield, Massachusetts
and are subject to five release areas that are the focus of
remediation projects as part of the Massachusetts Contingency
Plan, or MCP. Three of these sites are contained on property
sold to the Springfield Redevelopment Authority or SRA. The MCP
provides a structured environment for the voluntary remediation
of regulated releases. We may be required to remove hazardous
waste or remediate the alleged effects of hazardous substances
on the environment associated with past disposal practices at
sites not owned by us. We have received notice that we are a
potentially responsible party from the Environmental Protection
Agency, or EPA, and/or individual states under CERCLA or a state
equivalent at one site.

SMITH & WESSON HOLDING CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES 

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

As of January 31, 2006, we had reserves of approximately
$632,800 ($577,600 as non-current) for remediation of the
remaining sites. The time frame for payment of such remediation
for the remaining sites is currently indeterminable thus
precluding any present value calculation. Our estimates of these
costs are based upon presently enacted laws and regulations,
currently available facts, experience in remediation efforts,
existing technology, and the ability of other potentially
responsible parties or contractually liable parties to pay the
allocated portions of any environmental obligations. When the
available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of
liability, that estimate has been used; when the information is
only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and
no point within the range is more likely than any other, the
lower end of the range has been used. We do not have insurance
coverage for our environmental remediation costs. We have not
recognized any gains from probable recoveries or other gain
contingencies. The environmental reserve was calculated using
undiscounted amounts based on independent environmental
remediation reports obtained.

On February 25, 2003, we sold approximately 85 acres
of company-owned property in the city of Springfield,
Massachusetts to the SRA for $1.75 million, resulting in a
net gain of $1.7 million. The terms of the sale included a
cash payment of $750,000 at the closing and a promissory note
for the remaining $1.0 million. The note is collateralized
by a mortgage on the sold property. This note is due in 2022 and
accrues interest at a fixed rate of 6.0% per annum.

This property is excess land adjacent to our manufacturing and
office facility. The 85 acres includes three of our five
previously disclosed release areas that have identified soil and
groundwater contamination under the MCP, specifically the South
Field, West Field, and Fire Pond. This property was acquired by
SRA as a defined  Brownfield  under the CERCLA. We
believe that the SRA plans to create a light industrial and
other commercial use development park on the property. SRA, with
the support of the city of Springfield, has received
governmental  Brownfield  grants or loans to
facilitate the remediation and development of the property. The
remediation of the property was completed during the quarter
ended July 31, 2005. Consequently, we have released the
reserve related to the property. This adjustment totaled
approximately $3.1 million and is included as a credit to
environmental expense within operating expenses for the nine
months ended January 31, 2006. Based upon previously
identified specific facts and circumstances, we may revise the
environmental reserve in the future. Any revision could have a
significant impact on us in the period in which an adjustment is
made.

Based on information known to us, we do not expect current
environmental regulations or environmental proceedings and
claims to have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, it is
not possible to predict with certainty the impact on us of
future environmental compliance requirements or of the cost of
resolution of future environmental proceedings and claims, in
part because the scope of the remedies that may be required is
not certain, liability under federal environmental laws is joint
and several in nature, and environmental laws and regulations
are subject to modification and changes in interpretation. There
can be no assurance that additional or changing environmental
regulation will not become more burdensome in the future and
that any such development would not have a material adverse
effect on us.

Contracts   

Employment Agreements   We have entered into
employment agreements with certain officers and managers to
retain their services in the ordinary course of business.

Other Agreements   We have distribution agreements
with third parties in the ordinary course of business.

as the effect would be anti-dilutive.

Stock Warrants   

In fiscal 2002, we issued warrants related to the financing of
debt used for the acquisition of Smith & Wesson Corp.,
as incentive bonuses to employees and directors, and as
compensation to outside consultants.

In consideration for past services to our company, including
services rendered in connection with the acquisition of
Smith & Wesson Corp., we issued a common stock purchase
warrant, dated May 11, 2001 to Mitchell Saltz, formerly
Chief Executive Officer and currently a director of our company
(the  Saltz Warrant ). The Saltz Warrant, which
contained a cashless exercise provision, entitled Mr. Saltz
to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock at an
exercise price of $0.89 per share, subject to adjustment as
set forth therein, at any time from the date of issuance until
five years from the date of issuance.

In consideration for past services to our company, including
services rendered in connection with the acquisition of
Smith & Wesson Corp., we issued a common stock purchase
warrant, dated May 11, 2001 to Robert L. Scott, a former
officer and current director of our company (the  Scott
Warrant ). The Scott Warrant, which contained a cashless
exercise provision, entitled Mr. Scott to purchase up to
5,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of
$0.89 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth
therein, at any time from the date of issuance until five years
from the date of issuance.

During the year ended April 30, 2005, Mr Scott exercised
311,250 warrants on a cashless basis resulting in 200,000 common
shares issued. As a result, at year end 2005, the unexercised
Salz and Scott warrants were 9,688,750 as shown in the table
below. Subsequently, in May 2005, Mr. Scott determined to
exercise these warrants on a gross basis and paid the $0.89 cash
exercise price for the 200,000 shares received. As a
result, Mr. Scott exercised 200,000 warrants on a gross
exercise basis rather than 311,250 warrants on a cashless
exercise basis. As a result, we reinstated 111,250 warrants as
unexercised warrants in May 2005.

During May 2005, we amended the Saltz and Scott warrants to
eliminate the cashless exercise feature, which permitted the
warrants to be net share settled. The effect of this
modification was determined not to cause incremental
compensation cost.

During the nine months ended January 31, 2006,
Mr. Saltz exercised warrants to
purchase 500,000 shares and Mr. Scott exercised
warrants to purchase 329,700 shares on a gross basis
resulting in 8,970,300 unexercised warrants at
September 12, 2005.

On September 12, 2005, we entered into an agreement under
which Messrs. Saltz and Scott tendered their unexercised
warrants to purchase 8,970,300 shares to us in
exchange for a cash payment of $2.67 per share. The
purchase of these warrants on September 12, 2005 did not
result in additional compensation expense.

The Saltz and Scott warrants were initially valued at
$0.89 per share, or $7,983,567. See Note 12.

The following outlines the activity related to these warrants
for the periods indicated:

Employee Stock Option and Employee Stock Purchase
    Plans   

We have two Employee Stock Option Plans ( the SOPs ):
the 2001 Stock Option Plan and the 2004 Incentive Compensation
Plan. New grants were not made under the 2001 Stock Option Plan
following the approval of the 2004 Incentive Compensation Plan
at our 2004 annual meeting of stockholders. All new grants
covering all participants will be issued under the 2004
Incentive Compensation Plan. The 2004 Incentive Compensation
Plan authorizes the issuance of the lesser of (1) 15% of
the shares of our common stock outstanding from time to time or
(2) 10,000,000 shares of our common stock, and such
shares are available for issuance pursuant to options granted to
acquire common stock, the direct granting of restricted common
stock or deferred stock, the granting of stock appreciation
rights, or the granting of dividend equivalents. The Board of
Directors or a committee established by the board administers
the SOPs, selects recipients to whom options are granted, and
determines the number of grants to be awarded. Options granted
under the SOPs are exercisable at a price determined by the
board or committee at the time of grant, but in no event at a
price less than fair market value. Grants of options may be made
to employees and directors without regard to any performance
measures. All options issued pursuant to the SOPs are
nontransferable and subject to forfeiture. Unless terminated
earlier by the Board of Directors, the 2004 Incentive
Compensation Plan will terminate at such time as no shares of
common stock remain available for issuance under the plan and
our company has no further rights or obligations with respect to
outstanding awards under the plan. Unless otherwise specified by
the Board of Directors or board committee in the resolution
authorizing such option, the date of grant of an option is
deemed to be the date upon which the Board of Directors or board
committee authorizes the granting of such option. Generally,
options vest over a period of three years. During the nine
months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, we granted options
to purchase 810,000 shares and 970,000 shares,
respectively. The number

and weighted average exercise prices of options granted under
the SOPs and an employee grant outside the SOPs for the nine
months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:

A summary of stock options outstanding and exercisable at
January 31, 2006 follows:

We also have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( the
ESPP ), which authorizes the sale of up to
10,000,000 shares of our common stock to employees. The
ESPP commenced on June 24, 2002 and continues in effect for
a term of 10 years unless sooner terminated. The ESPP was
implemented by a series of offering periods of two year
duration, with four six-month purchase periods in the offering
period. The plan was amended in September 2004 such that future
offering periods, commencing with the October 1, 2004
offering period, will be six months, consistent with the
six-month purchase period. The purchase price is 85% of the fair
market value of our common stock on the offering date or on the
purchase date, whichever is lower. A participant may elect to
have payroll deductions made on each payday during the offering
period in an amount not less than 1% and not more than 20% (or
such greater percentage as the board may establish from time to
time before an offering date) of such participant s
compensation on each payday during the offering period. The last
day of each offering period will be the purchase date for such
offering period. An offering period commencing on April 1
ends on the next September 30. An offering period
commencing on October 1 ends on the next March 31. The
Board of Directors has the power to change the duration and/or
the frequency of offering and purchase periods with respect to
future offerings and purchases without stockholder approval if
such change is announced at least five days prior to the
scheduled beginning of the first offering period to be affected.
The maximum number of shares an employee may purchase during
each purchase period is 12,500 shares. All options and
rights to participate in the ESPP are nontransferable and
subject to forfeiture in accordance with the ESPP guidelines. In
the event of certain corporate transactions, each option
outstanding under the ESPP will be assumed or an equivalent
option will be substituted by the successor corporation or a
parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation. During the
nine months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, 88,472 and
106,811 shares were purchased under the ESPP, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

During the year ended April 30, 2005, we adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS )
No. 123(R),  Share-Based Payment  which requires
the measurement of the cost of employee services received in
exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the
grant-date fair value of the award. We elected the modified
retrospective application method in adopting SFAS 123(R),
which resulted in the restatement of prior period amounts in
order to present comparable compensation data (Note 12). In
accordance with SFAS 123(R), we have calculated the fair
value of our stock options and warrants issued to employees
using the Black-Scholes model at the time the options and
warrants were granted. That amount is then amortized over the
vesting period of the option or warrant. With our ESPP, fair
value is determined at the beginning of the purchase period and
amortized over the term of the offering period. The following
assumptions were used in valuing our options and ESPP under
SFAS 123(R), granted during the three month periods ended
January 31, 2006 and 2005; there were no warrants granted
to employees during these periods:

The following assumptions were used in valuing our options and
ESPP under SFAS 123(R), granted during the nine month
periods ended January 31, 2006 and 2005; there were no
warrants granted to employees during these periods:

We estimate expected volatility using historical volatility for
the expected term. The fair value of each stock option or ESPP
purchase was estimated on the date of the grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average fair
value of stock options granted during the three months ended
January 31, 2006 and 2005 was $3.73 and $1.24,
respectively. The weighted-average fair value of ESPP shares
granted during the three months ended January 31, 2006 and
2005 was $1.76 and $0.53, respectively. The total stock-based
compensation

expense related to SFAS 123(R) was $662,592 and $206,154
for the three months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively and $1,516,903 and $416,457 for the nine months
ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Stock-based
compensation expense is included in general and administrative
expenses.

On August 1, 2005, we granted an option to
purchase 25,000 shares of our common stock to a
consultant which fully vested six months later on
November 30, 2005. During the three months and nine months
ended January 31, 2006, we recorded the estimated fair
value of this option grant, totaling approximately $118,000, to
general and administrative expenses in the accompanying
statements of operations. We estimated the fair value of the
option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with
the following assumptions: volatility of 75%, risk-free interest
rate of 4.32%, an expected life of 10 years, and a dividend
yield of 0%.

     Private Placement Offering  

On September 12, 2005 we completed the sale of an aggregate
of 6,000,000 shares of our common stock (the
 Shares ) and warrants to purchase an additional
1,200,000 shares of its common stock (the
 Warrants ). The sale was made to institutional
investors in reliance upon the exemption from registration
requirements under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of
1933 and Rule 506 of Regulation D under such Act (the
 Private Placement ). We received gross proceeds of
$26,160,000 cash from the sale of theses Securities. We agreed
to promptly file a registration statement with the Securities
and Exchange Commission to register the Shares and shares of
common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants (the
 Registration Statement ). The Private Placement was
made pursuant to a securities purchase agreement by and among us
and the investors.

The exercise price for the Warrants is $5.33 per share. The
Warrants are exercisable beginning on March 12, 2006 and
expire on the later to occur of (i) the 180th trading
day following the date the Registration Statement is declared
effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and
(ii) the 210th day following the closing date of the
Private Placement. As the Registration Statement was declared
effective on January 10, 2006, the expiration date of the
warrants is September 26, 2006. The number of shares
issuable upon exercise of the Warrants is subject to adjustment
for any stock dividends, stock splits or distributions by us, or
upon any merger or consolidation or sale of assets of ours,
tender or exchange offer for our common stock, or a
reclassification of our common stock.

We incurred issuance costs of $2,962,644, including the issuance
of a warrant to purchase 120,000 shares of our common
stock to the placement agent, having an initial fair value of
$384,000. The exercise price of the placement agent s
warrants is $4.36 per share. The terms of the placement
agent s warrant are substantially the same as the Warrants
sold to the investors except that it becomes exercisable on
March 12, 2006 and expires on September 12, 2010.

The proceeds from the Private Placement were used to repurchase
outstanding common stock warrants held by Mitchell A. Saltz and
Robert L. Scott, who are directors of our company, and for
general working capital. We also entered into an agreement with
Messrs. Saltz, Scott, and Colton R. Melby, another director
of our company, pursuant to which Messrs. Saltz, Scott, and
Melby have agreed to sell to us, at our discretion under certain
circumstances, an aggregate of 1,200,000 shares of our
common stock, if requested by us, at a price per share of $5.33,
which is equivalent to the exercise price of the warrants.

Under the terms of the securities purchase agreement among us
and the investors in the Private Placement, we are required to
pay penalties if we fail to meet our obligations to register the
Shares and shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants.
Specifically, if any of the following events (each an
 Event ) occurs, we will be required to pay cash as
partial liquidated damages to the Private Placement investors:
(i) if we fail to file a registration statement registering
the Shares and shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant or
such registration statement is not declared effective on or
prior to the dates specified in the securities purchase

agreement; (ii) if, with certain exceptions, an investor is
not permitted sell registered securities under the registration
statement for any reason for five or more trading days in any
calendar quarter; (iii) if, with certain exceptions, our
common stock is not listed or quoted, or is suspended from
trading, on an eligible market for a period of three trading
days in any calendar quarter; (iv) if we fail to deliver a
certificate evidencing any securities to an investor within
three days after delivery of such certificate is required or the
exercise rights of the investor pursuant to the Warrants are
otherwise suspended for any reason; or (v) we fail to have
available a sufficient number of authorized but unissued and
otherwise unreserved shares of our common stock available to
issue shares upon any exercise of the Warrants. As a result of
these registration rights and in accordance with Emerging Issues
Task Force ( EITF ) Issue No. 00-19,
 Accounting for Derivative Financial Stock,  we
recorded the initial fair value of the Warrants and the
placement agent s warrants at the date of issuance,
totaling $1,188,000, as a financial instrument liability,
$804,000 and $384,000, respectively. Also in accordance with
EITF 00-19, subsequent changes in fair value are being
recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as general
and administrative expenses. The total fair value of the
warrants was $1,021,200 at January 31, 2006. During the
three and nine months ended January 31, 2006, the related
decrease in fair value of the warrants totaling $285,600 and
$166,800, respectively, was recorded as a credit to general and
administrative expenses.

The following assumptions were used in determining the fair
value of the outstanding warrants issued to investors and the
placement agent in connection with the Private Placement as of
January 31, 2006:

We have classified the net residual proceeds from the offering,
which have been allocated to common stock, totaling $23,197,357,
as temporary equity in accordance with EITF Topic D-98,
 Classification and Measurement of Redeemable
Securities.  This classification is the result of the
registration rights within the securities purchase agreement,
which may require us to pay cash penalties to the Private
Placement investors, if certain conditions are not met and
maintained, which remain outside of our control.

     Restatement to Correct Accounting for Certain Stock Awards
    under Accounting Principles Board ( APB ) Opinion
    No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees,  and to Adopt Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 123(R),  Share-Based Payment 
    (Revised 2004):  

In June 2005, we determined that our previously reported
financial statements for 2002, 2003, 2004 and the first three
quarters of fiscal 2005 required restatement to increase
compensation expense for certain employee stock awards. We
issued warrants to two former employees in May 2001, containing
a cashless exercise feature, and as a result compensation
expense should have been adjusted in subsequent periods through
April 30, 2005 for increases or decreases in the quoted
value of our stock. In addition, in fiscal 2004 and 2005, we
should have recorded compensation expense resulting from the
modification of certain vested stock options for terminating
employees. For the year ended April 30, 2005, we decided to
early adopt SFAS 123(R),  Share-Based Payment, 
(Revised 2004), (SFAS 123(R)), using the modified
retrospective application method. We filed a report on
Form 8-K on July 1, 2005 describing the need to
restate our previously issued financial statements to correct
compensation expense and our decision to adopt FAS 123(R).
The financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for the
three and nine months ended January 31, 2005 have been
restated to correct compensation expense and to adopt
SFAS 123(R).

Overview 

Please refer to the Overview found in the Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended April 30, 2005. This Overview sets forth key
management objectives and key performance indicators used by
management as well as key industry data tracked by management.

Third Quarter Fiscal 2006 Highlights 

Net product sales for the three months ended January 31,
2006 was $38.6 million, a $7.5 million, or 24.0%,
increase over net product sales of $31.1 million for the
three months ended January 31, 2005. Firearms sales, our
core business, increased for the quarter by $7.4 million,
or 25.9%, compared with the three months ended January 31,
2005.

Net income for the three months ended January 31, 2006 was
$1.1 million compared with a loss of $153,112 for the three
months ended January 31, 2005.

During the quarter, we introduced and began shipment of our
M&P pistol series. Sales during the quarter were primarily
to the sporting goods trade channel. We have shipped samples to
over 150 police departments for testing and evaluation. Sales in
the third quarter were of the .40 caliber version of the pistol.
We will ship a 9mm version, which is the preferred caliber in
the international market, during the fourth quarter of this year.

We also introduced and began shipments of our M&P15 tactical
rifle. The domestic rifle and shotgun ( long guns )
market is $1.0 billion compared with the handgun market,
which is approximately $600 million. The tactical rifle
market is approximately a $130 million domestic market, but
it is the fastest growing segment in the long gun market. We
have conducted extensive research on the strength of the
Smith & Wesson brand and have found that the brand has
strong appeal in the long gun market. It is also a natural
progression for us because our sales force services the same
customer base. There is also a growing demand for tactical
rifles in law enforcement as many agencies are replacing the
pump shotguns that have been traditionally carried in police
vehicle with a tactical rifle.

During the second quarter, we completed the transition of our
domestic sporting goods sales force from one that was a mixture
of employees and manufacturer representatives to one that was
solely made up of our employees. Our intention was to provide
better coverage at point of sale. We have begun to see
significant results from that change, with sporting goods sales
up 24% for the quarter ended January 31, 2006 compared with
the quarter ended January 31, 2005.

Restatement/ SEC Inquiry   

In August 2003, we decided to amend various reports previously
filed with the SEC to modify certain accounting matters related
to our acquisition of Smith & Wesson Corp. We decided
to restate our Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the fiscal
year ended April 30, 2002 as well as our Quarterly Reports
on Form 10-QSB for the quarters ended July 31, 2001
and 2002, October 31, 2001 and 2002, and January 31,
2002 and 2003. The Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the
fiscal year ended April 30, 2003 was filed in December 2003
and included restated financial statements for fiscal 2002. The
amended Quarterly Reports on Form 10-QSB for the July and
October quarters were filed in January 2004, and the amended
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-QSB for the January quarters
were filed in March 2004. The SEC is conducting an informal
inquiry regarding the circumstances surrounding the restatement.
We are cooperating fully with the SEC in this inquiry. The
inquiry is still ongoing.

In June 2005, we determined that our previously reported
financial statements for 2002, 2003, 2004 and the first three
quarters of 2005 required restatement to increase compensation
expense for certain employee stock awards. We issued warrants to
two former employees in May 2001, containing a cashless exercise
feature, and as a result compensation expense should have been
adjusted in subsequent periods through April 30, 2005 for
increases or decreases in the quoted value of our stock. In
addition, in fiscal 2004 and 2005,

 21

Table of Contents   

we should have recorded compensation expense resulting from the
modification of certain vested stock options for terminating
employees. For the year ended April 30, 2005, we decided to
early adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123(R),  Share-Based Payment,  (Revised
2004), (SFAS 123(R)), using the modified retrospective
application method. We filed a report on Form 8-K on
July 1, 2005 describing the need to restate our previously
issued financial statements to correct compensation expense and
our decision to adopt SFAS 123(R). The financial statements
included in this Form 10-Q for the three and nine months
ended January 31, 2005 have been restated to correct
compensation expense and to adopt SFAS 123(R). The effect
of this restatement is described in Note 12 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Results of Operations 

Net Product Sales 

The following table sets forth certain information relative to
net product sales for the three months ended January 31,
2006 and 2005:

We recorded net product sales of $38,635,764 for the three
months ended January 31, 2006, an increase of $7,490,243,
or 24.0%, over the three months ended January 31, 2005.
Firearms sales increased by $7,409,442, or 25.9%, over the
comparable quarter last year. Non-firearm sales for the three
months ended January 31, 2006 increased by $80,801, or
3.1%, compared with the three months ended January 31, 2005
due to higher handcuff sales, partially offset by lower
specialty services sales.

Revolver sales increased by $2,682,097, or 20.3%, for the three
months ended January 31, 2006 to $15,924,265, compared with
the three months ended January 31, 2005. The increase
resulted from a 24.3% increase in units sold, primarily in the
sporting and international trade channels. The revolver order
backlog was at $4,773,881 at January 31, 2006.

Pistol sales of $11,645,134 were $4,423,015 or 61.2% higher, for
the three months ended January 31, 2006, than for the three
months ended January 31, 2005. The increase in pistol sales
was attributable to the introduction of the M&P pistol as
well as the government contract for 5,500 Sigma pistols for the
Afghanistan National Police. The pistol order backlog was at
$5,931,184 at January 31, 2006. In February 2006, we
received a $15.0 million contract from the
U.S. government for 51,000 pistols and accessories for the
Afghanistan National Police. The bulk of this order will ship in
fiscal 2007.

We are the exclusive U.S. distributor of Walther firearms.
Walther firearms sales decreased by $1,558,812, or 31.8%, for
the three months ended January 31, 2006 compared with the
three months ended

 22

Table of Contents   

January 31, 2005. The decrease in Walther sales was
attributable to lower demand for the P99 pistol and G22 rifle.
Walther order backlog was at $2,183,473 at January 31, 2006.

Performance Center sales increased by $685,833, or 37.6%, for
the three months ended January 31, 2006 to $2,508,385,
compared with the three months ended January 31, 2005.
Custom variations of the Model 460 were responsible for the
increase in sales. The Performance Center had an order backlog
of $1,557,874 at January 31, 2006.

Engraving sales increased by $756,283, or 157.2%, for the three
months ended January 31, 2006 as compared with the three
months ended January 31, 2005. This increase resulted from
our increased emphasis on the marketing of the engraving
services.

We began shipments of our M&P 15 tactical rifle in January
2006. The product was formally introduced at the SHOT Show in
Las Vegas in February. Shipments during the quarter were to our
sporting goods distribution channel. We have received requests
from approximately 80 law enforcement agencies for test and
evaluation.

Sales through our sporting goods distribution channel increased
by over 24% for the three months ended January 31, 2006
compared with the three months ended January 31, 2005.
International sales increased by over 48% for the three months
ended January 31, 2006 compared with the three months ended
January 31, 2005. Federal government sales accounted for
$1.3 million in sales for the three months ended
January 31, 2006 compared with zero for the quarter ended
January 31, 2005. Law enforcement sales declined by 23% for
the three months ended January 31, 2006. The focus of many
law enforcement agencies is on the M&P pistol. Over 150
agencies have requested samples for test and evaluation. Most of
these evaluations were still in process as of January 31,
2006.

The following table sets forth certain information relative to
net product sales for the nine months ended January 31,

Table of Contents   

14.2% for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 as
compared with nine months ended January 31, 2005, with the
bulk of the sales increase attributable to the introduction of
the Model 460 revolver.

decrease in sales.

Engraving sales increased by $2,489,978, or 302.9%, for the nine
months ended January 31, 2006 compared with the comparable
period last year. This increase was a result of our increase
emphasis on the marketing of the engraving services.

Non-firearms sales declined by $145,929, or 1.9%, for the nine
months ended January 31, 2006 as a result of lower
Specialty Services revenue. Handcuff sales increased by

Table of Contents   

The following table sets forth certain information regarding net
income and the related per share data for the nine months ended
January 31, 2006 and 2005:

The increase in net income and net income per share for the nine
months ended January 31, 2006 compared with the comparable
period ended January 31, 2005 was primarily attributable to
the higher sales volume. The $18.4 million increase in net
sales in the nine months ended January 31, 2006 contributed
an additional $1.6 million in pre-tax income. In addition
we recognized into income a $3.1 million reduction in the
environmental reserves in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
These gains were partially offset by the $4.1 million
insurance settlement in October 2004, as well as the $450,515
gain in 2004 on the sale of our Identi-Kit business. Higher
manufacturing depreciation expense and utilities expense reduced
pre-tax income by $1.6 million, and operating expenses were
$1.7 million higher for the nine months ended
January 31, 2006.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our principal cash requirements are to finance the growth of our
firearms and licensing operations and to service our existing
debt. Capital expenditures for new products, capacity expansion,
and process improvements represent important cash needs.

The following table sets forth certain information relative to
cash flow for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 and
2005:

Operating activities represent the principal source of our cash
flow. The $1,025,443 increase in cash from operating activities
for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 was primarily a
result of the higher net income. The accounts receivable balance
at January 31, 2006 was $19.2 million compared with
$19.9 million at January 31, 2005. Inventory during
the quarter ended January 31, 2006 decreased by
approximately $2.1 million. Inventory for the nine months
ended January 31, 2006 increased by $1.7 million
compared with $1.4 million for the nine months ended
January 31, 2005.

Cash used for investing activities decreased by
$25.9 million for the nine months ended January 31,
2006 compared with the nine months ended January 31, 2005.
Capital spending for the nine months ended January 31, 2006
was $8.8 million compared with $7.4 million for the
nine months ended January 31, 2005. We expect to spend
approximately $16.0 million on capital expenditures in
fiscal 2006. The major capital expenditures will focus on
increasing pistol production capacity to meet increased demand,
expanding our pistol product line, and various projects designed
to increase throughput and upgrade manufacturing technology. We
anticipate spending $8 million to $10 million in
capital expenditures in fiscal 2007. Investing activity for the
nine months ended January 31, 2005 included $300,000 in
proceeds from the sale of our
 Identi-Kit  product line
and $1.5 million from the sale of marketable securities.
The reduction in collateralized deposits of $22.7 million
for the nine months ended January 31, 2005 reflects the
refinancing efforts undertaken in January 2005.

29

Table of Contents   

The $26.4 million increase in cash provided by financing
activities resulted from the $27 million repayment of the
Tomkins Note in January 2005. Short-term bank borrowings totaled
$2.5 million, and we paid $1,176,702 against the long-term
notes payable to BankNorth, our primary bank during the nine
months ended January 31, 2006.

As of January 31, 2006, we had $955,405 in cash and cash
equivalents on hand. We have a $22.0 million credit
facility with BankNorth to support letters of credit, working
capital needs, and capital expenditures. We believe that the
existing credit facility is adequate for our current needs.

Other Matters 

Critical Accounting Policies   

The preparation of financial statements requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Significant accounting policies are disclosed
in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended April 30, 2005. The most significant areas involving
our judgments and estimates are described in the
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Conditions and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2005, to which
there have been no material changes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

We account for warrants issued to investors as part of the
Private Placement in accordance with the provisions of the
Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) Issue
No. 00-19,  Accounting for Derivative Financial
Stock.  Under EITF No. 00-19, the amount of the
liability (Note 11) is calculated on the date of the grant
using the Black-Scholes model. The liability is mark-to-market
adjusted to fair value at the end of each quarter and the change
in the fair value of the liability is recorded to general and
administrative expenses. We are utilizing the Black-Scholes
model to value these warrants, which includes a number of
estimates and assumptions, including stock price volatility
factors. We based our estimates and assumptions on the best
information available at the time of valuation, however, changes
in these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect
on the valuation of the underlying instruments.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) issued SFAS No. 154,
 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,  which
replaces APB 20,  Accounting Changes,  and
SFAS 3,  Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim
Financial Statements   An Amendment of APB Opinion
No. 28.  SFAS 154 provides guidance on the
accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error
corrections. It establishes retrospective application, or the
latest practicable date, as the required method for reporting a
change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction
of an error. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes
and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2005, and is therefore required to be adopted
by us in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We are currently
evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS 154 will
have on our consolidated results of operations and financial
condition, but do not expect it will have a material impact.

Item 3.  
     
      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk   

We do not enter into any market risk sensitive instruments for
trading purposes. Our principal market risk relates to changes
in the value of the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar. A
portion of our gross revenues during the three and nine months
ended January 31, 2006 ($3.3 million and
$10.6 million, respectively, representing approximately
7.8% and 9.3% of aggregate gross revenues, respectively) came
from the sale of goods that were purchased, wholly or partially
from a European manufacturer, in Euros. Annually, we purchase
approximately $10 million of inventory from a European
supplier. This exposes us to risk from foreign exchange rate
fluctuations. A 10% drop in the value of the U.S. Dollar in
relation to the Euro would, to the extent not covered through
price adjustments, reduce our gross profit on that
$10 million of inventory by approximately

 30

Table of Contents   

$1 million. In an effort to offset our risks from
unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations, we enter into Euro
forward contracts.

Our remaining participating forward contracts at 750,000 Euros
each, open from November 4, 2004 were exhausted on
October 27, 2005. On October 4, 2005 we contracted
twelve participating forwards at 600,000 Euros each, for a total
of 7,200,000 Euros. As of January 31, 2006, there were
5,400,000 Euros remaining on nine participating forward options
due at the first of each month at an average price of 1.25 EUR/
USD. The participating forward is a zero cost strategy that has
a forward sell price for EUR/ USD, which provide full protection
against the depreciation and partial benefit from the
appreciation of the currency pair. During the three and nine
months ending January 31, 2006, we experienced a net loss
of $23,130 and $308,918, respectively, on hedging transactions
that we executed during the period in an effort to limit our
exposure to fluctuations in the Euro/ Dollar exchange rate.
During the three months ended January 31, 2006, we
recognized a loss of $62,162 on the mark to market value of
these participating options.

Item 4.  
     
      Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures. As defined in
Rules  13a-15(e) 
and  15d-15(e)  under the
Securities Exchange Act, disclosure controls and procedures are
controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
include controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we
file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We
formed a disclosure committee in the fall of 2002 that includes
senior financial, operational, and legal personnel charged with
assisting the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer in overseeing the accuracy and timeliness of the
periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act and in evaluating
regularly our disclosure controls and procedures.

Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that, as of January 31,
2006, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a
reasonable assurance level in that they were reasonably designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and
(ii) is accumulated and communicated to management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. There have been no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the most
recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Michael and Billie Sue Pavelka v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp.,
et al. , in the Superior Court for the
State of California, for the County of Los Angeles.
The complaint was filed on October 18, 2005, and served on
our agent for service on January 26, 2006. Plaintiffs are
the parents of Matthew Pavelka, a police officer killed in the
line of duty on November 15, 2003. The complaint alleges
the firearms used in the shooting included a Smith &
Wesson firearm, and firearms of two other manufacturers. The
complaint seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages
against the manufacturers, a dealer, an alleged straw purchaser
of one of the firearms not manufactured by us, a shooter, the
estate of a second shooter, and numerous unnamed defendants.
With respect to the manufacturer defendants, plaintiffs assert
claims for negligence, negligent entrustment and public
nuisance. In addition to the claim for compensatory and punitive
damages, the public nuisance count seeks an unspecified form of
injunctive relief. Our motion to dismiss plaintiffs 
complaint is due on March 14, 2006. A hearing on our motion
to dismiss will be scheduled for April 21, 2006.

No other cases of a material nature were filed against us since
the filing of our Quarterly Report on
Form  10-Q  for the
quarter ended October 31, 2005.

The following describes material updates to cases previously
reported by us.

CASES DISMISSED OR RESOLVED  

The following previously reported case has been finally
adjudicated in our favor:

Mayor Michael R. White, and the City of Cleveland v.
Hi-Point Firearms, et al. , in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. On
September 26, 2005, the court entered an order dismissing
the case without prejudice. Plaintiff had until January 23,
2006 to re-file. Plaintiff did not re-file.

CASES ON APPEAL  

The rulings in the following cases are still subject to certain
pending appeals.

City of New York, et al. v. Arms Technology, Inc.,
et al ., in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of New York. The complaint alleges that the
defendants have created, contributed to, and maintained a public
nuisance in the City of New York because of their allegedly
negligent marketing and distribution practices. Plaintiff seeks
injunctive relief. Defendants  Petition for a Writ of
Mandamus requiring the recusal of Judge Weinstein was denied by
the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on May 21, 2004. On
April 8, 2004, the trial court denied plaintiff s
Motion to Strike Defendants  Jury Demands and granted
defendants a Seventh Amendment jury. On April 12, 2004, the
trial court denied defendants  Motion to Dismiss. Our
Answer to the Second Amended Complaint was filed on May 17,
2004. On June 14, 2004, the court entered an order
releasing certain ATF trace data. On June 22, 2004,
defendants filed a Motion to Certify the Court s Order for
Interlocutory Appeal. On July 6, 2004, the court entered an
order denying an immediate separate appeal by defendants. On
July 16, 2004, ATF filed a petition for Writ of Mandamus in
the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, seeking review of Judge
Weinstein s June 14, 2004 order releasing certain
trace data. On August 24, 2004, the Second Circuit issued
an order denying ATF s petition for Writ of Mandamus. On
September 20, 2004, the court entered a protective order
for confidential documents. Depositions of three of our former
employees were held in June of 2005. On October 26, 2005,
defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss based on the Protection of
Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCA). On November 11, 2005,
the Court stayed the November 28, 2005 trial date. On
December 2, 2005, the Court denied defendants  Motion
to Dismiss finding that PLCA is inapplicable to the claims
brought by plaintiff. The Court certified the matter for
interlocutory appeal and continued the stay of the litigation
pending determination by the Second Circuit as to the
applicability of the legislation. On December 13, 2005,
defendants filed their appeal to the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals. On February 8, 2006, the District Court issued a
Rule to Show Cause as to why the case should not be dismissed
based on the language of the 2006 Appropriations Act, which
provides that ATF Trace Data shall not be admissible in civil
proceedings. A hearing was held before the Court on
March 3, 2006, to address whether the Court has authority
to consider the appropriations issue during the pendency of the
Second Circuit Appeal. On March 7, 2006, the Court

32

Table of Contents   

issued an order finding that it retains jurisdiction, and
ordered the parties to submit briefs by April 7, 2006 to
address the applicability and constitutionality of the
Appropriations Act. On March 7, 2006, the Second Circuit
accepted defendants  appeal and issued a scheduling order.
Defendants  brief is due on April 7, 2006.

Tenedora Tuma, S.A. v. Smith & Wesson
Corp ., in the Civil and Commercial Court of the First
District of the Court of First Instance of the National
District, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The plaintiff
commenced this suit by submitting a request for a preliminary
reconciliation hearing. After two preliminary reconciliation
hearings, the Reconciliation Committee issued a Certificate of
Lack of Agreement. Thereafter, a Summons and Notice of Claim was
issued to us on January 17, 2000. The plaintiff alleged we
terminated its distributor agreement without just cause and
sought damages of approximately $20 million Dominican
Republic pesos, or approximately $600,000 U.S. dollars, for
alleged violations of Dominican Republic Law 173 for the
Protection of Importers of Merchandise and Products. Briefing on
the merits was completed in the trial court in November 2002. On
June 7, 2004, the court granted our Motion to Dismiss in
its entirety. Notification of the judgment was filed on
August 10, 2004. On or about September 9, 2004,
plaintiff purportedly appealed the decision. On March 3,
2005, we were informed that a hearing had been held in the Court
of Appeals on October 27, 2004, without notification to our
counsel or us and that the merits of plaintiff s appeal
have been taken under advisement by that court. On June 23,
2005, a hearing was held wherein we attempted to re-open the
appeal based on the lack of service of the appeal papers on us.
On or about November 11, 2005, the Court of Appeals
rendered a final decision. The Court refused plaintiff s
arguments on appeal and upheld our petitions, confirming all
aspects of the Judgment rendered by the Court of First Instance
in our favor. On January 12, 2006, plaintiff appealed to
the Supreme Court in the Dominican Republic. Our response was
filed on February 10, 2006. No hearing has been scheduled
to date.

PENDING CASES  

District of Columbia, et al. v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp.,
et al ., in the Superior Court for the District of
Columbia. The District of Columbia and nine individual
plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of compensatory and
exemplary damages and certain injunctive relief. On
December 16, 2002, the Superior Court for the District of
Columbia granted defendants  motion for judgment on the
pleadings in its entirety. On January 14, 2003, plaintiffs
filed their notice of appeal to the District of Columbia Court
of Appeals. The court of appeals issued its decision, which
affirmed the dismissal of plaintiffs  common law negligence
and public nuisance claims, but reversed the dismissal of the
statutory strict liability count as to the individual
plaintiffs. The court also reversed the dismissal of the
statutory strict liability count as to the District of Columbia
but only to the extent that the District seeks subrogated
damages for named individuals for whom it has incurred medical
expenses. Plaintiffs and defendants each filed separate
petitions for rehearing on May 13, 2004. Oral argument was
held before the D.C. Court of Appeals on January 11, 2005.
On April 21, 2005, the D.C. Court of Appeals issued an
opinion affirming its earlier decision. On July 20, 2005,
defendants filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the United
States Supreme Court. On October 3, 2005, the Supreme Court
denied defendants  Petition for Certiorari. On
October 26, 2005, we filed our Answer to the Third Amended
Complaint. On October 27, 2005, defendants filed a Motion
for Judgment on the Pleadings based on the Protection of Lawful
Commerce in Arms Act. On November 10, 2005, a status
conference was held before Judge Brooke Hedge who set the
briefing schedule for defendants  motion and stayed
discovery pending a decision on defendants  motion.
Plaintiff s opposition to defendants  motion was filed
on December 19, 2005. Defendants  reply was filed on
February 2, 2006. The United States Department of Justice
filed its brief defending the constitutionality of the
Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act on January 30,
2006. Oral argument was held on March 10, 2006. No decision
has issued to date.

City of Gary, Indiana, by its Mayor, Scott L. King v.
Smith & Wesson Corp., et al ., in Lake Superior
Court, Indiana. Plaintiff s complaint alleges public
nuisance, negligent distribution and marketing, and negligent
design and seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory and
punitive damages and certain injunctive relief. Defendants 
motion to dismiss plaintiff s complaint was granted on all
counts on January 11, 2001. On September 20, 2002, the
Indiana Court of Appeals issued an opinion affirming the trial
court s dismissal of plaintiff s claims against the
manufacturer defendants. On December 23, 2003, the Indiana
Supreme Court issued a decision on plaintiff s Petition to
Transfer, reversing the decision of the court of

33

Table of Contents   

appeals and remanding the case to the trial court. The court
held that plaintiff should be allowed to proceed with its public
nuisance and negligence claims against all defendants and its
negligent design claim against the manufacturer defendants. We
filed our answer to plaintiff s amended complaint on
January 30, 2004. Trial has been set for June 15,
2009. On November 23, 2005, defendants filed a Motion to
Dismiss based on the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.
Plaintiffs  opposition to defendants  motion to
dismiss was filed on February 22, 2006. Defendants 
reply is due on April 10, 2006. Oral argument is scheduled
for May 10, 2006.

PROTECTION OF LAWFUL COMMERCE IN ARMS ACT  

On October 26, 2005, President Bush signed the Protection
of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. The legislation is designed to
prohibit civil liability actions from being brought or continued
against manufacturers, distributors, dealers, or importers of
firearms or ammunition for damages, injunctions, or other relief
resulting from the misuse of their products by others. The
legislation by its terms would result in the dismissal against
us and preclude similar cases in the future. The legislation
does not preclude traditional product liability actions. There
have been constitutional and other challenges to the legislation
in some of the pending cases. We cannot predict whether judges
in existing proceedings will dismiss cases currently pending
before them.
