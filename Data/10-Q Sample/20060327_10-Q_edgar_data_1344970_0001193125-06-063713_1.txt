  Item 1. Financial Statements       United Community Bancorp (the  Company ) has not yet been organized and will be
formed upon completion of the mutual holding company reorganization of United Community Bank (the  Bank ). After completion of the reorganization, the Company will become the federally chartered mid-tier stock holding company of the Bank
and will own all of the Bank s capital stock. The Company is not currently an operating company and, therefore, the information presented in this report is for the Bank and its subsidiary.

UNITED COMMUNITY BANK AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      BASIS OF PRESENTATION      The accompanying
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring
accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and six-month periods ended December 31, 2005 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. The
June 30, 2005 Balance Sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles.      MUTUAL HOLDING COMPANY REORGANIZATION AND MINORITY STOCK ISSUANCE      On September 22, 2005, and as amended and restated on December 8, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Bank unanimously adopted a Plan of Reorganization and Minority Stock Issuance (the  Plan of
Reorganization ). Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, which was approved by the Bank s members at a special meeting of members held on March 21, 2006, the Bank will: (i) convert to a stock savings bank ( Stock
Bank ) as the successor to the Bank in its current mutual form; (ii) organize the Company as a federally chartered corporation that will own 100% of the common stock of the Stock Bank; and (iii) organize United Community MHC (the
 MHC ) as a federally chartered mutual holding company that will own at least 51% of the common stock of the Company so long as the MHC remains in existence. The Stock Bank will succeed to the business and operations of the Bank in its
mutual form and the Company will sell a minority interest in its common stock in a public stock offering.      Following the completion of the reorganization,
all depositors who had membership or liquidation rights with respect to the Bank as of the effective date of the reorganization will continue to have such rights solely with respect to the MHC so long as they continue to hold deposit accounts with
the Bank. In addition, all persons who become depositors of the Bank subsequent to the reorganization will have such membership and liquidation rights with respect to the MHC.      The Company plans to offer to the public shares of common stock representing a minority ownership of the estimated pro forma market value of the Bank as determined by an independent appraisal. The MHC will maintain
the majority ownership of the Company. Cost incurred in connection with the offering will be recorded as a reduction of the proceeds from the offering. If the transaction is not consummated, all costs incurred in connection with the transaction will
be expensed. At December 31, 2005, reorganization costs of approximately $429,000 had been included in other assets.      EFFECT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS      In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123R,  Share-Based Payment . SFAS No. 123R establishes the accounting standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services. SFAS No. 123R
requires that the cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. The statement eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions, including stock option grants, using the
intrinsic value method and generally requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method. The SFAS No. 123R replaces SFAS No. 123 and supersedes Accounting Principles Board No. 25. The
pronouncement is effective for non-accelerated filers for periods beginning after December 15, 2005 with early application allowed. Management is currently evaluating the effect of the pronouncement on the Company s financial statements.
     In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154  Accounting Changes and Error Corrections - a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB
Statement No. 3. SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. The statement applies to all voluntary changes and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the
unusual instance where the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions. The statement requires retrospective application to prior periods  financial statements of changes in accounting principle. Retroactive application is
defined as the application of the accounting change to prior accounting periods as if the principle had always been utilized. Restatement is also defined as the revising of a previously issued financial statement to reflect the correction of an
error. The statement applies to periods beginning after December 15, 2005 with early application allowed.

Item 2. Management Discussion and Analysis        Forward-Looking Statements       This report contains forward-looking statements that are based on assumptions and may describe future plans, strategies and expectations of the Bank. These
forward-looking statements are generally identified by use of the words  believe,   expect,   intend,   anticipate,   estimate,   project  or similar expressions. The Bank s ability to
predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the Bank and its subsidiaries include, but are not limited to, changes in interest
rates, national and regional economic conditions, legislative and regulatory changes, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government, including policies of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board, the quality and composition of the loan
or investment portfolios, demand for loan products, deposit flows, competition, demand for financial services in the Bank s market area, changes in real estate market values in the Bank s market area, and changes in relevant accounting
principles and guidelines. These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Except as required by applicable law or regulation, the Bank does not
undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to release publicly the result of any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of the statements or to reflect the occurrence
of anticipated or unanticipated events.       Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2005 and June 30, 2005       Total assets decreased by $7.9 million during the period from June 30, 2005 to December 31, 2005, primarily due to a decrease in deposits of
$8.3 million which was the result of a withdrawal of municipal deposits to enable the withdrawing municipality to satisfy payment obligations to other municipalities. During this period cash and cash equivalents decreased $69.7 million as we
reinvested the proceeds of significant municipal deposits received at the end of June 2005. As a result, securities increased by $23.9 million, mortgage-backed securities increased by $23.1 million and loans increased by $13.8 million during the six
months ended December 31, 2005. Equity increased by $599,000, or 2.0%, from $29.7 million at June 30, 2005 to $30.3 million at December 31, 2005 as a result of $1.1 million in net income, offset by a decrease in value of investments
held available for sale of $501,000.       Comparison of Operating Results for the Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004    
    General.   Net income increased $17,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2005 compared to the three months ended
December 31, 2004, primarily due to a $134,000 increase in net interest income, a $337,000 decrease in provision for loan losses, which were offset by a $390,000 decrease in other income, and a $49,000 increase in other expense.      Net income increased $48,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2005 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to a
$234,000 increase in net interest income and a $337,000 decrease in provision for loan losses, partially offset by a $350,000 decrease in other income and a $116,000 increase in other expenses.        Net Interest Income   .  Net interest income increased $134,000, or 6.2%, to $2.3 million for the three months ended December 31,
2005 compared to the year earlier period primarily due to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets of $66.2 million, combined with an increase in average yield on earning assets from 5.27% to 5.46%. The increase in the average
balance of interest-earning assets was primarily due to the deployment of municipal deposits into loans and investment securities. Increases in the average yield were primarily the result of increases in market interest rates. During the same period
the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased by $73.6 million primarily due to an increase of $60.3 million in municipal deposits, and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities increased from 1.84% to 2.57% primarily as a
result of increases in market interest rates.      Net interest income increased $234,000, or 5.3%, to $4.6 million for the six months ended
December 31, 2005 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily due to a $61.8 million increase in average interest earnings assets primarily attributable to the combined effect of the deployment of
municipal deposits and an increase in average yield on earning assets from 5.20% to 5.42%. The increase in average yield was primarily due to an increase in market interest rates. During the same period the average balances on interest bearing
liabilities increased by $60.3 million primarily due to an increase in municipal deposits, and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities increased from 1.74% to 2.54% due to an increase in market interest rates.

Table of Contents  

   Interest income increased $1.0 million, or 31.7%, for the three months ended December 31, 2005 as a
result of a $493,000 increase in loan interest and a $382,000 increase in investment interest. Interest income increased $1.9 million, or 30.1%, for the six months ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a $942,000 increase in loan interest and
a $580,000 increase in investment securities interest. The increases in interest income is primarily due to the combined effect of an increase in average interest-earning assets and an increase in average yields due to market interest rate
increases. The increases in investment securities interest income is primarily due to the increase in the average balance of investment securities caused by the deployment of municipal deposits into investment securities.      Interest expense increased $886,000, or 84.2%, for the three months ended December 31, 2005 primarily as a result of a $792,000 increase in interest
paid on NOW and money market deposit accounts and a $138,000 increase paid on certificates of deposit primarily due to an increase in market interest rates. Interest expense increased $1.7 million, or 83.2%, for the six months ended
December 31, 2005 primarily as a result of a $1.5 million increase in NOW and money market deposit account interest.        Provision
for Loan Losses   .  The following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses for the three and six months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.       
    The provision for loan losses decreased in both the three and six months ended December 31,
2005 compared to the respective prior year periods. The provision for loan losses in the 2004 periods reflects the effect of the updating of our loan loss allowance methodology during fiscal 2005 as discussed under   Management s
Discussion of Operations Risk Management Analyses and Determination of the Allowance for Loan Losses   in the Company s registration statement on form S-1, as amended. The provision for loan losses of $30,000 and $60,000
during the three and six months ended December 31, 2005, respectively, reflects the continued increases in the portfolios of non-residential real estate and land loans, multi-family loans, construction loans, commercial business loans and
consumer loans as a percentage of the total loan portfolio. These loan types are generally considered to have a greater inherent risk of loss than one- to four-family mortgage loans.

Table of Contents  

   The following table provides information with respect to our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated.
We did not have any troubled debt restructurings or any accruing loans past due 90 days or more at the dates presented.       
      Other Income   .  The following table summarizes other income for the three and
six months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.       
    Other income decreased $390,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2005 from the
prior year period primarily due to the absence of a $304,000 gain on the sale of investments in 2005. The 2004 period included the sale of equity securities that we received in exchange for debt securities of the issuer in a recapitalization
transaction by the issuer. We sold the equity securities to satisfy bank regulatory requirements. Also contributing to the decrease in other income was a $130,000 decrease in the category of other income. The decrease in other income was the
combined effect of the absence of a $40,000 payment received during the 2004 period for a previously discharged obligation, a $30,000 reduction in fees earned by United Community Financial Services and a general decrease in other noninterest income.
Other income decreased $350,000 during the six months ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to a $320,000 reduction in gain on the sale of investments (described above) and a $110,000 decrease in the category of other income, partially offset
by a $68,000 increase in service charge income. The decrease in the category of other income was the result of the combined effect of a $20,000 decrease in fees earned by United Community Bank Financial Services, a $40,000 payment received for a
previously discharged obligation and a general decrease in other noninterest income. The increase in service charge income is primarily due to increased ATM services charges due to increased usage.

Table of Contents  

     Other Expense   .  The following table summarizes other expense for the three and six
months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.       
    Other expense increased $49,000 during the three months ended December 31, 2005 primarily due
to a $33,000 increase in other operating expense, partially offset by a $12,000 decrease in compensation and employee benefit expense. Other expense increased $116,000 during the six months ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to a $41,000
increase in advertising expense, a $32,000 increase in ATM service fees, and a $61,000 increase in other operating expense, partially offset by a $33,000 decrease in compensation and employee benefit expense. The increase in advertising expense was
due to a general increase in our use of advertising services. The increase in ATM service charges was the result of increased volume in ATM usage. The increase in other operating expense is primarily due to inflationary increases in other expenses.
The decrease in compensation and employee benefit expense is primarily the result of reduced costs of our supplemental executive retirement plan and insurance costs and a $20,000 decrease in data processing expense. The decrease in data processing
expense was the result of incentives we received for renewing our data processing agreement.        Income Taxes   .  The
provision for income taxes increased from $288,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2004 to $303,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2005 due to an increase in pre-tax income from $811,000 to $843,000 for these periods. The
provision for income taxes increased from $569,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2004 to $626,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2005 due to an increase in pre-tax income from $1.6 million to $1.7 million for these periods.
       Liquidity Management   .  Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term
nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, maturities and sales of securities and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities
are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition.      We regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: (1) expected loan demands; (2) expected deposit flows, in particular municipal deposit flows; (3) yields available on
interest-earning deposits and securities; and (4) the objectives of our asset/liability management policy.      Our most liquid assets are
cash and cash equivalents. The levels of these assets depend on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $6.5 million and $76.3 million at December 31, 2005 and
June 30, 2005, respectively. Securities classified as available-for-sale whose market value exceeds our cost, which provide additional sources of liquidity, totaled $7.8 million and $6.1 million at December 31, 2005 and June 30, 2005,
respectively. Total securities classified as available-for-sale were $85.2 million and $38.1 million at December 31, 2005 and June 30, 2005, respectively. In addition, at June 30, 2005, we had the ability to borrow a total of
approximately $85 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis.      At December 31 2005 and June 30, 2005, we had $25.5
million and $19.9 million in loan commitments outstanding, respectively. At December 31 2005, this consisted of $8.4 million of mortgage loan commitments, $13.0 million in unused home equity lines of credit and $4.1 million in commercial lines
of credit. At December 31 2005 we also had $3.3 million of letters of credit outstanding compared to $2.0 million at June 30, 2005. At June 30, 2005, we had $6.7 million in mortgage loan commitments, $12.1 million in unused home
equity lines of credit and $1.1 million in commercial lines of credit. Certificates of deposit due within one year of December 31, 2005 and June 30, 2005 totaled $74.1 million and $69.3 million, respectively. This represented 72.0% and
66.3% of certificates of deposit at December 31 2005 and June 30, 2005, respectively. We believe the large percentage of certificates of deposit

that mature within one year reflects customers  hesitancy to invest their funds for long periods in the current low interest rate environment. If these
maturing deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other certificates of deposit and borrowings. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other
borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before June 30, 2006. We believe, however, based on past experience, that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us. We have the ability to
attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered.      The following table presents certain of our contractual obligations
as of December 31 2005 and June 30, 2005.       
    Our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of loans and the purchase of
securities. Our primary financing activities consist of activity in deposit accounts and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by us and our local
competitors and other factors. We generally manage the pricing of our deposits to be competitive and to increase core deposit relationships. Occasionally, we offer promotional rates on certain deposit products to attract deposits.

     Capital Management.   As a mutual savings bank, we have managed our capital to maintain
strong protection for depositors and creditors. We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Office of Thrift Supervision, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a
definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At December 31, 2005 and June 30, 2005, we exceeded all of our regulatory
capital requirements. We are considered  well capitalized  under regulatory guidelines      The capital from the stock offering is
expected to increase our consolidated equity by $26.4 million to $56.1 million at the maximum of the offering. See  Capitalization.  Following completion of the offering, we also will manage our capital for maximum stockholder benefit. The
capital from the offering will significantly increase our liquidity and capital resources. Over time, the initial level of liquidity will be reduced as net proceeds from the stock offering are used for general corporate purposes, including the
funding of lending activities. Our financial condition and results of operations are expected to be enhanced by the capital from the offering, resulting in increased net interest-earning assets and net income. However, the large increase in equity
resulting from the capital raised in the offering will, initially, have an adverse impact on our return on equity. Following the offering, we may use capital management tools such as cash dividends and common share repurchases. However, under Office
of Thrift Supervision regulations, we will not be allowed to repurchase any shares during the first year following the offering, except to fund the restricted stock awards under the equity incentive plan, unless extraordinary circumstances exist and
we receive regulatory approval.        Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.   In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety
of financial transactions that, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk.
Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers  requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments, letters of credit and lines of credit. For information about our loan commitments and unused lines of credit, see note 19 of
the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We currently have no plans to engage in hedging activities in the future.      For the
years ended June 30, 2005 and June 30, 2004 and as of the six months ended December 31, 2005, we engaged in no off-balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.       For a discussion of the Bank s asset and
liability management policies as well as the potential impact of interest rate changes upon the market value of the Bank s portfolio equity, see  Management s Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations   Risk
Management  in the Company s Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended. The main components of market risk for the Bank are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Bank manages interest rate risk and liquidity risk by establishing
and monitoring the volume, maturities, pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity, growth, risk limits and profitability goals. Model
simulation is used to measure earnings volatility under both rising and falling rate scenarios.      We use a net portfolio value analyses prepared by the
Office of Thrift Supervision to review our level of interest rate risk. This analysis measures interest rate risk by computing changes in net portfolio value of our cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items in the event of a
range of assumed changes in market interest rates. Net portfolio value represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities, with adjustments made for off-balance sheet
items. These analyses assess the risk of loss in market risk-sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained 100 to 300 basis point increase or 100 and 200 basis point decrease in market interest rates with no effect given to any steps
that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement. Because of the low level of market interest rates, these analyses are not performed for decreases of more than 200 basis points.      The following table, which is based on information that we provide to the Office of Thrift Supervision, presents the change in our net portfolio value at
December 31, 2005 that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates based on Office of Thrift Supervision assumptions, with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counteract that change.       
    The Office of Thrift Supervision uses various assumptions in assessing interest rate risk. These
assumptions relate to interest rates, loan prepayment rates, deposit decay rates and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios, among others. As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings
are inherent in the methods of analyses presented in the foregoing tables. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest
rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Additionally, certain assets, such
as adjustable-rate mortgage loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, expected rates of prepayments on loans and early
withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. Prepayment rates can have a significant impact on interest income. Because of the large percentage of loans and mortgage-backed securities we
hold, rising or falling interest rates have a significant impact on the prepayment speeds of our earning assets that in turn affect the rate sensitivity position. When interest rates rise, prepayments tend to slow. When interest rates fall,
prepayments tend to rise. Our asset sensitivity would be reduced if prepayments slow and vice versa. While we believe these assumptions to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future
mortgage-backed security and loan repayment activity.       
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures.       The Company s management, including the Company s principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the
 Exchange Act ). Based upon their evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were
