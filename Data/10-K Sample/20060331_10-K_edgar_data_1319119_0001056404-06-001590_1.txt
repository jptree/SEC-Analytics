REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To PHH Mortgage Corporation:

We have examined PHH Mortgage Corporation's (the "Company") compliance with its
established minimum servicing standards described in the accompanying
Management's Assertion, dated February 28, 2006, as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2005. Management is responsible for compliance with those minimum
servicing standards. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company's compliance based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants as adopted
by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with its
minimum servicing standards and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a
legal determination on the Company's compliance with its minimum servicing
standards.

Our examination disclosed the following instance of material noncompliance with
the reconciliation of custodial bank accounts applicable to the Company during
the year ended December 31, 2005. The Company did not comply with the
requirement to prepare custodial bank account reconciliations within 45 calendar
days after the cutoff date and the requirement to resolve reconciling items
within 90 calendar days of their original identification as specified by their
minimum servicing standards.

In our opinion, except for the material noncompliance described in the preceding
paragraph, the Company complied, in all material respects, with the
aforementioned minimum servicing standards as of and for the year ended December
31, 2005, as set forth in Appendix I.
