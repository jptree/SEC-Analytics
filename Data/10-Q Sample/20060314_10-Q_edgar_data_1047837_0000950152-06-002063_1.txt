ARGO-TECH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES   
(A Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of AT Holdings Corporation) 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
FOR THE 13 WEEK PERIODS ENDED JANUARY 28, 2006 AND JANUARY 29, 2005 (Predecessor)   
(Unaudited) 

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The principal operations of Argo-Tech Corporation (a wholly-owned subsidiary of AT Holdings
Corporation ( Holdings )) and its subsidiaries ( Argo-Tech  or the  Company ) include the
design, manufacture and distribution of aviation products, primarily aircraft fuel pumps. In
addition, Argo-Tech leases a portion of its Cleveland, Ohio manufacturing facility to other
parties. Argo-Tech s fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in October.

On October 28, 2005, Holdings consummated a merger with Vaughn Merger Sub, Inc. ( Vaughn ) in
which Vaughn merged with and into Holdings (the  Merger ), with Holdings surviving as a wholly
owned subsidiary of V.G.A.T Investors, LLC. The Merger was accounted for as a purchase and
preliminary fair value adjustments to the Company s assets and liabilities were recorded as of
the date of the Merger. The Company is in the process of obtaining third-party valuations of
certain tangible and intangible assets; thus, the allocation of the purchase price to the
Company s assets and liabilities is subject to adjustment.

Argo-Tech Corporation is a parent holding company and all of its domestic subsidiaries guarantee
Argo-Tech s senior notes issued in June 2004. Argo-Tech also has two wholly-owned,
non-guarantor foreign subsidiaries which have inconsequential assets, liabilities and equity.
Argo-Tech has no outside assets, liabilities or operations apart from its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. The senior notes are fully, unconditionally, jointly and severally guaranteed by
the guarantor subsidiaries, and therefore, separate financial statements of the guarantor
subsidiaries will not be presented. Management has determined that the information presented by
such separate financial statements is not material to investors.

2. UNAUDITED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

The financial information included herein is unaudited; however, the information reflects all
adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of
management, necessary for a fair presentation of Argo-Tech s financial position, results of
operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. These financial statements and
notes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in
Argo-Tech s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 29, 2005. The results of
operations for the 13 week period ended January 28, 2006 are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for the full year.

3. INVENTORIES 

Inventories are stated at standard cost which approximates the costs which would be determined
using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The recorded value of inventories is not in excess of market value. The balance at January 28, 2006 and October 29, 2005 includes $13.8 million and
$40.3 million, respectively, of purchase price accounting adjustments recorded in conjunction with the Merger. Inventories
consist of the following (in thousands):

Table of Contents   

4. INTANGIBLE ASSETS 

The following is a summary of intangible assets, other than goodwill (in thousands):

Amortization expense recorded on the intangible assets for the 13 week periods ended January 28,
2006 and January 29, 2005 was $3.0 million and $0.9 million, respectively. The estimated
amortization expense for each of fiscal years 2006 through 2010 is $11.8 million. The
weighted-average amortization period for contracts is 10 years, customer relationships is 20
years and patents is 9 years.

5. PRODUCT WARRANTY 

Argo-Tech accrues for warranty obligations for products sold based on management estimates of
the amount that may be required to settle such potential obligations. These estimates are
prepared with support from our sales, engineering, quality and legal functions. This accrual,
which is reviewed in detail on a regular basis, is based on several factors: past experience,
current claims, production changes and various other considerations. The following table
presents a reconciliation of changes in the product warranty liability for the 13 week periods
ended January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005 (in thousands):

6. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 

The Company has two noncontributory defined benefit pension plans, one for qualifying hourly
employees and a second for qualifying salaried employees. The salaried employee plan provides
pension benefits that are based on the employees  compensation and years of service. The
future accrual of

7

Table of Contents   

benefits under this plan was terminated in connection with the formation of the Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (ESOP). The hourly employee plan provides benefits of stated amounts for each
year of service. The Company s funding policy is to contribute actuarially determined amounts
allowable under Internal Revenue Service regulations.

A summary of the components of net periodic benefit cost for the pension plans is as follows
(in thousands):

Argo-Tech expects to contribute $1,064,000 to the hourly pension plan in 2006. As of January
28, 2006 no contributions have been made.

The Company also provides certain postretirement health care benefits to qualifying hourly
retirees and their dependents. This benefit is not funded.

A summary of the components of net periodic benefit cost for the postretirement benefit is as
follows (in thousands):

7. CONTINGENCIES 

Environmental Matters   The soil and groundwater at Argo-Tech s Euclid, Ohio facility and Costa
Mesa, California facility contain elevated levels of certain contaminants which are currently in
the process of being removed and/or remediated. Because Argo-Tech has certain indemnification
rights from former owners of the facilities for liabilities arising from these or other
environmental matters, in the opinion of Argo-Tech s management, the ultimate outcome is not
expected to materially affect its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Other Matters   Argo-Tech is subject to various legal actions and other contingencies arising in
the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of Argo-Tech s management, after reviewing the
information which is currently available with respect to such matters and consulting with Argo-Tech s legal
counsel, any liability which may ultimately be incurred with respect to these matters is not
expected to materially affect Argo-Tech s financial condition, results of operations or
liquidity.

8. SEGMENT INFORMATION 

Argo-Tech operates in two business segments: Aerospace and Industrial. The Aerospace segment
includes the design, manufacture, distribution, and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) of
aviation

8

Table of Contents   

products, consisting of aircraft fuel pumps, fuel flow related products found on a plane s
airframe, and aerial refueling pumps and related equipment. The Industrial segment
includes the design, manufacture and distribution of ground fueling valves and related
components, specialty industrial hose, cryogenic pumps and nozzles for transferring
liquefied natural gas and operation of a business park in Cleveland, Ohio where we maintain
our headquarters and one of our production facilities. Corporate primarily includes
expenses not specifically identified or charged to the operating business segments for
measurement of operating performance. These expenses include, but are not limited to,
certain depreciation, early retirement expenses, stock option compensation and stock
appreciation rights expense.

Argo-Tech evaluates the performance of its segments based primarily on operating profit before
amortization of inventory fair value step-up, amortization of deferred financing fees and other
identified intangibles, interest expense, interest income, other miscellaneous fees and income
taxes.

The following table presents revenues and other financial information by business segment (in

10. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard ( SFAS ) No. 123(R),  Share Based Payment,  which requires all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized
in the financial statements based on their fair values. The Company will adopt the provisions
of this statement for the Company s fiscal year beginning October 29, 2006 using the modified
prospective method. Management has not determined the effect the adoption of this statement
will have on Argo-Tech s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47,  Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirements an interpretation of SFAS No. 143  ( FIN 47 ). FIN 47 clarifies that uncertainty
about the timing and (or) method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation
should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to
make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the obligation. The provisions of this
interpretation are effective for the Company s fiscal year ending October 28, 2006. Management has not determined the impact, if any, that this
interpretation will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS .

Overview 

Argo-Tech is a global designer, manufacturer and servicer of high performance fuel flow devices
and systems. We operate in two business segments, Aerospace and Industrial. The Aerospace
segment consists of aircraft engine fuel pumps and other engine products, commercial and
military products and systems found on a plane s airframe, and aerial refueling pumps and
related equipment. The Industrial segment includes ground fueling nozzles, hoses and other
ground fueling components, an automated fuel management system, cryogenic pumps and nozzles and
the operation of a business park in Cleveland, Ohio. The Corporate classification primarily
includes expenses not specifically identified or charged to the operating business segments for
measurement of operating performance. These expenses include, but are not limited to, certain
depreciation, early retirement expenses, and compensation related to Stock Appreciation Rights
(SARs).

10

Table of Contents   

The following is management s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors which have
affected Argo-Tech s financial position and operating results during the periods presented in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Management has included gross margin
excluding the amortization of the step-up of inventory to fair market value, a non-GAAP
financial measure, as a useful indicator of the Company s performance as compared to the prior
period. Argo-Tech s fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of October and is identified
according to the calendar year in which it ends.

Export Sales 

Substantially all of our export sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Export sales for the 13
week period ended January 28, 2006 were $22.8 million. Sales to Europe were $11.4 million,
sales to Pacific Rim countries were $7.4 million and sales to all other regions, individually
less than 10%, were $4.0 million for the 13 week period ended January 28, 2006.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these
financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and
on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of
operations. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies as stated in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 29, 2005.

Fluctuations of Operating Results; Limitation of Quarterly Comparisons 

Argo-Tech s results of operations are subject to fluctuations from quarter to quarter due to
changes in demand for our products, changes in product mix and other factors. Demand for our
products can vary from quarter to quarter due to changes in demand for, and timing of
deliveries of, OEM, aftermarket and military products and services. In particular, the timing
of Argo-Tech s aftermarket sales tends not to occur on a predictable schedule and, furthermore,
the sales tend to occur in large quantities that can significantly impact quarterly comparisons. Accordingly, year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter
comparisons of quarterly results may not be meaningful, and quarterly results during the year
are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period or for
the entire year.

Results of Operations for the 13 Week Period Ended January 28, 2006 Compared With the 13 Week
Period Ended January 29, 2005 

Net revenues for the 13 week period ended January 28, 2006 increased $4.8 million, or 10.1%, to
$52.2 million from $47.4 million for the 13 week period ended January 29, 2005. This increase
was due to an increase in aerospace revenues of $2.9 million and $1.9 million in industrial
revenues. The increase in aerospace revenues was attributable to an increase of $4.3 million of commercial aerospace
revenues and a decrease of $1.4 million of military revenues. Commercial OEM revenues
increased $2.7 million, or 48.2%, to $8.3 million and commercial aftermarket revenues increased
$1.5 million, or 8.3%, to $19.5 million in the 13 week period ended January 28, 2006.
Commercial OEM revenues increased primarily as a result of an increase in pump requirements
from our customers. Commercial aftermarket revenues were higher primarily due to an increase
in repair and overhaul activities offset by a slight decrease in the demand for spare parts.
Military revenues decreased primarily due to a reduction in revenues related to OEM airframe
components, partially offset by an increase in OEM airframe development programs. The $1.9
million increase in industrial revenues was primarily attributable to an increase of $1.5
million in cryogenic pump revenues and an increase in commercial and military ground fueling
revenues, partially offset by a decrease in business park revenues related to a tenant not
renewing a lease.

Table of Contents   

Aerospace gross profit for the 13 week period ended January 28, 2006 decreased $21.4
million, or 128.9%, to a loss of $4.8 million from a profit of $16.6 million in the 13 week
period ended January 29, 2005. Gross margin decreased to a negative 12.2% for the 13 week
period ended January 28, 2006 from 45.6% in the 13 week period ended January 29, 2005. The
decrease in gross profit and gross margin is primarily attributable to the amortization related
to the step-up of inventory to fair market value. Gross profit was also impacted by the sales
of higher margin commercial aerospace aftermarket products and a reduction of non-cash
compensation expense associated with the ESOP benefit plan that was terminated in connection
with the Merger, partially offset by an increase in compensation expense related to the company
match for the 401(k) benefit plan and a decrease in sales of military products. Excluding the
$22.3 million amortization related to the step-up of inventory to fair market value, the
aerospace gross margin for the 13 week period ended January 28, 2006 would have been 44.5%.
Industrial gross profit for the 13 week period ended January 28, 2006 decreased $4.9 million,
or 119.5%, to a loss of $0.8 million from a profit of $4.1 million in the 13 week period ended
January 29, 2005. Gross margin decreased to a negative 6.2% in the 13 week period ended
January 28, 2006 from 37.3% in the 13 week period ended January 29, 2005. The decrease in
gross profit and gross margin was primarily attributable to the amortization related to the
step-up of inventory to fair market value. Gross profit was also negatively impacted by an
increase in manufacturing costs on cryogenic pump products and an increase in utility costs
associated with the operation of our business park, partially offset by a more favorable sales
mix of ground fueling products. Excluding the $4.2 million amortization related to the step-up
of inventory to fair market value, the industrial gross margin for the 13 week period ended
January 28, 2006 would have been 25.6%

Operating expenses for the 13 week period ended January 28, 2006 increased $2.9 million, or
27.9%, to $13.3 million from $10.4 million in the 13 week period ended January 29, 2005. This
increase is primarily attributable to an increase of $2.1 million of non-cash amortization of
additional intangible assets as a result of the Merger, $0.6 million in selling, general and
administrative expenses and a $0.2 million increase in research and development expenses. The
increase in selling, general and administrative expense is primarily related to an increase in
compensation and marketing expenses and an increase in compensation expense related to the
company match for the 401(k) benefit plan partially offset by a reduction of non-cash
compensation expense associated with the ESOP benefit plan that was terminated in connection
with the Merger. The increase in research and development expenses is primarily due to a
decrease in customer-paid development expenses. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues
increased to 25.5% for the 13 week period ended January 28, 2006 as compared to 21.9% for the
13 week period ended January 29, 2005.

Income (loss) from operations for the 13 week period ended January 28, 2006 decreased $29.5
million to a loss of $19.3 million from $10.2 million of income in the 13 week period ended
January 29, 2005. The decrease in income is primarily attributable to the amortization related
to the step-up of inventory to fair market value, an increase in manufacturing costs on
cryogenic pump products, an increase in utility costs associated with the operation of our
business park, an increase in the non-cash amortization of additional intangible assets, the
increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and the increase in research and
development, partially offset by a more favorable sales mix of ground fueling products and the
net favorable change in compensation expense associated with our benefit plans. Excluding the
$26.5 million amortization related to the step-up of inventory to fair market value, income from operations,
as a percentage of revenue, for the 13 week period ended January 28, 2006 would have been 13.8%
compared to 21.5% for the 13 week period ended January 29, 2005.

Interest expense for the 13 week period ended January 28, 2006 decreased $0.4 million, or 6.3%,
to $5.9 million from $6.3 million in the 13 week period ended January 29, 2005 primarily due to
the non-cash purchase accounting amortization of the write-up on the $250.0 million of 9-1/4%
senior notes issued in June 2004 required as a result of the Merger.

The income tax benefit was $10.3 million for the 13 week period ended January 28, 2006 as
compared to a provision of $1.1 million for the 13 week period ended January 29, 2005. This is
primarily due to the pre-tax loss.

12

Table of Contents   

Net income (loss) for the 13 week period ended January 28, 2006 decreased $17.7 million to
a loss of $14.9 million from income of $2.8 million for the 13 week period ended January 29,
2005, primarily due to the revenue and expense factors discussed above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Argo-Tech is a holding company that receives all of its operating income from its subsidiaries.
As a result, Argo-Tech s primary source of liquidity for conducting business activities and
servicing its indebtedness has been cash flows from operating activities.

Cash and cash equivalents for the 13 week period ended January 28, 2006 decreased $11.6 million
to $2.3 million primarily as a result of a use of $19.2 million for operating activities,
partially offset by $7.9 million of cash provided by financing activities. The cash used in
operating activities was primarily due to a reduction in accrued and other liabilities for the
payment of interest on the $250.0 million 9-1/4% senior notes, accrued payments in connection
with the Merger, an increase in inventory and prepaid expenses. The cash provided by financing
activities was primarily due to a net increase in borrowing on the revolving line of credit,
partially offset by intercompany activity with our Parent.

Capital expenditures for the 13 week period ended January 28, 2006 totaled $0.3 million
compared to $0.7 million for the 13 week period ended January 29, 2005. Argo-Tech expects to
incur capital expenditures of approximately $5.2 million for the remainder of fiscal year 2006
relating to the continued maintenance of facilities, equipment and systems to support current
operating activities.

Long-term debt at January 28, 2006 consisted of $18.9 million principal amount of our term
loan, $10.0 million of revolving credit and $250.0 million of senior notes (excluding the $9.5
million of fair value associated with purchase accounting). Scheduled payments of $0.2 million
were made on the term loan and $2.0 million was paid on the revolving loan in the 13 week
period ended January 28, 2006. Our amended and restated senior credit facility provides for a
$40.0 million revolving credit facility and a $19.1 million term loan facility. At January 28,
2006, Argo-Tech has available $19.6 million revolving credit facility, after $10.4 million in
letters of credit and $10.0 million of revolving borrowings. The credit facility contains no
restrictions on the ability of Argo-Tech s subsidiaries to make distributions to Argo-Tech.

Our expected future contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments for the next
several fiscal years, as of January 28, 2006, are as follows (in millions):

(1) 
       
       Contractual obligations for the remainder of fiscal 2006. 

(2) 
       
       Represents interest payments on the senior notes and the term loans, estimated funding
for retirement and other post-employment benefits and other long-term commitments.

Table of Contents   

We believe that cash flow from operations will provide adequate funds for our working capital
needs, planned capital expenditures and near term debt service obligations. Our ability to
fund our operations, make planned capital expenditures, and to make scheduled payments on our
indebtedness depends on our future operating performance and cash flow. We may need to
refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable
terms or at all. These items are subject to prevailing conditions and to financial, business,
and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.

Certain Factors That May Affect Future Results 

From time to time, information provided by Argo-Tech, statements by its employees or
information included in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including
those portions of the Management s Discussion and Analysis that refer to the future) may
contain forward-looking statements that are not historical facts. Those statements are
 forward-looking  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Such forward-looking statements, and Argo-Tech s future performance, operating results,
financial position and liquidity, are subject to a variety of factors that could materially
affect results. Some, but not necessarily all, of these factors include:

changes and/or cyclicality in the aerospace industry; 

governmental regulation and oversight in the aerospace industry; 

levels of competition in the aerospace industry; 

the impact of terrorism and war on airline travel and the airline industry; 

our ability to meet future capital requirements; 

loss of a significant customer; 

risks associated with fixed-price contracts; 

costs associated with product liability and warranty claims; 

risks associated with our international operations; 

changes in environmental or other applicable governmental regulations; 

reduction in military and/or defense spending and risks associated with
government contracts; 

changes in our relationship with our employees; 

availability of essential materials used in our products; 

risks associated with protection of our intellectual property rights; 

the other factors described in Argo-Tech s annual report on Form 10-K for the
year ended October 29, 2005; and 

other unforeseen circumstances.

ITEM
3. 

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 

In the ordinary course of operations, Argo-Tech s major market risk exposure is to changing
interest rates, primarily with respect to its long-term debt obligations. At January 28, 2006,
Argo-Tech had fixed rate debt totaling $250.0 million at 9.25% and variable rate debt under its
existing credit facility of $28.9 million calculated, at Argo-Tech s choice, using an alternate
base rate (ABR) or LIBOR, plus a supplemental percentage determined by the ratio of debt to
adjusted EBITDA. The variable rate is not to exceed ABR plus 1.25% or LIBOR plus 2.75%.
Argo-Tech currently has no derivative contracts and does not enter into derivative contracts
for trading or speculative purposes. A 10% fluctuation in interest rates would not materially
affect Argo-Tech s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 4.  

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The management of Argo-Tech,
including its Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the
effectiveness of Argo-Tech s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of January 28, 2006.
Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that Argo-Tech s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by Argo-Tech in the reports
that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange
Commission s rules and forms.

(b) Changes in internal controls. There were no changes in Argo-Tech s internal control
over financial reporting or in other factors during the quarter ended January 28, 2006
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Argo-Tech s
internal control over financial reporting.

(c) Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires management to report on, and its independent
auditors to attest to, Argo-Tech s internal control over financial reporting in its annual
report, beginning with the annual report for Argo-Tech s fiscal year ending October 27, 2007.
Argo-Tech is actively continuing its ongoing internal process of documenting, testing and
evaluating the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting utilizing outside
assistance.
