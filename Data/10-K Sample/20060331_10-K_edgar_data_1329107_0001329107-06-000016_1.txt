Independant Accountants Report

Exhibit
          99.2  

            Report
          of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   

To
          General Electric Capital Corporation: 

We
          have
          examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Appendix I, that
          General Electric Capital Corporation (Company), complied with the minimum
          servicing standards as set forth in the Mortgage Bankers Association of
          America s Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers (USAP), as
          related to the following transaction: 

as
          of and
          for the year ended December 31, 2005. Management is responsible for the
          Company s compliance with those minimum servicing standards. Our responsibility
          is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s
          compliance based on our examination. 

Our
          examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established
          by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and,
          accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about Management s
          compliance with the minimum servicing standards and performing such other
          procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
          that our
          examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination
          does
          not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the minimum
          servicing standards. 

In
          our
          opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the
          aforementioned servicing standards, as related to GECEF 2005-1, as of and
          for
          the year ended December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
          respects.

        effective internal control over compliance with these minimum servicing
        standards. We have performed an evaluation of the Company s compliance with the
        minimum servicing standards as related to GECEF 2005-1, as of and for the

        the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company complied, in all material
        respects, with the minimum servicing standards, as related to GECEF 2005-1.
