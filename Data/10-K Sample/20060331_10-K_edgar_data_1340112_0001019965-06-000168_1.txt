 HarborView Mortgage Loan Trust 2005-12 Mortgage Loan Pass-Through Certificates Series 2005-12

 Based on my knowledge and upon the annual compliance statement included in the report and required to be delivered to  the trustee in accordance with the terms of the pooling and servicing or similar, agreement, and except as disclosed in the  reports, the servicer has fulfilled its obligations under the servicing agreement; and

 The reports disclose all significant deficiencies relating to the servicer's compliance with the minimum servicing standards  based upon the report provided by an independent public accountant, after conducting a review in compliance with the  Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers or similar procedure, as set forth in the pooling and servicing, or  similar, agreement, that is included in these reports.

Independent Accountants' Report

The Board of Directors
Countrywide Financial Corporation:

We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying Management
Assertion, that Countrywide Financial Corporation and subsidiaries, including
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. ("CHL"), and
Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, L.P., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CHL,
(collectively, the "Company") complied with the minimum servicing standards
set forth in the Mortgage Bankers Association of America's Uniform Single
Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers (USAP) as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2005. Management is responsible for the Company's compliance with
those minimum servicing standards. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management's assertion about the Company's compliance based on our
examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and,
accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the
Company's compliance with the minimum servicing standards specified above and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the
Company's compliance with the minimum servicing standards.

In our opinion, management's assertion that Countrywide Financial Corporation
and subsidiaries, including its wholly-owned subsidiary, Countrywide Home
Loans, Inc. ("CHL"), and Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, L.P., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of CHL, complied with the aforementioned minimum servicing standards
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 is fairly stated, in all
material respects.
