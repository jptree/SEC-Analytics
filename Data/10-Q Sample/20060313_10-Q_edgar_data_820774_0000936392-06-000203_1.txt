NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 
JANUARY 31, 2006

NOTE 1   Basis of Presentation. 

In the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and related
interim condensed consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include all adjustments
(consisting only of normal recurring items) necessary for their fair presentation. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Interim
results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year.

Certain information in footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements has been
condensed or omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the  SEC ). The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in
conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations, and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the annual
report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2005, filed with the SEC on February 1, 2006
and on Form 10-K/A for the same period ended, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2006.

Shipping and Handling Revenue 

The Company includes payments from its customers for shipping and handling in its net revenues
line item in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) 00-10,  Accounting for Shipping
and Handling Fees and Costs .

Cost of Goods Sold 

The Company includes F.O.B. purchase price, inbound freight charges, duty, buying commissions
and overhead in its cost of goods sold line item. Overhead costs include purchasing and
receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing costs, internal transfers costs and other costs
associated with the Company s distribution. The Company does not exclude any of these costs
from cost of goods sold.

Shipping and Handling Expenses 

Shipping expenses, which consist primarily of payments made to freight companies, are reported
in selling, general and administrative expenses. Shipping expenses for the quarters ended
January 31, 2006 and 2005 were $546,000 and $530,000, respectively.

Reclassifications 

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods  condensed consolidated financial
statements to conform to classifications used in the current period. These reclassifications
had no impact on previously reported results.

Stock-Based Compensation 

On November 1, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) ( SFAS No.123R ),
 Share-Based Payment,  which addresses the accounting for stock-based payment transactions in
which an enterprise receives director and employee services in exchange for (a) equity
instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the
enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity
instruments. In January 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 107, which
provides supplemental implementation guidance for SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R eliminates the
ability to account for stock-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method
under Accounting Principles Board ( APB ) Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,  and instead generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a
fair-value-based method. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton ( BSM ) option-pricing model
to determine the fair-value of stock-based awards under SFAS No. 123R, consistent with that used
for pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.  The
Company has elected the modified prospective transition method permitted by SFAS No. 123R and,
accordingly, prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123R. The
modified prospective transition method requires that stock-based compensation expense be
recorded for all new and unvested stock options that are ultimately expected to vest as the
requisite service is rendered beginning on November 1, 2005, the first day of the Company s
fiscal year 2006. Stock-based compensation expense for awards granted prior to November 1, 2005
is based on the grant date fair-value as determined under the pro forma provisions of SFAS
No.123. The Company has recorded an incremental $110,000 of stock-based compensation expense
during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. In
accordance with SFAS No. 123R, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the Company has
presented excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock-based compensation awards as a
financing activity in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

The income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $21,000 for the quarter
ended January 31, 2006. As of January 31, 2006, $212,830 of total unrecognized compensation cost
related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.5
years. The total unrecognized stock option related compensation cost to be recognized in future
periods as of January 31, 2006 does not consider the effect of stock options that may be issued
in subsequent periods.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company measured compensation expense for its
employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB
Opinion No. 25. The Company applied the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS
No. 148,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure,  as if the
fair-value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. Under APB Opinion
No. 25, when the exercise price of the Company s employee stock options was equal to the market
price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense was recognized.

Table of Contents   

The following table illustrates the effect on net income after taxes and net income per common
share as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to
stock-based compensation during the three-month period ended January 31, 2005:

Further information regarding stock-based compensation can be found in Note 6 of these Notes
to Condensed Consolidated Financial statements.

Earnings Per Share 

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common
shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common
shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have
been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The
dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected in diluted earnings per share by
application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the
fair market value of the Company s common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from
outstanding options. For the three months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, outstanding
options totaled 1,161,000 and 1,711,000, respectively. Additionally, the exercise of employee
stock options can result in a greater dilutive effect on earnings per share.

Table of Contents   

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share based
on the requirements SFAS No. 128,  Earnings Per Share :

For the quarters ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, the diluted weighted-average shares
outstanding computation excludes 385,000 and 412,000 options, respectively, whose impact would
have an anti-dilutive effect.

NOTE 2   Inventories. 

Inventories consisted of the following at January 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005:

NOTE 3   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. 

The Company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with SFAS No. 142,
 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.  Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and certain intangible
assets are not amortized but are subject to an annual impairment test. At January 31, 2006 and
October 31, 2005 goodwill totaled $13,865,000 and $13,865,000, respectively. The following sets
forth the intangible assets, excluding goodwill, by major category:

Table of Contents   

Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over periods
ranging from one to seven years. During the three months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005,
aggregate amortization expense was approximately $108,000 and $176,000, respectively.

Amortization expense related to intangible assets at January 31, 2006 in each of the next five
fiscal years and beyond is expected to be as follows:

NOTE 4   Line of Credit Agreement. 

On July 6, 2004, the Company entered into a business loan agreement with Union Bank of
California, N.A., as the administrative agent, and two other lenders. The loan agreement is
comprised of a $20,000,000 term loan and a $35,000,000 revolving credit facility, which expires
on July 6, 2009 and is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the Company other
than the Company s real estate.

Under this loan agreement, interest on the $20,000,000 term loan is fixed at 5.4% for the term
of the loan. Interest on the revolving credit facility is charged at the bank s reference rate.
At January 31, 2006, the bank s reference rate was 7.75%. The loan agreement also provides for
optional interest rates based on London interbank offered rates ( LIBOR ) for periods of at
least 30 days in increments of $500,000. The credit facility also requires the payment of a
quarterly commitment fee based on a specified percentage rate
applied to the average amount for borrowings during the preceding quarter.

Table of Contents   

On September 3, 2004, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the loan agreement to
amend Section 6.12(a), Tangible Net Worth. The loan agreement, as amended, contains certain
financial covenants that include requirements that the Company maintain (1) a minimum tangible
net worth of $74,000,000 plus the net proceeds from any equity securities issued (including net
proceeds from stock option exercises) after the date of the loan agreement for the period ending
October 31, 2004, and a minimum tangible net worth of $74,000,000, plus 90% of net income after
taxes (without subtracting losses) earned in each quarterly accounting period commencing after
January 31, 2005, plus the net proceeds from any equity securities issued (including net
proceeds from stock option exercises) after the date of the loan agreement, (2) a minimum
earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) determined on a
rolling four quarters basis ranging from $16,500,000 at July 6, 2004 and increasing over time to
$27,000,000 at October 31, 2008 and thereafter, (3) a minimum ratio of cash and accounts
receivable to current liabilities of 0.75:1.00 for fiscal quarters ending January 31 and April
30 and 1.00:1.00 for fiscal quarters ending July 31 and October 31, and (4) a minimum fixed
charge coverage ratio of 1.10:1.00 at July 31, 2004 and 1.25:1.00 thereafter. The loan
agreement limits annual lease and rental expense associated with the Company s distribution
center in Oceanside, California as well as annual capital expenditures in any single fiscal year
on a consolidated basis in excess of certain amounts allowed for the acquisition of real
property and equipment in connection with the distribution center. The loan agreement has an
additional requirement where, for any period of 30 consecutive days, the total indebtedness
under the revolving credit facility may not be more than $15,000,000. The loan agreement also
limits the annual aggregate amount the Company may spend to acquire shares of its common stock.

On May 27, 2005 and September 8, 2005, the Company entered into the Second and Third Amendments,
respectively, to the Revolving/Term Loan Credit Agreement dated as of July 6, 2004, (as amended,
the  Credit Agreement ). The Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement amended section 6.12(e),
Capital Expenditures, to increase the spending limitation to acquire fixed assets from not more
than $5.0 million in any single fiscal year on a consolidated basis to a total of $20.0 million
for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 together, for the acquisition of real property and equipment in
connection with the distribution center located in Oceanside, California. The Third Amendment
to the Credit Agreement waived compliance with various sections of the Credit Agreement, solely
for the period ended July 31, 2005.

On January 26, 2006, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement to
amend several sections of the credit facility and to waive non-compliance with financial
covenants at October 31, 2005. Under the terms of the revised Credit Agreement, the revolving
loan commitment was adjusted to $42.5 million and the term loan commitment was adjusted to $6.8
million. Based on the revised Credit Agreement, the term loan shall commence January 31, 2006
and equal installments of principal in the amount of $125,000, plus all accrued interest, on
account of the term loan, with the entire unpaid principal balance and all accrued and unpaid
interest due in full on the maturity date of July 6, 2009.

Concurrent with the signing of the Fourth Amendment, the Company borrowed $7.5 million against
the revolving line of credit and paid down the term loan by the same amount. The Company also
paid bank fees totaling $125,000 related to the Fourth Amendment. The balance sheet at October
31, 2005 for the year ended October 31, 2005 included in the accompanying financial statements
was adjusted to record these transactions as if the Fourth Amendment had been in effect as of
October 31, 2005.

The Credit Agreement was also modified to reflect the change to a borrowing base commitment. The
primary requirements under the borrowing based denote that the Bank shall not be obligated to
advance funds under
the Revolving Loan at any time that the Company s aggregate obligations to the Bank exceed the
sum of (a) seventy-five percent (75%) of the Company s eligible accounts receivables, and (b)
fifty-five percent (55%) of the Company s eligible inventory. If at any time the Company s
obligations to the Bank under the referenced facilities exceed the permitted sum, the Company
shall immediately repay to the

9

Table of Contents   

Bank such excess. The applicable rate schedule was adjusted to
reflect an additional pricing tier based on the average daily funded debt to EBITDA ratio. The
Fourth Amendment also amended certain financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as follows:

1) 
       
     Minimum tangible net worth equal to the sum of $75 million; plus the sum of
90% of net income after income taxes (without subtracting losses) earned in each
quarterly accounting period commencing after January 31, 2006; plus, the net proceeds
from any equity securities issued after the date of the Fourth Amendment; 

2) 
       
     A ratio of quick assets to current liabilities (including the outstanding
amount of loans and letter of credit obligations) of at least .90:1:00, except for
the fiscal quarters ending January 31 and April 30, as to which the ratio of quick
assets to current liabilities shall be at least 0.75:1:00; 

3) 
       
     Capital expenditures are not to exceed more than $7 million in any fiscal
year; 

4) 
       
     Fixed charge coverage ratio as of the last day of any fiscal quarter is
required to be not less than 1.25 to 1:00; provided that, for the fiscal quarter
ended January 31, 2006, the fixed charge coverage ratio shall be not less than 0.80
to 1:00; and for purposes of determining the fixed charge coverage ratio only, the
Company s inventory write-down of $4,400,000 shall be added back to EBITDA for the
Company s fiscal quarter ending April 30, 2006 and the Company s maintenance capital
expenditures shall be $4,000,000 through the fiscal year ending October 31, 2006; and 

5) 
       
     The requirement where, for any period of 30 consecutive days, the total
indebtedness under the revolving credit facility may not be more than $15 million was
eliminated. 

At January 31, 2006, the Company s ratio of quick assets to current liabilities of 0.61:1:00 was
not in compliance with the required ratio of 0.75:1.00. On March 9, 2006, the Company obtained a
written waiver of the ratio of quick assets to current liabilities covenant requirement from its
lenders for the period ended January 31, 2006.

The line of credit under the Credit Agreement may also be used to finance commercial letters of
credit and standby letters of credit. Commercial letters of credit outstanding under the Credit
Agreement totaled $4.2 million at January 31, 2006 as compared to $4.0 million outstanding at
January 31, 2005. Including the effects of the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, the
Company had $23.1 million outstanding against the revolving credit facility as of January 31,
2006, compared to $8.3 million outstanding at January 31, 2005. Also including the effects of
the Fourth Amendment, the Company had $6.8 million outstanding on the term loan at January 31,
2006 compared to $18 million at January 31, 2005. At January 31, 2006, $10.9 million was
available for borrowing against the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement subject
to the borrowing base limitations.

NOTE 5   Issuance of Common Stock. 

Common stock and capital in excess of par value increased by $1,384,000 in the three months
ended
January 31, 2006, of which $1,121,000 is due to the issuance of 193,000 shares of common stock
on exercise of options and $153,000 is the tax benefit related to the exercise of those options.
The compensation expense for unvested options and options granted during the period, related
to implementation of SFAS No. 123R, was $110,000.

10

Table of Contents   

NOTE 6   Stock-Based Compensation. 

SFAS No. 123R requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock-based
awards. The Company has elected to use the BSM option-pricing model, which incorporates various
assumptions including volatility, expected life, interest rates and dividend yields. The
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock over the
most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company s stock options,
adjusted for the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur. The expected
life of an award is based on historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock
awards granted to employees and directors.

The assumptions used for the three-month periods ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 and the
resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during those
periods are as follows:

NOTE 7   Comprehensive Income. 

The Company includes the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment as well as the net
unrealized gains and loss on cash flow hedges as components of the comprehensive income in
addition to net income for the period. The following table sets forth the computation of
comprehensive income for the periods presented:

Table of Contents   

NOTE 8   Legal Proceedings. 

The Company is party to claims and litigation proceedings arising in the normal course of
business. Although the legal responsibility and financial impact with respect to such claims
and litigation cannot currently be ascertained, the Company does not believe that these matters
will result in payment by the Company of monetary damages, net of any applicable insurance
proceeds, that, in the aggregate, would be material in relation to the consolidated financial
position, liquidity or results of operations of the Company.

NOTE 9   Segment Information. 

The Company has the following four reportable segments: Domestic; Gekko Brands, LLC; Ashworth
U.K., Ltd.; and Other International. Management evaluates segment performance based primarily on
revenues and income from operations. Interest income and expense, unusual or infrequent items,
and income tax expense are evaluated on a consolidated basis and are not allocated to
the Company s business segments. For the period ended January 31, 2006, income (loss) from
operations for the Domestic segment included an increase in costs of Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and
legal and consulting costs related to the upcoming 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders that were
not allocated to other reportable segments. Segment information is summarized, for the periods or
dates presented, below:

NOTE 10   Contingencies 

During the quarter ended July 2005, the Company recalled certain knit styles of its Callaway
Golf apparel collection. The recalled styles contained magnets in the placket of the garment that
could cause a pacemaker or heart defibrillator to malfunction, potentially causing serious injury
or death to the wearer. To date, the Company has recovered approximately 80% of the recalled
product from its customers and end consumers. Additionally, the Company has not received any claims
to date and is unable to estimate the potential dollar amount of future claims, if any, at this
time.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

General 

The Company operates in an industry that is highly competitive and must accurately anticipate
fashion trends and consumer demand for its products. There are many factors that could cause
actual results to differ
materially from the projected results contained in certain forward-looking statements in this
report.

Because the Company s business is seasonal, the current balance sheet balances at January 31,
2006 may more meaningfully be compared to the balances at January 31, 2005, rather than to the
balances at October 31, 2005.

Critical Accounting Policies 

In response to the SEC s Release Numbers 33-8040,  Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure
About Critical Accounting Policies  and 33-8056,  Commission Statement About Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  the Company has
identified the following critical accounting policies that affect its more significant judgments
and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition.  Based on its terms of F.O.B. shipping point, where risk of loss and
title transfer to the buyer at the time of shipment, the Company recognizes revenue at the time
products are shipped or, for Company stores, at the point of sale. The Company records sales in
accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,  Revenue Recognition . Under these
guidelines, revenue is recognized when all of the following exist: persuasive evidence of a sale
arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and
payment is reasonably assured. Provisions are made in the period of the sale for estimated product
returns and sales allowances. The Company also includes payments from its customers for shipping
and handling in its net revenues line item in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF )

Sales Returns and Other Allowances.  Management must make estimates of potential future
product returns related to current period product revenues. The Company also makes payments and/or
grants credits to its customers as markdown (buydown) allowances and must make estimates of such
potential future allowances. Management analyzes historical returns and allowances, current
economic trends, changes in customer demand, and sell-through of the Company s products when
evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances. Significant management
judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and
other allowances in any accounting period. These markdown allowances are reported as a reduction
of the Company s net revenues. Material differences may result in the

amount and timing of the
Company s revenues for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different
estimates. The reserves for sales returns and other allowances amounted to $3.4 million at January
31, 2006 compared to $4.1 million at October 31, 2005 and $1.1 million at January 31, 2005. At
January 31, 2006 and during the year ended October 31, 2005 as compared to January 31, 2005, the
Company significantly increased the estimate for markdown allowances for its retail sales based on
recent experience in the retail channel.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.  Management must make estimates of the uncollectability of
accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments, which results in bad debt
expense. Management determines the adequacy of this allowance by analyzing current economic
conditions, historical bad debts and continually evaluating individual customer receivables
considering the customer s financial condition. If the financial condition of any significant
customers were to deteriorate, resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments,
material additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required. The Company maintains credit
insurance to cover many of its major accounts. The Company s trade accounts receivable balance was
$29.2 million, net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $1.3 million, at January 31, 2006, as
compared to the balance of $37.3 million, net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $1.2 million,
at October 31, 2005. At January 31,
2005, the trade accounts receivable balance was $30.5 million, net of allowances for doubtful
accounts of $1.3 million.

Inventory.  The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable
inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable
value based on assumptions about age of the inventory, future demand and market conditions. This
process provides for a new basis for the inventory until it is sold. If actual market conditions
are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be
required. The Company s inventory balance was $61.7 million, net of inventory write-downs of $3.8
million, at January 31, 2006, as compared to an inventory balance of $46.1 million, net of
inventory write-downs of $3.8 million, at October 31, 2005. At January 31, 2005, the inventory
balance was $59.2 million, net of inventory write-downs of $1.1 million.

Asset Purchase Credits.  In November 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with a third
party whereby prior seasons  slower selling inventory which was not damaged was exchanged for
future asset purchase credits ( APCs ), which may be utilized by the Company to purchase future
goods and services over a four-year period. The original value of the inventory exchanged (at
cost) was $1.4 million resulting in $1.4 million in future APCs. In December 2003, the Company
amended its agreement with the third party to exchange $0.9 million of additional prior seasons 
slower selling inventory (at cost) which was not damaged for an additional $0.9 million in future
APCs and an extension of the original November 2000 agreement through December 1, 2007. The
Company has entered into contracts with several third party suppliers who have agreed to accept
these APCs, in part, as payment for goods and services. The Company purchases products such as
sales fixtures, office and packaging supplies, as well as temporary help, freight and printing
services from such third party suppliers. From time to time, the Company may enter into additional
contracts with such third party suppliers to use the APCs. Management reviews and estimates the
likelihood of fully utilizing the APCs on a periodic basis. If the Company is unable to find
suppliers who agree to accept the APCs in quantities as projected by management, a write-down of
the value of the APCs may be required. At January 31, 2006, the Company had $22,000 of the APCs
remaining and management expects to fully utilize them over the remaining life of the contract
through December 1, 2007. At January 31, 2006, the Company has recorded $22,000 of the APCs in its
 Other Current Assets  line item. Since December 2003, the Company has not nor does it intend to
enter into any new contracts to exchange prior seasons  slower moving inventory for APCs.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

At January 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company did not have any relationships with unconsolidated
entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or
special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating
off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, the
Company does not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange trade contracts which rely on
estimation techniques to calculate fair value. As such, the Company is not exposed to any
financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if the Company had engaged in such
relationships.

Overview 

The Company earns revenues and income and generates cash through the design, marketing and
distribution of quality men s and women s sports apparel, headwear and accessories under the
Ashworth     , Callaway Golf apparel, Kudzu    and The Game    brands. The
Company s products are sold in the United States, Europe, Canada and various other international
markets to selected golf pro shops, resorts, off-course specialty shops, upscale department stores,
retail outlet stores, colleges and universities, entertainment complexes, sporting
goods dealers that serve high school and college markets, NASCAR/racing markets, outdoor
sports distribution channels and to top specialty-advertising firms for the corporate market.
Nearly all of the Company s production is through  full package  purchases of ready-made goods with
nearly all of the apparel and all of the headwear being manufactured in Asian countries. The
Company embroiders a majority of these garments with custom golf course, tournament, and collegiate
and corporate logos for its customers.

In May 2001, Ashworth agreed to a multi-year exclusive licensing agreement with Callaway Golf
Company to design, market and distribute complete lines of men s and women s Callaway Golf apparel.
The agreement allows Ashworth to sell Callaway Golf apparel primarily in the United States, Europe
and Canada. The initial Callaway Golf apparel products shipped in April 2002. The multi-year
agreement has various minimum annual requirements for marketing expenditures and royalty payments
based on the level of net revenues. The Company believes that revenues from the Callaway Golf
apparel product line will be sufficient to cover such minimum royalty payments. The agreement is
effective until December 31, 2010 and, at Ashworth s sole discretion, may be extended for one
five-year term provided that Ashworth meets or exceeds certain minimum requirements for calendar
years 2008 and 2009, that Ashworth gives notice of its intention to renew by January 1, 2010 and
that Ashworth is not in material breach of the agreement.

In July 2004, the Company completed the acquisition (the  Gekko Acquisition ) of all the
membership interests in Gekko Brands, LLC ( Gekko ), a leading designer, producer and distributor
of headwear and apparel under The Game and Kudzu brands. The purchase price for the acquisition
was $24 million, consisting of $23 million in cash and a $1 million promissory note with up to an
additional $6.5 million paid to the remaining members of Gekko management if the subsidiary
achieves certain defined earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) and other operating targets
over approximately three years or through Ashworth s fiscal year 2008. For the year ended October
31, 2005 and from the date of acquisition through October 31, 2004, the subsidiary achieved the
specified EBIT and other operating targets, entitling the remaining members of Gekko management to
additional payments of $1.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company placed into service its distribution
center in Oceanside, California and is currently integrating information systems and improving
operational processes.

The Company includes F.O.B. purchase price, inbound freight charges, duty, buying commissions
and overhead in its cost of goods sold line item. Overhead costs include purchasing and receiving
costs, inspection costs, warehousing costs, internal transfers costs and other costs associated
with the Company s distribution. The Company does not exclude any of these costs from cost of
goods sold.

Innovation . The Company continues to emphasize innovation and new products. Staying ahead of
the market and giving its customers new and better products enables the Company to remain strong in
very competitive market conditions.

The Ashworth product lines continue to evolve as the Company seeks to maintain its leadership
role in the golf industry. The EZ-TECH TM  products continue to be the industry standard
in 100% all cotton performance. EZ-TECH resists fading, pilling and shrinking and is now used in
bottoms, pullovers and polo shirts. EZ-TECH products are sold in all channels of distribution.

During 2005, the Company continued to develop its product lines and has recently released the
new Ashworth Weather Systems ( AWS ) Collection. AWS represent some of the most innovative
performance products in the industry, and is merchandised as a three layer performance system for
all climates and conditions. The introduction of AWS positions the Company to expand its market leadership position beyond
its traditional golf apparel offerings, meeting the increased performance demands of today s golf
apparel consumer.

The Callaway Golf apparel brand has grown in its diversity to include Sport and Collection
product for men as well as the recent introduction of Callaway Golf apparel for women. In addition,
the recently introduced X Series product line has had a complimentary global reception because of
its technical and moisture management characteristics.

The diversity of the Ashworth and Callaway Golf Apparel lines helps the Company maintain its
focus on multi-brand, multi-channel growth initiatives.

Preparing For Additional Growth.  The Company s embroidery and distribution center ( the
 EDC ) opened on November 1, 2004. Its operations in the first three quarters of fiscal 2005 were
not as efficient as originally planned primarily due to issues caused by the programming
requirements necessary to have the many varied systems work together. Management believes these
issues were largely resolved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and many of the expected
efficiencies are now being realized. The Company currently has sufficient capacity to accommodate
planned growth for the next few years. It also owns the adjoining seven acres which should
accommodate any future expansion requirements. In addition, the Company recently signed purchase
contracts for a new Enterprise Resource Planning ( ERP ) system to be installed over the next two
fiscal years. The current computer system was initially installed in 1993 and lacks the
sophistication required to efficiently operate a multi-currency, multi-subsidiary business. The
new ERP system is expected to provide management with timely, consolidated information to gain
better visibility into the Company s business drivers.

Results of Operations 

First quarter 2006 compared to First quarter 2005  

Consolidated net revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 increased 11.2% to $40.6
million from $36.5 million for the same period in fiscal 2005. The increase was driven by higher
revenues from the Company s retail and corporate distribution channels and outlet stores as well as
higher revenues from Gekko and international segments. The increases were partially offset by
lower net revenues from the green grass distribution channels.

17

Table of Contents   

Net revenues for the domestic segment increased 10.0% to $34.8 million for the first quarter
of fiscal 2006 from $31.6 million for the same period in fiscal 2005. Net revenues from the
Company s retail distribution channel increased 40.9% or $1.5 million primarily driven by an
improved product mix with the addition of classic key items. Net revenues from the corporate
distribution channel increased 34.8% or $1.4 million primarily due to the addition of the Callaway
Golf apparel line as well as a focus on outerwear. Gekko revenues increased 16.8% or $1.4 million
primarily in its collegiate and outdoors distribution channels. Net revenues from the Company owned
stores increased 36.2% or $0.6 million primarily due to the net addition of three stores. These
increases were partially offset by the 12.8% or $1.7 million decrease in revenues from the
Company s green grass distribution channel. This decrease was primarily due to lower volume
realized as the Company reduced the volume discounts offered to its customers.

Net revenues for the Company s U.K. subsidiary increased 31.1% to $4.5 million for the first
quarter of fiscal 2006 from $3.4 million for the same period in fiscal 2005. Each brand contributed
equally to the $1.1 million increase in revenues. Net revenues for the Company s other
international segment decreased 7.7% to $1.4 million for the current quarter from $1.5 million for
the same period of the prior fiscal year.

Consolidated gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 increased 420 basis points to
44.3% as compared to 40.1% for the same period in fiscal 2005. This improvement was primarily due
to improved direct labor efficiencies in the EDC and fewer volume discounts offered to its
customers.

Consolidated selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses increased 25.6% to $17.7
million for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 from $14.1 million for the same period in fiscal 2005.
As a percent of net revenues, SG A expenses were 43.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 as
compared to 38.6% for the same period in fiscal 2005. The increase in SG A is primarily due to
higher sales related expenses, such as royalties, commissions and expenses related to the opening
of new Company owned stores, as well as increased audit and consulting fees related to
Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and legal fees related to the upcoming 2006 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders.

Total other expense decreased to $361,000 for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 from $406,000
for the same period of fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily due to higher interest expense
resulting from increased long-term debt offset by higher currency transaction gains in the current
quarter as compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year at the Company s U.K. subsidiary
and Canadian divisions.

The effective income tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 remained unchanged from the
same period of fiscal 2005 at 40.0% of pre-tax income.

Capital Resources and Liquidity 

The Company s primary sources of liquidity for the next 12 months are expected to be its cash
flows from operations, the working capital line of credit with its bank and other financial
alternatives such as leasing. The Company requires cash for capital expenditures and other
requirements associated with the expansion of its domestic and international production,
distribution and sales, as well as for general working capital purposes. The Company s need for
working capital is seasonal, with the greatest requirements existing from approximately December
through the end of July each year. The Company typically builds up its inventory during this
period to provide product for shipment for the spring/summer selling season.

On July 6, 2004, the Company entered into a business loan agreement with Union Bank of
California, N.A., as the administrative agent, and two other lenders. The loan agreement is
comprised of a $20.0 million term loan and a $35.0 million revolving credit facility, which expires
on July 6, 2009 and is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the Company other than
the Company s real estate.

18

Table of Contents   

Under this loan agreement, interest on the $20.0 million term loan is fixed at 5.4% for the
term of the loan. Interest on the revolving credit facility is charged at the bank s reference
rate. At January 31, 2006, the bank s reference rate was 7.75%. The loan agreement also provides
for optional interest rates based on London interbank offered rates ( LIBOR ) for periods of at
least 30 days in increments of $0.5 million.

On September 3, 2004, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the loan agreement to
amend Section 6.12(a), Tangible Net Worth. The loan agreement, as amended, contains certain
financial covenants that include requirements that the Company maintain (1) a minimum tangible net
worth of $74.0 million plus the net proceeds from any equity securities issued (including net
proceeds from stock option exercises) after the date of the loan agreement for the period ending
October 31, 2004, and a minimum tangible net worth of $74.0 million, plus 90% of net income after
taxes (without subtracting losses) earned in each quarterly accounting period commencing after
January 31, 2005, plus the net proceeds from any equity securities issued (including net proceeds
from stock option exercises) after the date of the loan agreement, (2) a minimum earnings before
interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) determined on a rolling four
quarters basis ranging from $16.5 million at July 6, 2004 and increasing over time to $27.0 million
at October 31, 2008 and thereafter, (3) a minimum ratio of cash and accounts receivable to current
liabilities of 0.75:1.00 for fiscal quarters ending January 31 and April 30 and 1.00:1.00 for
fiscal quarters ending July 31 and October 31, and (4) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of
1.10:1.00 at July 31, 2004 and 1.25:1.00 thereafter. The loan agreement limits annual lease and
rental expense associated with the Company s distribution center in Oceanside, California as well
as annual capital expenditures in any single fiscal year on a consolidated basis in excess of
certain amounts allowed for the acquisition of real property and equipment in connection with the
distribution center. The loan agreement has an additional requirement where, for any period of 30
consecutive days, the total indebtedness under the revolving credit facility may not be more than
$15.0 million. The loan agreement also limits the annual aggregate amount the Company may spend to
acquire shares of its common stock.

On May 27, 2005 and September 8, 2005, the Company entered into the Second and Third
Amendments, respectively, to the Revolving/Term Loan Credit Agreement dated as of July 6, 2004, (as
amended, the  Credit Agreement ). The Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement amended section
6.12(e), Capital Expenditures, to increase the spending limitation to acquire fixed assets from not
more than $5.0 million in any single fiscal year on a consolidated basis to a total of $20.0
million for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 together, for the acquisition of real property and equipment
in connection with the distribution center located in Oceanside, California. The Third Amendment
to the Credit Agreement waived compliance with various sections of the Credit Agreement, solely for
the period ended July 31, 2005.

On January 26, 2006, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement to
amend several sections of the credit facility and to waive non-compliance with financial covenants
at October 31, 2005. Under the terms of the revised Credit Agreement, the revolving loan commitment
was adjusted to $42.5 million and the term loan commitment was adjusted to $6.8 million. Based on
the revised Credit Agreement, the term loan shall commence January 31, 2006 and equal monthly
installments of principal in the amount of $125,000, plus all accrued interest, on account of the
term loan, with the entire unpaid principal balance and all accrued and unpaid interest due in full
on the maturity date of July 6, 2009.

Concurrent with the signing of the Fourth Amendment, the Company borrowed $7.5 million against
the revolving line of credit and paid down the term loan by the same amount. The Company also paid
bank fees totaling $125,000 related to the Fourth Amendment. The balance sheet at October 31, 2005
for the year ended October 31, 2005 included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements was adjusted to record these transactions as if the Fourth Amendment had been in effect
as of October 31, 2005.

19

Table of Contents   

The Credit Agreement was also modified to reflect the change to a borrowing base commitment.
The primary requirements under the borrowing based denote that the Bank shall not be obligated to
advance funds under the Revolving Loan at any time that the Company s aggregate obligations to the
Bank exceed the sum of (a) seventy-five percent (75%) of the Company s eligible accounts
receivables, and (b) fifty-five percent (55%) of the Company s eligible inventory. If at any time
the Company s obligations to the Bank under the referenced facilities exceed the permitted sum, the
Company shall immediately repay to the Bank such excess. The applicable rate schedule was adjusted
to reflect an additional pricing tier based on the average daily funded debt to EBITDA ratio. The
Fourth Amendment also amended certain financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as follows:

1) 
       
     Minimum tangible net worth equal to the sum of $75 million; plus the sum of
90% of net income after income taxes (without subtracting losses) earned in each
quarterly accounting period commencing after January 31, 2006; plus, the net proceeds
from any equity securities issued after
the date of the Fourth Amendment; 

2) 
       
     A ratio of quick assets to current liabilities (including the outstanding
amount of loans and letter of credit obligations) of at least .90:1:00, except for
the fiscal quarters ending January 31 and April 30, as to which the ratio of quick
assets to current liabilities shall be at least 0.75:1:00; 

3) 
       
     Capital expenditures are not to exceed more than $7 million in any fiscal
year; 

4) 
       
     Fixed charge coverage ratio as of the last day of any fiscal quarter is
required to be not less than 1.25 to 1:00; provided that, for the fiscal quarter
ended January 31, 2006, the fixed charge coverage ratio shall be not less than 0.80
to 1:00; and for purposes of determining the fixed charge coverage ratio only, the
Company s inventory write-down of $4,400,000 shall be added back to EBITDA for the
Company s fiscal quarter ending April 30, 2006 and the Company s maintenance capital
expenditures shall be $4,000,000 through the fiscal year ending October 31, 2006; and 

5) 
       
     The requirement where, for any period of 30 consecutive days, the total
indebtedness under the revolving credit facility may not be more than $15 million was
eliminated. 

At January 31, 2006, the Company s ratio of quick assets to current liabilities of 0.61:1:00
was not in compliance with the required ratio of 0.75:1.00. On March 8, 2006, the Company obtained
a written waiver of the ratio of quick assets to current liabilities covenant requirement from its
lenders for the period ended January 31, 2006.

The line of credit under the loan agreement may also be used to finance commercial letters of
credit and standby letters of credit. Commercial letters of credit outstanding under this loan
agreement totaled $4.2 million at January 31, 2006 as compared to $4.0 million outstanding at
January 31, 2005 under the prior loan agreement. The Company had $23.1 million outstanding against
the revolving credit facility under this loan agreement at January 31, 2006, compared to $8.3
million outstanding at January 31, 2005 under the prior agreement. The increase in outstanding
letters of credit is primarily due to the continued conversion of vendors from letters of credit to
open credit terms. The increase in borrowings against the revolving credit facility is primarily
due to the $7.5 million transfer from the term loan to the line of credit as well as financing of
the operating cash flow needs. The Company had $6.8 million outstanding on the term loan under
this loan agreement at January 31, 2006 compared to $7.5 million at October 31, 2005. At January
31, 2006, $10.9 million was available for borrowings against the revolving credit facility under
this loan agreement.

During the three months ended January 31, 2006, cash used in operations was $3.8 million as
compared to $4.4 million used in operations during the same period of the prior fiscal year. The
decrease in cash used in operations was primarily due to a decrease in current assets.

Net trade receivables were $29.2 million at January 31, 2006, a decrease of $8.1 million from
the balance at October 31, 2005. Because the Company s business is seasonal, the net receivables
balance may more meaningfully be compared to the balance of $30.5 million at January 31, 2005,
rather than the year-end balance. The comparison of the first quarter fiscal 2006 balance to the
first quarter fiscal 2005 balance shows a decrease of approximately $1.3 million, primarily due to
more timely collections.

Net inventories increased 33.8% to $61.7 million at January 31, 2006 from $46.1 million at
October 31, 2005, primarily due to the seasonal nature of the Company s golf distribution channel
and the Company s inventory requirements to meet market demand in the spring/summer selling season.
Compared to
net inventories of $59.2 million at January 31, 2005, net inventories at January 31, 2006 have
increased by 4.2%, primarily due to the addition of collegiate apparel product line at Gekko. The
Company believes that its current inventory mix is appropriate to respond to anticipated market
demand.

Current liabilities increased 15.0% to $49.1 million at January 31, 2006 from $42.7 million at
October 31, 2005. Compared to current liabilities of $32.9 million at January 31, 2005, current
liabilities increased 49.1%, primarily due to the reclassification of $7.5 million from the long
term note payable to the line of credit payable as well as an increase borrowings against the line
of credit of $7.4 million to fund working capital requirements.

On April 2, 2004, the Company completed the purchase of the distribution center for
approximately $14.0 million and entered into a secured loan agreement with a bank to finance $11.7
million of the purchase price. The loan is at a fixed interest rate of 5.0% and will be amortized
over 30 years, but is due and payable on May 1, 2014. To fulfill certain requirements under the
mortgage loan agreement, the Company created Ashworth EDC LLC, a special purpose entity, to be the
purchaser and mortgagor. Ashworth EDC LLC is a wholly owned limited liability company organized
under the laws of the State of Delaware and its results and assets are reported in the condensed
consolidated statements included in this report.

During the first three months of fiscal 2006, the Company incurred capital expenditures of
$0.6 million, primarily for computer systems, equipment, and new outlet stores leasehold
improvements and equipment. The Company anticipates capital spending of approximately $5.2 million
during the remainder of fiscal 2006, primarily on computer systems and equipment, outlet store
openings, and distribution center related equipment. Management currently intends to finance the
purchase of the additional capital equipment from the Company s cash resources, but may use leases
or equipment financing agreements if deemed appropriate.

On August 30, 2004, the Company agreed to a schedule with Key Equipment Finance, a Division of
Key Corporate Capital, Inc. ( KEF ), thereby completing the Master Equipment Lease Agreement, dated
as of June 23, 2003, previously entered into by Ashworth and KEF. Under the terms of the schedule,
we will be leasing equipment for our distribution center in Oceanside, California. The aggregate
cost of the equipment is approximately $10.4 million. The initial term of the lease is for
ninety-one (91) months beginning on September 1, 2004 and the monthly rent payment is $128,800. At
the end of the initial term, the Company will have the option to (1) purchase all, but not less
than all, equipment on the initial term expiration date at a price

21

Table of Contents   

equal to the greater of (a) the
then fair market sale value thereof, or (b) 12% of the total cost of the equipment (plus, in each
case, applicable sales taxes), (2) renew the lease on a month-to-month basis at the same rent
payable at the expiration of the initial lease term, (3) renew the lease for a minimum period of
not less than 12 consecutive months at the then current fair market rental value, or (4) return
such equipment to KEF pursuant to, and in the condition required by, the lease.

The Company is party to an exclusive licensing agreement with Callaway Golf Company, which
requires certain minimum royalty payments which began in January 2003. The agreement is effective
until December 31, 2010 and, at Ashworth s sole discretion, may be extended for a five-year term
provided that Ashworth meets or exceeds certain minimum requirements for calendar years 2008 and
2009, that Ashworth gives notice of its intention to renew by January 1, 2010 and that Ashworth is
not in material breach of the agreement. The revenues from the Callaway Golf apparel product line
have been, and the Company believes will continue to be, sufficient to cover such minimum
guarantees.

Common stock and capital in excess of par value increased by $1,384,000 in the three months
ended January 31, 2006, of which $1,121,000 is due to the issuance of 193,000 shares of common
stock on exercise of
options and $153,000 is the tax benefit related to the exercise of those options. The
compensation expense for unvested options and options granted during the period, related to
implementation of SFAS No. 123R, was $110,000.

Based on current levels of operations, the Company expects that sufficient cash flow will be
generated from operations so that, combined with other financing alternatives available, including
cash on hand, borrowings under its bank credit facility and leasing alternatives, the Company will
be able to meet all of its debt service, capital expenditure and working capital requirements for
at least the next 12 months.

Derivatives 

From time to time the Company enters into short-term foreign exchange contracts with its bank
to hedge against the impact of currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the British pound
and the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. The contracts provide that, on specified dates, the
Company will sell the bank a specified number of British pounds or Canadian dollars in exchange for
a specified number of U.S. dollars. Additionally, from time to time the Company s U.K. subsidiary
enters into similar contracts with its bank to hedge against currency fluctuations between the
British pound and the U.S. dollar and the British pound and other European currencies. Realized
gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in operations in the same period as the hedged
transactions. These contracts have maturity dates that do not normally exceed 12 months. During
the quarter ended January 31, 2006, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries had any
outstanding foreign exchange contracts.

New Accounting Standards 

In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 154,
 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections   a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement
No. 3  ( SFAS No. 154 ). SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods 
financial statements for changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine
either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 also
requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the
direct effects of the change. Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle, such as a
change in non-discretionary profit-sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be
recognized in the period of the accounting change. SFAS No. 154 also requires that a change in

22

Table of Contents   

depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long-lived non-financial assets be accounted
for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors
made in fiscal years beginning after the date this statement was issued. The Company s adoption of
SFAS No. 154 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s financial position or
results of operations

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,  Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment
of APB Opinion No. 29  ( SFAS No.153 ). The guidance in APB Opinion No. 29,  Accounting for
Nonmonetary Transactions  ( APB Opinion No. 29 ), is based on the principle that exchanges of
nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of assets exchanged. The guidance in
APB Opinion No. 29, however, included certain exceptions to that principle. SFAS No. 153 amends
APB Opinion No. 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive
assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if
the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the
exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods
beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company s adoption of SFAS No. 153 did not have a significant
effect on
its financial statements.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,  Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4  ( SFAS No. 151 ) .  This Statement amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,  Inventory
Pricing  ( ARB No. 43 ), to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). Paragraph 5 of ARB No. 43, previously
stated that  ...under some circumstances, items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage,
double freight, and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period
charges....  SFAS No. 151 requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges
regardless of whether they meet the criterion of  so abnormal.  In addition, this statement
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the
normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of SFAS 151 shall be applied
prospectively and are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2005, with earlier application permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years
beginning after the date this Statement is issued. The Company s adoption of SFAS No. 151 did
not have a significant effect on its financial statements.

Cautionary Statements 

This report contains certain forward-looking statements related to the Company s market
position, finances, operating results, marketing and business plans and strategies within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to update
any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, changed circumstances or
unanticipated events unless required by law. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that
could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include the
identification and evaluation of strategic alternatives, the actual or threatened proxy
solicitation by third parties, timely development and acceptance of new products, as well as
strategic alliances, the integration of the Company s acquisition of Gekko Brands LLC, the impact
of competitive products and pricing, the success of the Callaway Golf apparel product line, the
preliminary nature of bookings information, the ongoing risk of excess or obsolete inventory, the
potential inadequacy of booked reserves, the successful operation of the new distribution facility
in Oceanside, CA and other risks described in Ashworth, Inc. s SEC reports, including the annual
report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2005, other quarterly reports on Form

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Interest Rate Risk 

The Company s debt consists of a term loan, mortgage note, notes payable and a capital lease
that had a total balance of $18.6 million at January 31, 2006. The debt bears interest at fixed
rates ranging from 3.5% to 5.4%, which approximates fair value based on current rates offered for
debt with similar risks and maturities. The Company also had $23.1 million outstanding at January
31, 2006 on its revolving line of credit with interest charged at a weighted average rate of 6.62%.
Under the Credit Agreement, borrowings against the revolving line of credit are charged interest at
the bank s reference rate (prime) or, at the Company s option, at an optional interest rate based
on LIBOR in increments of $0.5 million for periods of at least 30 days. At January 31, 2006, the
bank s reference rate was 7.75%. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates during the three
months ended January 31, 2006 would have resulted in a $32,000 decrease in net income.

For details regarding the Company s variable and fixed rate debt, see  Item 2. Management
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Capital Resources and
Liquidity .

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 

The Company s ability to sell its products in foreign markets and the U.S. dollar value of the
sales made in foreign currencies can be significantly influenced by foreign currency fluctuations.
A decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could result in downward
price pressure for the Company s products or losses from currency exchange rates. From time to
time the Company enters into short-term foreign exchange contracts with its bank to hedge against
the impact of currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the British pound and the U.S.
dollar and the Canadian dollar. The contracts provide that, on specified dates, the Company will
sell the bank a specified number of British pounds or Canadian dollars in exchange for a specified
number of U.S. dollars. Additionally, from time to time the Company s U.K. subsidiary enters into
similar contracts with its bank to hedge against currency fluctuations between the British pound
and the U.S. dollar and the British pound and other European currencies. Realized gains and losses
on these contracts are recognized in the same period as the hedged transaction. These contracts
have maturity dates that do not normally exceed 12 months. The Company will continue to assess the
benefits and risks of strategies to manage the risks presented by currency exchange rate
fluctuations. There is no assurance that any strategy will be successful in avoiding losses due to
exchange rate fluctuations, or that the failure to manage currency risks effectively would not have
a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations. During the quarter ended January
31, 2006, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries had any outstanding foreign exchange
contracts.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the reports we file pursuant to the Exchange Act are recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
our management, including our Chief

24

Table of Contents   

Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO )
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and
evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide a reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance,
management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures.

We carried out this evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 2006. Based on that evaluation and our
evaluation as of October 31, 2005 included in our Form 10-K filed on February 1, 2006, our CEO and
CFO concluded that, as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial
reporting discussed in Item 9A. Controls And Procedures of our Form 10-K for the period ended
October 31, 2005, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of January 31, 2006

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

During the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2006, management has begun to take corrective
action to
remediate the material weaknesses identified in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. This
includes the addition of qualified accounting, finance and tax personnel on a permanent and
consulting basis in addition to the installation of software that allows management to monitor and
audit modifications and changes to the ERP system by users with super-users access rights. To
date, neither the Company nor its registered independent public accountants have performed any
procedures to attest to the effectiveness of these corrective actions. However, such procedures are
expected to be performed prior to the end of the current fiscal year. Except for the corrective
actions denoted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to material affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

We currently are unable to determine when the material weaknesses identified in our most
recent Annual Report on Form 10-K will be fully remediated. However, because remediation will not
be completed until we have completed staffing changes and strengthened the pertinent controls, we
believe that the material weaknesses continued to exist at January 31, 2006.

PART II 

OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

The Company is party to claims and litigation proceedings arising in the normal course of
business. Although the legal responsibility and financial impact with respect to such other claims
and litigation cannot currently be ascertained, the Company does not believe that these matters
will result in payment by the Company of monetary damages, net of any applicable insurance
proceeds, that, in the aggregate, would be material in relation to the consolidated financial
position or results of operations of the Company.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

The following discussion is an update to the  Risk Factors  discussed in the Company s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2005; the risk factors contained therein are
still considered current and should be given equal consideration together with the matters
discussed below:

The Company received a notice from Knightspoint Partners II, LLC
( Knightspoint ) dated December 22, 2005 indicating that Knightspoint intends to
present a number of proposals at the Company s Annual Meeting in 2006. On February 27,
2006, Knightspoint filed a preliminary proxy statement with the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with certain proposals and director
nominations Knightspoint intends to make at the Company s Annual Meeting in 2006.
The Company is currently evaluating the proposals in the Knightspoint filing. If
the Company were to oppose the Knightspoint proposals as not in the Company s or
stockholders  best interest, management would be forced to expend substantial time and
energy which may divert management s attention from the operations of the Company, as
well as incur significant additional costs, including fees for the retention of legal
and financial advisors, that would negatively impact the Company s operating results
and financial condition. At this time, management can not estimate the impact that
such proposals will have on the Company s operating results and financial condition.
