NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Unaudited) 

1.  
       
      Basis of Presentation  

The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2006, the condensed consolidated
statements of income and comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2006
and 2005, and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended
January 31, 2006 and 2005 have been prepared by the Company, without audit. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present
fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows at January 31, 2006 and for all
periods presented have been made. 

H R Block,   the Company,   we,   our  and  us  are used interchangeably to refer to H R
Block, Inc. or to H R Block, Inc. and its subsidiaries, as appropriate to the context.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year
presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on our results of operations or stockholders 
equity as previously reported. Adjustments related to the restatements of previously issued
financial statements are detailed in note 2.

On June 8, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split of the Company s
Common Stock in the form of a 100% stock distribution, effective August 22, 2005, to shareholders
of record as of the close of business on August 1, 2005. All share and per share amounts in this
document have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the stock split.

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been
condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in our April 30, 2005 Annual
Report to Shareholders on Form 10-K/A.

Operating revenues of the Tax Services and Business Services segments are seasonal in nature
with peak revenues occurring in the months of January through April. Therefore, results for interim
periods are not indicative of results to be expected for the full year.

2.  
       
      Restatements of Previously Issued Financial Statements  

(A)  On February 22, 2006, management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors concluded to restate
previously issued consolidated financial statements for the fiscal quarters ended October 31, 2005
and July 31, 2005, the fiscal years ended April 30, 2005 and 2004 and the related fiscal quarters.
We arrived at this conclusion during the course of our closing process for the quarter ended
January 31, 2006. This restatement pertains primarily to errors in determining the Company s state
effective income tax rate, including errors in identifying changes in state apportionment, expiring
state net operating losses and related factors. These errors resulted in an understatement of
income tax expense (net of federal income tax benefit) of approximately $2.0 million and $0.2
million for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2005, respectively, an overstatement of
deferred income tax assets of $1.2 million as of April 30, 2005 and an understatement of accrued
income taxes of approximately $25.9 million as of April 30,
2005. The effect of the above
adjustments on the condensed consolidated financial statements is set
forth in  2C  below. 

Income tax expense for the three
months ended January 31, 2006 includes $3.4 million related
to the correction of errors in state income taxes relating to periods
prior to May 1, 2003. These errors were determined to be
immaterial to both the current fiscal year and
the applicable prior period results.  

(B)  On June 7, 2005, management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors determined
that restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements, including financial
statements for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2005, was appropriate as a result of the
errors noted below. All amounts listed are pretax, unless otherwise noted.

An error in calculating the gain on sale of residual interests in fiscal year 2003. This
error was corrected by deferring a portion of the gain on sale of residual interests as of the
transaction date in fiscal year 2003 and recognizing revenue from the sale as interest income
from accretion of residual interests in subsequent periods. Interest income from accretion
increased $3.9 million 

-4-

Table of Contents   

and $9.6 million for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2005, respectively. This
correction also decreased impairments of residual interests $0.3 million and $1.1 million for the
three and nine months ended January 31, 2005, respectively, and decreased comprehensive income
$2.6 million and $6.7 million for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2005, respectively. 

An error in the calculation of an incentive compensation accrual at our Mortgage Services
segment as of April 30, 2004. This error resulted in an overstatement of compensation expense
for the nine months ended January 31, 2005 of $12.1 million. 

An error in accounting for leased properties related to rent holidays and mandatory rent
escalation in our Tax Services, Mortgage Services and Investment Services segments. Rent
expense was understated for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2005 by $1.2 million
and $1.8 million, respectively. 

An error from the capitalization of certain branch office costs at our Investment Services
segment, which should have been expensed as incurred. This error resulted in an understatement
of occupancy expenses and an overstatement of depreciation expense and capital expenditures,
resulting in a net overstatement of operating expenses of $0.4 million and $5.9 million for
the three and nine months ended January 31, 2005, respectively. 

Errors related to accounting for acquisitions at our Business Services and Investment
Services segments, the largest of which was the acquisition of OLDE in fiscal year 2000.
Amortization of customer relationships was understated by $1.8 million and $5.5 million for
the three and nine months ended January 31, 2005, respectively, and the provision for income
taxes was overstated by approximately $3.7 million and $11.2 million, respectively, related to
this error. 

The effect of the above
adjustments on the condensed consolidated financial statements is set
forth in  2C  below. 

( C)  Notes 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13 and 15 have been restated to reflect the above described
adjustments. The following is a summary of the impact of the restatements on our condensed
consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended
January 31, 2005:

The restatements had no impact on our cash flows from financing activities as
previously reported.

3.  
       
      Business Combinations  

Effective October 1, 2005, we acquired all outstanding common stock of American Express Tax and
Business Services, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of $191.7 million, subject to a
post-closing adjustment based upon determination of the final September 30, 2005 net asset value.
During the three months ended January 31, 2006, we completed the final valuation of intangible
assets. Results related to American Express Tax and Business Services, Inc. have been included in
our condensed consolidated financial statements since October 1, 2005. Pro forma results of
operations have not been presented because the effects of this acquisition were not material to our
results. The accompanying balance sheet reflects a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to
assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows: 

-6-

Table of Contents   

Goodwill recognized in these transactions is included in the Business Services
segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. The preliminary purchase price allocations are
subject to change and will be adjusted based upon resolution of several matters including, but not
limited to, the following:

Determination of the post-closing adjustment and final purchase price; 

Determination of final liabilities relating to planned exit activities; and 

Determination of the tax basis of acquired assets and liabilities, and deferred tax
balances of the acquired business. 

4.  
       
      Earnings (Loss) Per Share  

Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average shares outstanding during
each period. The dilutive effect of potential common shares is included in diluted earnings (loss)
per share except in those periods with a loss. The computations of basic and diluted earnings
(loss) per share are as follows: 

Diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of shares of common stock issuable
upon the lapse of certain restrictions or the exercise of options to purchase 29.3 million shares
of stock for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 as the effect would be antidilutive due to the
net loss recorded during the period. Diluted earnings per share for the three months ended January
31, 2006 and the three and nine months ended January 31, 2005 excludes the impact of 7.1 million,
0.7 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, issuable upon the exercise of stock options, as
the effect would be antidilutive due to the options  exercise prices being greater than the average
market price of the common shares during the period.

The weighted average shares outstanding for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2006
decreased to 327.3 million and 328.0 million, respectively, from 329.0 million and 331.9 million
last year, primarily due to our purchases of treasury shares. The effect of these purchases was
partially offset by the issuance of treasury shares related to our stock-based compensation plans.

During each of the nine month periods ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, we issued 6.3 million
and 6.5 million shares of common stock, respectively, pursuant to the exercise of stock options,
employee stock purchases and awards of restricted shares, in accordance with our stock-based
compensation plans.

During the nine months ended January 31, 2006, we acquired 9.2 million shares of our common
stock, of which 9.0 million shares were purchased from third parties with the remaining shares
swapped or surrendered to us, at an aggregate cost of $260.1 million. During the nine months ended

January 31, 2005, we acquired 22.6 million shares of our common stock, of which 22.5 million were
purchased from third parties, at an aggregate cost of $529.9 million.

5.  
       
      Receivables  

Receivables consist of the following: 

6.  
       
      Mortgage Banking Activities  

Activity related to available-for-sale residual interests in securitizations consists of the following: 

We sold $32.3 billion and $21.7 billion of mortgage loans in loan sales to warehouse
trusts (Trusts) or other buyers during the nine months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, with gains totaling $450.2 million and $544.4 million, respectively, recorded on
these sales.

Net additions to trading residual interests recorded in connection with the securitization of
mortgage loans totaled $228.6 million and $115.2 million during the nine months ended January 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively. Trading residuals valued at $234.5 million were securitized in net
interest margin (NIM) transactions during the current year, with net cash proceeds of $195.2
million received in connection with NIM transactions. In the prior year, trading residuals valued
at $115.2 million were securitized with net cash proceeds of $98.7 million received on the
transactions. Total net additions to residual interests from NIM transactions for the nine months
ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 were $39.4 million and $16.5 million, respectively.

During the nine months ended January 31, 2006, we completed the sale of $40.5 million of
previously securitized residual interests and recorded a gain of $28.7 million. We received cash
proceeds of $30.5 million and retained a $10.0 million residual interest in the sale. This sale
accelerates cash flows from the residual interests and recognition of unrealized gains included in
other comprehensive income.

Although we recorded residual interests classified as trading securities during the nine
months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, at the end of each quarter we had no trading residual
interests outstanding. Trading residual interests are the result of the initial securitization of
mortgage loans

-8-

Table of Contents   

and are subsequently securitized in a NIM transaction. Mark-to-market adjustments on trading
residuals are included in gains on sales of mortgage assets on the condensed consolidated income
statement. Such adjustments resulted in a net loss of $1.4 million and a net gain of $0.6 million
for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2006, respectively. Similar adjustments resulted in
a net gain of $0.4 million and $5.4 million for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2005,
respectively. Cash flows from trading residuals of $12.9 million were received for the nine months
ended January 31, 2006 and are included in operating activities in the accompanying condensed
consolidated statement of cash flows. Accretion of trading residuals totaled $3.5 million and $5.9
million for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2006, respectively, and zero in the prior
year periods. There were no trading residuals recorded as of April 30, 2005.

Cash flows from available-for-sale residual interests of $74.9 million and $100.3 million were
received from the securitization trusts for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. Cash received on available-for-sale residual interests is included in
investing activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

Aggregate net unrealized gains on residual interests not yet accreted into income totaled
$63.0 million at January 31, 2006 and $115.4 million at April 30, 2005. These unrealized gains are
recorded net of deferred taxes in other comprehensive income, and may be recognized in income in
future periods either through accretion or upon further securitization or sale of the related
residual interest.

Activity related to mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) consists of the following:

Additions to MSRs during fiscal year 2006 have increased primarily as a result of
higher origination volumes, higher average loan balances and higher interest rates. In
addition, during fiscal year 2006 we updated our assumptions used to value MSRs. The assumptions
were updated primarily to reflect lower servicing costs, in particular interest paid to bondholders
on monthly loan prepayments, and higher discount rates. These changes in assumptions increased the
weighted average value of MSRs recorded during the second and third quarters by approximately $17.0
million (0.14% of loans originated) and $10.0 million (0.11% of loans originated), respectively,
over the prior year. Estimated amortization of MSRs for fiscal years 2006 through 2010 is $140.5
million, $123.9 million, $61.0 million, $25.3 million and $11.8 million, respectively.

The key weighted average assumptions we used to estimate the cash flows and values of the
residual interests initially recorded during the nine months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 are as
follows:

The key weighted average assumptions we used to estimate the cash flows and values
of the residual interests and MSRs at January 31, 2006 and April 30, 2005 are as follows:

-9-

Table of Contents   

We originate both adjustable and fixed rate mortgage loans. A key assumption used to
estimate the cash flows and values of the residual interests and MSRs is average annualized
prepayment speeds. Prepayment speeds include voluntary prepayments, involuntary prepayments and
scheduled principal payments. Prepayment rate assumptions are as follows:

Prior to 

Months Outstanding After 

Initial Rate

     %

     % 

For fixed rate mortgages without prepayment penalties, we use an average prepayment
rate of 32% over the life of the loans. Prepayment rate is projected based on actual paydown
including voluntary, involuntary and scheduled principal payments.

Expected static pool credit losses are as follows:

Static pool credit losses are calculated by summing the actual and projected future
credit losses and dividing them by the original balance of each pool of assets.

At January 31, 2006, the sensitivities of the current fair value of the
residual interests and MSRs to 10% and 20% adverse changes in the above key assumptions are as
follows:

These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. Changes
in fair value based on a 10% variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the
relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also in
this table, the effect of a variation of a particular assumption on the fair value is calculated
without changing any other assumptions. It is likely that changes in one factor may result in
changes in another, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities.

sixty days or more and the related credit losses incurred are presented below:

7.  
       
      Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 consist of
the following: 

We test goodwill for impairment annually at the beginning of our fourth quarter, or
more frequently if events occur indicating it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting
unit s net assets has been reduced below its carrying value. No such impairment or events
indicating impairment were identified within any of our segments during the nine months ended
January 31, 2006. Our evaluation of impairment is dependent upon various assumptions, including
assumptions regarding projected operating results and cash flows of reporting units. Actual results
could differ materially from our projections and those differences could alter our conclusions
regarding the fair value of a reporting unit and its goodwill.

Intangible assets consist of the following:

Amortization of intangible assets for the three and nine months ended January 31,
2006 was $16.7 million and $47.3 million, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets for the
three and nine months ended January 31, 2005 was $15.5 million and $45.9 million, respectively.
Estimated amortization of intangible assets for fiscal years 2006 through 2010 is $65.1 million,
$56.3 million, $38.4 million, $15.0 million and $12.8 million, respectively.

-11-

Table of Contents   

The goodwill and intangible assets added in the Business Services segment relate primarily to
the acquisition of American Express Tax and Business Services, Inc., as discussed in note 3. The
intangible asset valuations were completed during the quarter, however, goodwill is subject to
change pending determination of the final purchase price.

8.  
       
      Derivative Instruments  

We enter into derivative instruments to reduce risks relating to mortgage loans we originate and
sell, and therefore all gains or losses are included in gains on sales of mortgage assets, net in
the condensed consolidated income statements. A summary of our derivative instruments as of January
31, 2006 and April 30, 2005, and gains or losses incurred during the three and nine months ended
January 31, 2006 and 2005 is as follows: 

We generally use interest rate swaps and forward loan sale commitments to reduce
interest rate risk associated with non-prime loans. We generally enter into interest rate swap
arrangements related to existing loan applications with rate-lock commitments and for rate-lock
commitments we expect to make in the next two to three weeks. Interest rate swaps represent an
agreement to exchange interest rate payments, whereby we pay a fixed rate and receive a floating
rate. As a result, these contracts increase in value as rates rise and decrease in value as rates
fall. The notional amount of interest rate swaps to which we were a party at January 31, 2006 was
$8.8 billion, with a weighted average duration of 1.9 years.

We generally enter into interest rate caps or swaps to mitigate interest rate risk associated
with mortgage loans that will be securitized and residual interests that are classified as trading
securities because they will be sold in a subsequent NIM transaction. These instruments enhance the
marketability of the securitization and NIM transactions. An interest rate cap represents a right
to receive cash if interest rates rise above a contractual strike rate, its value therefore
increases as interest rates rise. The interest rate used in our interest rate caps is based on
LIBOR.

We enter into forward loan commitments to sell our non-prime mortgage loans to manage interest
rate risk. The notional value and the contract value of the forward commitments at January 31, 2006
was $5.3 billion. Most of our forward commitments give us the option to under- or over-deliver by
five percent.

In the normal course of business, we enter into commitments with our customers to fund both
non-prime and prime mortgage loans for specified periods of time at  locked-in  interest rates.
These derivative instruments represent commitments to fund loans ( rate-lock equivalents ). The
fair value of non-prime loan commitments is calculated using a binomial option model, although we
do not initially record an asset for non-prime commitments to fund loans. The fair value of prime
loan commitments is calculated based on the current market pricing of short sales of FNMA, FHLMC
and GNMA mortgage-backed securities and the coupon rates of the eligible loans.

We sell short FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA mortgage-backed securities to reduce our risk related to
our commitments to fund fixed-rate prime loans. The position on certain or all of the fixed-rate
mortgage loans is closed approximately 10-15 days prior to standard Public Securities Association
(PSA) settlement dates.

None of our derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment as of January 31,
2006 or April 30, 2005.

      Stock-Based Compensation  

Effective May 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  (SFAS 123), under the
prospective transition method as described in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148,
 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation   Transition and Disclosure.  Had compensation cost for
all stock-based compensation plan grants been determined in accordance with the fair value
accounting method prescribed under SFAS 123, our net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share
would have been as follows:

      Supplemental Cash Flow Information  

During the nine months ended January 31, 2006, we paid $224.8 million and $63.0 million for income
taxes and interest, respectively. During the nine months ended January 31, 2005, we paid $406.6
million and $53.6 million for income taxes and interest, respectively. See note 3 for discussion of
cash payments made, assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to our acquisition of American
Express Tax and Business Services, Inc. 

The following transactions were treated as non-cash investing activities in the condensed
consolidated statement of cash flows:

      Commitments and Contingencies  

We maintain two unsecured committed lines of credit (CLOCs) for working capital, support of our
commercial paper program and general corporate purposes. The two CLOCs are from a consortium of
thirty-one banks and expire in August 2010. These lines are subject to various affirmative and
negative covenants, including a minimum net worth covenant. These CLOCs were undrawn at January 31,
2006. 

We obtained an additional $900.0 million line of credit for the period of January 3 to
February 24, 2006 to back-up peak commercial paper issuance or use as an alternate source of
funding for RAL participations. This line is subject to various covenants, substantially similar to
the primary CLOCs. The balance outstanding on this facility at January 31, 2006 was $550.0 million.

As a result of our failure to file this Form 10-Q by the SEC s prescribed due date, we will be
unable to issue any debt securities under our shelf registration statement for a period of twelve
calendar months after the month of our filing.

We offer guarantees under our Peace of Mind (POM) program to tax clients whereby we will
assume the cost of additional taxes attributable to tax return preparation errors for which we are
responsible. We defer all revenues and direct costs associated with these guarantees, recognizing

-13-

Table of Contents   

these amounts over the term of the guarantee based upon historic and actual payment of claims.
Changes in the deferred revenue liability are as follows:

We have commitments to fund mortgage loans to customers as long as there is no
violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration
dates or other termination clauses. The commitments to fund loans amounted to $2.9 billion and $3.9
billion at January 31, 2006 and April 30, 2005, respectively. Of these commitments, $697.3 million
and $947.5 million are considered binding commitments as of January 31, 2006 and April 30, 2005,
respectively. External market forces impact the probability of commitments being exercised, and
therefore, total commitments outstanding do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

We have entered into loan sale agreements with investors in the normal course of business,
which include standard representations and warranties customary to the mortgage banking industry.
Violations of these representations and warranties may require us to repurchase loans previously
sold. A liability has been established related to the potential loss on repurchase of loans
previously sold of $40.9 million and $41.2 million at January 31, 2006 and April 30, 2005,
respectively, based on historical experience. Repurchased loans are normally sold in subsequent
sale transactions.

Option One Mortgage Corporation provides a guarantee up to a maximum amount equal to
approximately 10% of the aggregate principal balance of mortgage loans held by the Trusts before
ultimate disposition of the loans. This guarantee would be called upon in the event adequate
proceeds were not available from the sale of the mortgage loans by the Trusts to satisfy their
payment obligations. No losses have been sustained on this commitment since its inception. The
total principal amount of Trust obligations outstanding as of January 31, 2006 and April 30, 2005
was $11.2 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively. The fair value of mortgage loans held by the
Trusts as of January 31, 2006 and April 30, 2005 was $11.4 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively.

We have various contingent purchase price obligations in connection with prior acquisitions.
In many cases, contingent payments to be made in connection with these acquisitions are not subject
to a stated limit. We estimate the potential payments (undiscounted) total approximately $13.8
million and $5.1 million as of January 31, 2006 and April 30, 2005, respectively. Our estimate is
based on current financial conditions. Should actual results differ materially from our
assumptions, the potential payments will differ from the above estimate. Such payments, if and when
paid, would be recorded as additional cost of the acquired business, generally goodwill.

We have contractual commitments to fund certain franchises requesting draws on Franchise
Equity Lines of Credit (FELCs). Our commitment to fund FELCs as of January 31, 2006 and April 30,
2005 totaled $75.9 million and $68.9 million, respectively. We have a receivable of $60.2 million
and $39.0 million, which represents the amounts drawn on the FELCs, as of January 31, 2006 and
April 30, 2005, respectively.

We routinely enter into contracts that include embedded indemnifications that have
characteristics similar to guarantees, including obligations to protect counterparties from losses
arising from the following: (a) tax, legal and other risks related to the purchase or disposition
of businesses; (b) penalties and interest assessed by Federal and state taxing authorities in
connection with tax returns prepared for clients; (c) indemnification of our directors and
officers; and (d) third-party claims relating to various arrangements in the normal course of
business. Typically, there is no stated maximum payment related to these indemnifications, and the
term of indemnities may vary and in many cases is limited only by the applicable statute of
limitations. The likelihood of any claims being asserted against us and the ultimate liability
related to any such claims, if any, is difficult to predict. While we cannot provide assurance that
such claims will not be successfully
asserted, we believe the fair value of these guarantees and indemnifications is not material as of
January 31, 2006.

      Litigation Commitments and Contingencies  

We have been involved in a number of class actions and putative class action cases since 1990, as
well as a state attorney general lawsuit, regarding our RAL programs. These cases are based on a
variety of legal theories and allegations. These theories and allegations include, among others,
that (i) we improperly did not disclose license fees we received from RAL lending banks for RALs
they make to our clients, (ii) we owe and breached a fiduciary duty to our clients and (iii) the
RAL program violates laws such as state credit service organization laws and the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. Although we have successfully defended many RAL
cases, we have settled others. On December 21, 2005, we entered into a settlement agreement
regarding four RAL cases, subject to final court approval. Pursuant to the terms of this
settlement agreement, we will contribute a total of up to $62.5 million in cash for purposes of
making payments to the settlement class, paying all attorneys  fees and costs to class counsel and
covering service awards to the representative plaintiffs. In addition, we will pay costs for
providing notice of the settlement to settlement class members. We recorded a reserve of $52.2
million related to this settlement in our third quarter. Two RAL class action cases and the state
attorney general lawsuit are still pending, with the amounts claimed on a collective basis being
very substantial. The ultimate cost of this litigation could be substantial, and in March 2006, we
increased our reserves as of January 31, 2006 by an additional $19.5 million related to one of the
other RAL cases. We intend to continue defending the other RAL cases vigorously, although there are
no assurances as to their outcome. 

We are also a party to claims and lawsuits pertaining to our electronic tax return filing
services, our POM guarantee program, and our Express IRA product. These claims and lawsuits include
actions by individual plaintiffs, as well as cases in which plaintiffs seek to represent a class of
similarly situated customers. In addition we are party to two shareholder derivative actions
stemming from our recent financial restatement as well as separate putative class actions alleging
violations of certain securities laws. The amounts claimed in these claims and lawsuits are
substantial in some instances, and the ultimate liability with respect to such litigation and
claims is difficult to predict. We intend to continue defending these cases vigorously, although
there are no assurances as to their outcome.

In addition to the aforementioned types of cases, we are parties to claims and lawsuits that
we consider to be ordinary, routine disputes incidental to our business (Other Claims and
Lawsuits), including claims and lawsuits concerning the preparation of customers  income tax
returns, the fees charged customers for various services, investment products, relationships with
franchisees, contract disputes, employment matters and civil actions, arbitrations, regulatory
inquiries and class actions arising out of our business as a broker-dealer and provider of
investment products and as a servicer of mortgage loans. We believe we have meritorious defenses to
each of the Other Claims and Lawsuits and are defending them vigorously. Although we cannot provide
assurance we will ultimately prevail in each instance, we believe that amounts, if any, required to
be paid in the discharge of liabilities or settlements pertaining to Other Claims and Lawsuits will
not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. Regardless of outcome,
claims and litigation can adversely affect us due to defense costs, diversion of management
attention and time, and publicity related to such matters.

It is our policy to accrue for amounts related to legal matters if it is probable that a
liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Many of
the various legal proceedings are covered in whole or in part by insurance. Any receivable for
insurance recoveries is recorded separately from the corresponding litigation reserve, and only if
recovery is determined to be probable. Receivables for insurance recoveries at January 31, 2006
were immaterial.

      New Accounting Pronouncements  

In February 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 155,  Accounting for Certain
Hybrid Instruments  (SFAS 155), an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140, was issued. The
provisions of this standard allow financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be
accounted for as a whole if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value
basis, and establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to
identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that
contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation. The new standard also amends Statement 140 to
eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative
financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial
instrument. The provisions of this standard are effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year
2008. Our residual interests typically have interests in derivative instruments embedded within the
securitization trusts. If we elect to account for our residual interests on a fair value basis,
changes in fair value will impact earnings in the period in which the change occurs. We are
currently evaluating what effect the adoption of SFAS 155 will have on our consolidated financial
statements. 

In March 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 156,  Accounting for Servicing
of Financial Assets   An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 140,  (SFAS 156), was issued. The
provisions of this standard require mortgage servicing rights to be initially valued at fair value.
SFAS 156 also allows servicers to choose to measure their servicing rights at fair value or to
continue using the  amortization method  under SFAS 140. The provisions of this standard are
effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year 2008. We are currently evaluating what effect the
adoption of SFAS 156 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

Exposure Draft   Amendment of SFAS 140

In August 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an exposure draft which
amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140,  Accounting for Transfers and Servicing
of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. 

This exposure draft seeks to clarify the derecognition requirements for financial assets and
the initial measurement of interests related to transferred financial assets that are held by a
transferor. Our current off-balance sheet warehouse facilities (the Trusts) in our Mortgage
Services segment would be required to be consolidated in our financial statements based on the
provisions of the

-16-

Table of Contents   

exposure draft. We will continue to monitor the status of the exposure draft and consider what
changes, if any, could be made to the structure of the Trusts to continue to derecognize mortgage
loans transferred to the Trusts. At January 31, 2006, the Trusts held loans totaling $11.2 billion,
which we would be required to consolidate into our financial statements under the provisions of
this exposure draft.

The final standard for this exposure draft is scheduled to be issued in the second quarter of
calendar year 2006.

Table of Contents   

Three months ended January 31, 2006 compared to January 31, 2005 

Tax Services  revenues increased $17.4 million, or 3.3%, for the three months ended January 31,
2006 compared to the prior year.

Tax preparation and related fees increased $13.7 million, or 3.6%, for the current quarter.
This increase is primarily due to an increase of 6.8% in the average fee per U.S. client served,
partially offset by a decrease of 3.2% in U.S. clients served in company-owned offices. The
decrease in clients served was partially due to a number of technology problems that severely hurt
the start of our filing season coupled with increased competition due to competitors  refund
lending products.

Online tax service revenue declined $3.7 million, or 34.3%, primarily due to planned
reductions in unit prices.

Royalty revenue increased $2.8 million, or 5.5%, due to a 4.8% increase in the average fee
slightly offset by a 0.4% decline in clients served in franchise offices.

Other revenues increased $4.7 million primarily due to an increase in supply sales to
franchises during the current quarter.

Total expenses increased $87.4 million, or 18.7%, primarily due to $71.7 million of legal
reserves and related litigation fees recorded in the current period. During the current quarter we
entered into a settlement agreement regarding four separate RAL cases covering 22 states. As a
result of this settlement agreement, we recorded a pretax charge of $52.2 million, or $0.10 per
diluted share, for the unreserved cost of the proposed litigation settlement and related fees. In
March 2006, we engaged in settlement negotiations with
plaintiffs in another RAL case and accordingly increased our reserves as of January 31, 2006 and
recorded a pretax charge of $19.5 million. See additional discussion below and in note 12 to the
condensed consolidated financial statements.

Cost of services for the three months ended January 31, 2006 increased $7.6 million, or 2.3%,
from the prior year. Our real estate expansion efforts have contributed to a total increase of
$13.0 million across all cost of services categories. Compensation and benefits increased $9.1
million, or 5.0%, primarily due to an increase in staff needed for our new offices and the addition
of costs related to our small business initiatives in the current year. Occupancy expenses
increased $4.6 million, or 6.1%, primarily as a result of higher rent expenses, due to a 9.6%
increase in company-owned offices under lease and a 7.5% increase in the average rent. Depreciation
declined $3.8 million, or 25.3%, primarily due to decreased capital expenditures compared to the
prior year and the timing of certain depreciation expenses. Other cost of services declined $2.4
million, or 4.4%, due to a decline of $3.4 million in corporate shared services and lower expenses
associated with our POM guarantee, partially offset by an increase of $3.8 million in supplies
expenses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $10.5 million, or 8.3%, primarily due
to a $9.7 million increase in corporate shared services, $6.6 million of which was related to our
marketing efforts. We also incurred higher costs associated with increased supply sales to
franchises and additional costs related to our small business initiatives in the current year.

The pretax loss was $6.3 million for the three months ended January 31, 2006 compared to
income of $63.7 million in the prior year.

Due to the seasonal nature of this segment s business, operating results for the three months
ended January 31, 2006 are not comparable to the three months ended October 31, 2005 and are not
indicative of the expected results for the entire fiscal year.

Nine months ended January 31, 2006 compared to January 31, 2005 

Tax Services  revenues increased $30.9 million, or 4.7%, for the nine months ended January 31, 2006
compared to the prior year.

Tax preparation and related fees increased $24.5 million, or 5.7%, primarily due to an
increase in the average fee per U.S. client served, partially offset by a decrease in U.S. clients
served in company-owned offices during the first month of the tax season. Improved performance
during the Australian and Canadian tax seasons also contributed $3.0 million and $2.6 million,
respectively, of additional tax preparation revenues in the current year.

Online tax service revenue declined $3.7 million, or 31.0%, primarily due to planned
reductions in unit prices.

-23-

Table of Contents   

Other service revenues increased $8.8 million primarily as a result of additional revenues
associated with POM guarantees and our small business initiatives.

Royalty revenue increased $4.0 million, or 7.1%, due to an increase in the average fee
slightly offset by a slight decline in clients served in franchise offices.

Total expenses increased $141.6 million, or 16.9%, primarily due to $71.7 million of legal
reserves and related litigation fees recorded in the current period. Cost of services for the nine
months ended January 31, 2006 increased $47.7 million, or 8.1%, from the prior year. Our real
estate expansion efforts have contributed to a total increase of $29.0 million across all cost of
services categories.

Compensation and benefits increased $25.4 million primarily due to an increase in the staff
needed for our new offices, payroll taxes and the addition of costs related to our small business
initiatives. Occupancy expenses increased $23.0 million, or 12.9%, primarily as a result of higher
rent expenses, due to an 8.9% increase in company-owned offices under lease and an 8.5% increase in
the average rent. Utilities and real estate taxes also contributed to the increase.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $25.0 million, or 11.1%, over the prior
year primarily due to $13.1 million in additional costs from corporate shared services, $7.6
million of which was related to our marketing efforts. We also incurred $4.1 million in additional
legal expenses and $6.0 million in additional corporate wages.

The pretax loss was $293.7 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 compared to a
prior year loss of $182.9 million.

Fiscal 2006 outlook 

Our fiscal year 2006 outlook for the Tax Services segment has not changed materially from the
discussion in our April 30, 2005 Form 10-K/A. As part of our real estate expansion, we opened 550
new company-owned offices and 184 new franchise offices in the current tax season, exceeding our
goal to open between 500 and 700 company-owned and franchise offices this year.

RAL Litigation 

On December 21, 2005, we entered into a settlement agreement regarding litigation pertaining to our
RAL programs entitled  Deadra D. Cummins, et al .  v. H R Block ,  Inc. et al. ;  Mitchell v. H R Block,
Inc. et al.; Green v. H R Block, Inc. et al.;  and  Becker v. H R Block, Inc.  (the  Settlement
Agreement ) .  The Settlement Agreement is subject to final court approval. Pursuant to the
Settlement Agreement s terms, we will contribute a total of up to $62.5 million in cash for
purposes of making payments to the settlement class, paying all attorneys  fees and costs to class
counsel, and covering service awards to the representative plaintiffs. In addition, we will pay
costs for providing notice of the settlement to settlement class members. We recorded a reserve of
$52.2 million related to this settlement in our third quarter.

We are named as a defendant in two other class-action lawsuits and one state attorney general
lawsuit alleging that we engaged in wrongdoing with respect to the RAL program. In March 2006, we
engaged in settlement negotiations with the plaintiffs in one of these RAL cases and accordingly
increased our reserves as of January 31, 2006 by $19.5 million. We believe we have strong defenses
to the other lawsuits and will vigorously defend our position. Nevertheless, the amounts claimed in
these lawsuits are, in some instances, very substantial, and there can be no assurances as to their
ultimate outcome, or as to their impact on our financial statements. See additional discussion of
RAL Litigation in note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements and in Part II, Item
1,  Legal Proceedings. 

MORTGAGE SERVICES 

This segment is primarily engaged in the origination of non-prime mortgage loans through an
independent broker network, the origination of prime and non-prime mortgage loans through a retail
office network, the sale and securitization of mortgage loans and residual interests, and the
servicing of non-prime loans.

Mortgage Services   Operating Results 

Three months ended January 31, 2006 compared to January 31, 2005 

Mortgage Services  revenues decreased $12.4 million, or 4.0%, for the three months ended January
31, 2006 compared to the prior year. Revenues decreased as a result of lower margins on mortgage
loans sold and a decline in gains on derivatives, partially offset by higher loan servicing
revenue.

The following table summarizes the key drivers of gains on sales of mortgage loans:

(1)  
       
     Includes all direct sales and back office sales support associates.  

(2)  
       
     Percentage of loans funded divided by total applications in the period. 

(3)  
       
     Defined as gain on sale of mortgage loans (including gain or loss on derivatives,
mortgage servicing rights and net of direct origination and acquisition expenses) divided by
origination volume. 

Despite a 6.7% increase in loan origination volume, gains on sales of mortgage loans
decreased $11.0 million, primarily as a result of moderating demand by loan buyers and rapidly
rising two-year swap rates. Market interest rates, based on the two-year swap, increased from an
average of 3.39% last year to 4.83% in the current quarter. However, our WAC increased only 97
basis points, up to 8.27% from 7.30% in the prior year. Because of poor alignment of our WAC with
market rates and increases in our funding costs, our gross margin declined 56 basis points, to
1.86% from 2.42% last year.

-26-

Table of Contents   

The value of MSRs we recorded in the third quarter increased to 67 basis points from 43 basis
points in the prior year, which coupled with an increase in origination volume, resulted in an
increase of $24.3 million in gains on sales of mortgage loans. In the second quarter of fiscal year
2006, we completed an evaluation of the assumptions used to value our MSRs. Based on the changes in
our assumptions as a result of this evaluation, the gain on sale for our retained MSRs increased by
approximately 14 basis points, primarily as a result of lower servicing costs, in particular
interest paid to bondholders on monthly loan prepayments. In addition, the increase in average loan
size to $194,000 from $164,000 in the current quarter resulted in an approximate 8 basis point
increase in the value of retained MSRs.

To mitigate the risk of short-term changes in market interest rates related to our loan
originations, we use interest rate swaps and forward loan sale commitments. We generally enter into
interest rate swap arrangements related to existing loan applications with rate-lock commitments
and for rate-lock commitments we expect to make in the next two to three weeks. During the current
quarter, we recorded a net $5.1 million in gains, compared to $30.8 million in the prior year,
related to our various derivative instruments. See note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial
statements.

During the current quarter, our available-for-sale residual interests performed better than
expected in our internal valuation models, with lower credit losses than originally modeled,
partially offset by higher interest rates. We recorded favorable pretax mark-to-market adjustments,
which increased the fair value of our residual interests $16.8 million during the quarter. These
adjustments were recorded, net of write-downs of $3.7 million and deferred taxes of $5.0 million,
in other comprehensive income and will be accreted into income throughout the remaining life of
those residual interests. Offsetting this increase were impairments of $8.6 million, which were
recorded in gains on sales of mortgage assets. Future changes in interest rates or other
assumptions, based on market conditions or actual loan pool performance, could cause additional
adjustments to the fair value of the residual interests and could cause changes to the accretion of
these residual interests in future periods.

The following table summarizes the key drivers of loan servicing revenues:

Loan servicing revenues increased $33.1 million, or 45.4%, compared to the prior
year. The increase reflects a higher loan servicing portfolio resulting from our continued
origination growth. The average servicing portfolio for the three months ended January 31, 2006
increased $23.1 billion, or 40.2%, to $80.4 billion. The annualized rate earned on our entire
servicing portfolio was 34 basis points for the current quarter, compared to 37 basis points in the
prior year.

Total expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2006, increased $35.7 million, or 18.4%,
over the prior year. Cost of services increased $26.3 million as a result of a higher average
servicing portfolio during the current quarter and increased amortization of MSRs.

Cost of other revenues increased $12.2 million, primarily due to $6.5 million in increased
compensation and benefits as a result of an increase in the average number of sales associates
during the period and origination-based incentives. Other expenses increased $6.0 million primarily
as a

result of $6.1 million in additional interest expense related to mortgage loans held on our
balance sheet.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $2.8 million due to a reduction in
corporate staffing levels.

Pretax income decreased $48.0 million to $67.5 million for the three months ended January 31,
2006.

Three months ended January 31, 2006 compared to October 31, 2005 

Mortgage Services  revenues increased $10.3 million, or 3.6%, for the three months ended January
31, 2006, compared to the second quarter. Revenues increased primarily due to improving margins and
higher loan servicing revenue, partially offset by lower gains on derivatives and a gain on sale of
residual interests recorded in the second quarter.

The following table summarizes the key drivers of gains on sales of mortgage loans:

(1)  
       
     Includes all direct sales and back office sales support associates.  

(2)  
       
     Percentage of loans funded divided by total applications in the period. 

(3)  
       
     Defined as gain on sale of mortgage loans (including gain or loss on derivatives,
mortgage servicing rights and net of direct origination and acquisition expenses) divided by
origination volume. 

Gains on sales of mortgage loans increased $94.8 million primarily as a result of
better pricing in the market coupled with increases in our coupon rates and lower origination
expenses. We implemented a series of increases in our coupon rate beginning in September 2005 and
continuing into our third quarter, and as a result, our WAC increased 79 basis points, from 7.48%
to 8.27%. These rate changes, which were partially offset by lower gains on derivatives, caused our
net gain on sale   gross margin to increase 85 basis points. Our loan origination volumes
decreased 29.1% from the second quarter.

To mitigate the risk of short-term changes in market interest rates, we use interest rate
swaps and forward loan sale commitments. We recorded $5.1 million in net gains during the third
quarter, compared to $60.8 million in the second quarter, related to our various derivative
instruments. See note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

During the preceding quarter, we recorded a $28.7 million gain on the sale of
available-for-sale residual interests. This gain accelerated cash flows from residual interests,
and resulted in realization of previously recorded unrealized gains included in other comprehensive
income. We had no similar transaction in the current quarter.

The following table summarizes the key drivers of loan servicing revenues:

Loan servicing revenues increased $5.7 million, or 5.7%, compared to the second
quarter. The increase reflects a higher average loan servicing portfolio, which increased $3.2
billion, or 4.1%. The annualized rate earned on our entire servicing portfolio was 34 basis points
for the current quarter, which was flat compared to the second quarter rate.

Total expenses decreased $10.9 million compared to the second quarter. Cost of services
increased $15.3 million as a result of a higher average servicing portfolio during the current
quarter. Cost of other revenues decreased $18.9 million, primarily due to a $13.5 million decrease
in compensation and benefits as a result of 10.8% decrease in sales associates and lower
origination-based incentives. Other expenses decreased $4.1 million for the current quarter,
primarily due to cost savings initiatives, partially offset by $2.2 million in additional interest
expense.

Selling, general and administrative expenses declined $7.2 million, or 14.8%, due to cost
savings initiatives and lower marketing expenses.

Pretax income increased $21.2 million, or 45.9%, for the three months ended January 31, 2006
compared to the preceding quarter.

Mortgage Services   Operating Results 

Nine months ended January 31, 2006 compared to January 31, 2005 

Mortgage Services  revenues increased $77.9 million, or 9.0%, for the nine months ended January 31,
2006 compared to the prior year. Revenues increased as a result of higher loan servicing revenues,
increased gains on derivatives and a gain on sale of residual interests, partially offset by lower
margins on mortgage loans sold and impairments of residual interests.

The following table summarizes the key drivers of gains on sales of mortgage loans:

(1)  
       
     Includes all direct sales and back office sales support associates.  

(2)  
       
     Percentage of loans funded divided by total applications in the period. 

(3)  
       
     Defined as gain on sale of mortgage loans (including gain or loss on derivatives,
mortgage servicing rights and net of direct origination and acquisition expenses) divided by
origination volume. 

Gains on sales of mortgage loans decreased $94.2 million, primarily as a result of
rapidly rising two-year swap rates and moderating demand by loan buyers, partially offset by
increased origination volume. Market interest rates, based on the two-year swap, increased from an
average of 3.10% last year to 4.45% in the current year. However, our WAC increased only 39 basis
points, up to 7.71% from 7.32% in the prior year. Because our WAC was not more aligned with market rates,
increased

-31-

Table of Contents   

funding costs and poor pricing in the market, offset by derivative gains, our gross
margin declined 97 basis points, to 1.67% from 2.64% last year. Origination volumes increased 49.4%
over the prior year, due to increased productivity of our account executives and support staff, new
product introductions, increased applications and a higher closing ratio.

Changes in our MSR assumptions, an increase in the average loan size and an increase in
origination volume resulted in an increase of $101.7 million
related to the retained MSR component of gains on sales of mortgage loans.

As a result of rising interest rates and an increase in the notional amounts of interest rate
swaps in place as a result of increased origination volumes during the current year, we recorded a
net $91.9 million in gains, compared to $28.8 million in the prior year, related to our various
derivative instruments. See note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

We recorded a $0.6 million net favorable mark-to-market adjustment for our trading residuals
during the current period, and a gain of $28.7 million on the sale of residual interests. During
the prior year, we recorded $5.4 million in net favorable mark-to-market adjustments for our
trading residuals.

During the nine months ended January 31, 2006, our available-for-sale residual interests
performed better than expected in our internal valuation models, with lower credit losses than
originally modeled, partially offset by higher interest rates. We recorded favorable pretax
mark-to-market adjustments, which increased the fair value of our residual interests $47.8 million
during the period. These adjustments were recorded, net of write-downs of $8.9 million and deferred
taxes of $14.9 million, in other comprehensive income and will be accreted into income throughout
the remaining life of those residual interests. Offsetting this increase were impairments of
available-for-sale residual interests totaling $29.2 million, which were recorded in gains on sales
of mortgage assets. Impairments increased $22.0 million over the prior year due to interest rates
increasing greater than originally modeled and a decline in the value of older residuals based on
loan performance.

During the current year, Gulf Coast hurricanes caused severe damage to property, including
property securing mortgage loans underlying our beneficial and residual interests. As of January
31, 2006, we have exposure to losses related to approximately $359 million of loans in the affected
areas, including $338 million related to loans underlying securitizations in which we hold a
residual interest and $21 million related to loans that are in the Trusts or have been repurchased
from the Trusts. At January 31, 2006, total 31  days delinquencies in the affected areas were
approximately $106 million, compared to approximately $50 million that were 31  days delinquent
prior to the hurricanes. We recorded a specific provision for estimated losses arising from
hurricane damage totaling $6.0 million during our second quarter, based on an analysis of
delinquent loans within the federally declared disaster areas. Of the total provision, $3.1 million
was recorded as a reserve for losses on loans that we have or may be required to repurchase
pursuant to existing standard representations and warranties, and $2.9 million was recorded as an
impairment of our residual interests. There were no significant
changes to the reserves during the third quarter. In addition to the residual impairments recorded this
quarter, future write-downs of residual interests may be incurred and recorded in other
comprehensive income. We are continuing to analyze our exposure to potential losses and the amount
of losses ultimately realized may differ from amounts previously recorded.

The following table summarizes the key drivers of loan servicing revenues:

Loan servicing revenues increased $103.0 million, or 53.2%, compared to the prior
year. The increase reflects a higher loan servicing portfolio. The average servicing portfolio for
the nine months ended January 31, 2006 increased $23.8 billion, or 45.6%, to $76.0 billion. The
annualized rate earned on our entire servicing portfolio was 34 basis points for the current
period, compared to 36 basis points in the prior year.

Total expenses for the nine months ended January 31, 2006, increased $162.7 million, or 30.6%,
over the prior year. Cost of services increased $55.7 million as a result of a higher average
servicing portfolio during the current period and increased amortization of MSRs. Cost of other
revenues increased $94.0 million, primarily due to $69.9 million in increased compensation and
benefits as a result of an increase in the average number of sales associates during the period and
origination-based incentives. Occupancy expenses increased $5.9 million, or 22.1%, primarily as a
result of an increase in branch offices and related equipment and utilities costs. Other expenses
increased $18.3 million primarily as a result of $13.3 million in additional interest expense
related to loans held on our balance sheet, coupled with increases in depreciation and supplies.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $13.0 million primarily due to $16.0
million in additional retail marketing costs.

Pretax income decreased $84.8 million to $248.2 million for the nine months ended January 31,
2006.

Fiscal 2006 outlook 

For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, we believe we can achieve funding volumes of
approximately $8 billion to $9 billion resulting in full year origination growth of approximately
30%. As a result of higher WACs on funded mortgage loans, a stabilizing external rate environment
and further cost-saving measures, we believe we will see origination margins of 90 to 100 basis
points in the fourth quarter, resulting in an origination margin of 45 to 55 basis points for the
full fiscal year. During the fourth quarter, we expect to take actions to reduce staffing levels
and close a number of branches, which is estimated to result in a pretax charge of $10 million to
$12 million. Excluding the charge associated with these actions, we believe that our fourth quarter
cost of origination will approximate 175 basis points.

Business Services   Operating Results 

Three months ended January 31, 2006 compared to January 31, 2005 

Business Services  revenues for the three months ended January 31, 2006 increased $103.0 million,
or 77.5%, from the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of American
Express Tax and Business Services, Inc., which increased accounting, tax and consulting revenues
$95.4 million.

Capital markets revenues declined $4.1 million due to a 34.2% decline in the number of
business valuation projects. Payroll, benefits and retirement services revenues increased $2.9
million primarily due to acquisitions completed during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year
2005. Other service revenues increased $8.1 million as a result of acquisitions completed in the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 in our financial process outsourcing business and growth in
wealth management services.

Total expenses increased $109.9 million, or 86.6%, for the three months ended January 31, 2006
compared to the prior year. Cost of services increased $85.5 million, primarily due to a $61.8
million increase in compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits increased $57.9 million
due to the American Express Tax and Business Services, Inc. acquisition. Baseline increases in the
number of personnel and the average wage per employee, driven by marketplace competition for
professional staff, also contributed to the increase. Occupancy expenses increased $11.7 million
due primarily to acquisitions. Other cost of services increased $12.0 million primarily due to the
American Express Tax and Business Services, Inc. acquisition.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $24.4 million primarily due to
acquisitions and additional costs associated with our business development initiatives.

Due to the seasonal nature of this segment s business, operating results for the three months
ended January 31, 2006 are not comparable to the three months ended October 31, 2005 and are not
indicative of the expected results for the entire fiscal year.

Nine months ended January 31, 2006 compared to January 31, 2005 

Business Services  revenues for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 increased $158.5 million, or
42.7%, from the prior year. This increase was primarily due to a $133.3 million increase in
accounting, tax and consulting revenues resulting primarily from the acquisition of American
Express Tax and Business Services, Inc., which increased revenues $115.9 million. We also benefited
from a 6.9% increase in the net billed rate per hour, excluding the impact of the acquisition.

Capital markets revenues declined $3.9 million due to a 19.6% decline in the number of
business valuation projects. Payroll, benefits and retirement services revenues increased $11.3
million, or 78.6%, primarily due to acquisitions completed during the third and fourth quarters of
fiscal year 2005. Other service revenues increased $15.0 million as a result of acquisitions
completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 in our financial process outsourcing business
and growth in wealth management services.

Total expenses increased $159.4 million, or 41.9%, for the nine months ended January 31, 2006
compared to the prior year. Cost of services increased $123.1 million, primarily due to a $90.3
million increase in compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits increased $72.0 million
due to the American Express Tax and Business Services, Inc. acquisition. Baseline increases in the
number of personnel and the average wage per employee, driven by marketplace competition for
professional staff and other acquisitions completed in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year
2005, also contributed to this increase. Occupancy expenses increased $20.5 million due primarily
to acquisitions. Other cost of services increased $12.3 million primarily due to the American
Express Tax and Business Services, Inc. acquisition.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $36.3 million primarily due to
acquisitions and additional costs associated with our business development initiatives.

The pretax loss for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 was $9.9 million, which includes
losses of $9.3 million from American Express Tax and Business Services, Inc., compared to $9.0
million in the prior year.

Fiscal 2006 outlook 

Our fiscal year 2006 outlook for our Business Services segment is consistent with the discussion in
our April 30, 2005 Form 10-K/A, except for the previously announced acquisition of American Express
Tax and Business Services, Inc. effective October 1, 2005. We expect organic growth for this
segment s pretax income of approximately 30%, and expect the acquisition of American Express Tax
and Business Services, Inc. will be accretive by two cents per diluted share for fiscal year 2006,
after expected integration costs. We expect Business Services  pretax income for fiscal year 2006
to increase nearly 75% over the prior year.

     Total revenues, less interest expense. 

Three months ended January 31, 2006 compared to January 31, 2005 

Investment Services  revenues, net of interest expense, for the three months ended January 31, 2006
increased $10.4 million, or 17.0%.

Production revenue increased $5.3 million, or 12.4%, over the prior year. Transactional
revenue, which is based on sales of individual securities, decreased $1.6 million, or 6.4%, from
the prior year due primarily to a 5.5% decrease in average revenue per transactional trade and a
0.4% decrease in transactional trading volume. Annuitized revenue, which is based on sales of
various fee-based products, increased $6.9 million, or 37.6%, due to increased sales of annuities
and insurance, wealth management accounts, mutual funds, and unit investment trusts (UITs). The
shift in revenues from transactional to annuitized demonstrates our continued move toward an
advice-based focus.

Annualized productivity averaged approximately $201,000 per advisor during the current quarter
compared to $172,000 in the prior year. Increased productivity was due to higher production levels
across all recruiting classes. Minimum production standards put into place during the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2005 resulted in 122 advisors increasing their production to date. These
standards also resulted in 141 low-producing advisors leaving the company to date. We expect
average advisor productivity to continue increasing throughout the remainder of the fiscal year.

Margin interest revenue increased $4.0 million, or 33.2%, from the prior year, as a result of
higher interest rates earned, partially offset by a decline in average margin balances.

Total expenses decreased $1.7 million, or 2.1%. Cost of services increased $6.3 million, or
15.7%, primarily as a result of $6.9 million of additional compensation and benefits expenses
resulting from higher production revenues.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $8.1 million, or 20.0%, primarily due
to a $3.9 million decline in legal expenses, due in part to a favorable arbitration outcome.
Current quarter results also improved due to reduced back-office headcount relating to cost
containment efforts and gains on the disposition of certain assets during the quarter. These
decreases were partially offset by increased bonus accruals associated with the segment s improved
performance.

The pretax loss for Investment Services for the three months ended January 31, 2006 was $7.7
million compared to the prior year loss of $19.8 million.

Annuitized revenue increased $16.5 million, or 30.5%, due to increased sales of annuities,
insurance, mutual funds, wealth management accounts and UITs.

Annualized productivity averaged approximately $187,000 per advisor during the current year

Margin interest revenue increased $14.1 million, or 45.8%, from the prior year, as a result of
higher interest rates earned, partially offset by lower average margin balances.

Total expenses increased $1.5 million, or 0.7%. Cost of services increased $14.5 million, or
12.5%, primarily as a result of $14.2 million of additional compensation and benefits. This
increase is primarily due to higher production revenues, partially offset by cost containment
measures implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $13.0 million, or 11.6%, primarily due
to a $5.6 million decline in legal expenses, due in part to a favorable arbitration outcome. We
also experienced a $4.3 million decline in compensation and benefits from reduced back-office
headcount relating to cost containment efforts and $3.2 million in additional gains on the
disposition of certain assets during the year. These decreases were partially offset by increased
bonuses associated with the segment s improved performance.

Fiscal 2006 outlook 

Our fiscal year 2006 outlook for our Investment Services segment has improved slightly from the
discussion in our April 30, 2005 Form 10-K/A. We now anticipate the loss for Investment Services
for fiscal year 2006 will be approximately $30 million to $37 million less than the loss reported
in fiscal year 2005, instead of the $25 million to $35 million improvement we previously discussed.

CORPORATE 

This segment consists primarily of corporate support departments, which provide services to our
operating segments. These support departments consist of marketing, information technology,
facilities, human resources, executive, legal, finance, government relations and corporate
communications. Support department costs are generally allocated to our operating segments. Our
captive insurance and franchise financing subsidiaries are also included within this segment,
as was our small business initiatives subsidiary in the first half of fiscal year 2005.

Corporate   Operating Results 

Three months ended January 31, 2006 compared to January 31, 2005 

Marketing department expenses increased $6.5 million, or 14.2%, due primarily to an increase in
digital advertising efforts. Finance department expenses increased $2.0 million, primarily due to
additional consulting expenses and increases in compensation expenses. Other support department
expenses increased $7.0 million primarily due to increases in stock-based compensation expenses.

Other income declined $14.9 million primarily as a result of a $16.7 million legal recovery we
received during the prior year quarter.

The pretax loss was $27.0 million, compared with last year s third quarter loss of $12.0
million.

Due to the nature of this segment, the three months ended January 31, 2006 are not comparable
to the three months ended October 31, 2005 and are not indicative of the expected results for the
entire fiscal year.

Our effective tax rate for the quarter increased to 52.3% compared
to 38.8% in the prior year. This increase is due to an additional
$3.4 million in income tax expense in the current quarter related to the correction of errors
in state income taxes for periods prior to May 1, 2003. See
discussion of restatement in note 2A to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Nine months ended January 31, 2006 compared to January 31, 2005 

Corporate expenses increased $2.9 million primarily due an increase of $4.6 million in allocated
costs from finance shared services and $1.5 million in additional consulting, accounting and
auditing expenses related to the restatement of our previously issued financial statements. These
increases were partially offset by a decline of $6.1 million in interest expense.

Our consolidated interest expense, both operating and non-operating, totaled $74.3 million for
the nine months ended January 31, 2006, an increase of $9.3 million over the prior year. Of the
$74.3 million in total interest, $37.0 million related to interest expense on previous

remaining $37.3 million related to our operations recorded directly in our operating segments.
Intercompany interest expense, which is also recorded directly in our operating segments, is
eliminated within the Corporate segment. These eliminations resulted in the decline of $6.1 million
in interest expense recorded in our Corporate segment for the current period.

Information technology department expenses increased $4.2 million primarily due to higher
compensation and benefits. Marketing department expenses increased $6.4 million primarily due to an
increase in digital advertising. Finance department expenses increased $9.5 million, primarily due
to $5.1 million of additional consulting expenses and an increase of $4.5 million in compensation
expenses. Other support department expenses increased $4.8 million primarily due to increases in
stock-based compensation and legal department expenses, partially offset by a decrease in supply
department expenses.

Other income decreased $8.1 million primarily as a result of a $16.7 million legal recovery
received during the prior year, partially offset by a $3.4 million gain recognized on the sale of
an investment in the current year.

The pretax loss was $75.0 million, compared with last year s loss of $65.5 million.

Our
effective tax rate for the nine months ended January 31, 2006
decreased to 36.8% compared to 38.7% in the prior year. This decrease
is due to an additional $3.4 million in income tax expense in the current quarter related to the correction of errors
in state income taxes for periods prior to May 1, 2003. See
discussion of restatement in note 2A to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Cash From Operations.  Cash used in operations totaled $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion for the
nine months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in cash used in operating
activities is primarily due to increases in mortgage loans held for sale and MSRs during the
current year and increased losses. These items were partially offset by a decline in income tax
payments. Income tax payments totaled $224.8 million during the current year, a decrease of $181.8
million from the prior year.

Issuance of Common Stock.  We issue shares of common stock, in accordance with our stock-based
compensation plans, out of treasury shares. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock totaled
$105.8 million and $119.9 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

Dividends.  Dividends paid totaled $118.7 million and $106.4 million for the nine months ended
January 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. On June 8, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a
two-for-one stock split of the Company s Common Stock in the form of a 100% stock distribution,
effective August 22, 2005, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 1,
2005. All share and per share amounts in this document have been adjusted to reflect the
retroactive effect of the stock split.

Share Repurchases.  On June 9, 2004, our Board of Directors approved an authorization to
repurchase 15 million shares. During the nine months ended January 31, 2006, we repurchased 9.0
million shares pursuant to this authorization and a prior authorization at an aggregate price of
$254.2 million or an average price of $28.18 per share. There are 10.5 million shares remaining
under this authorization at January 31, 2006. We plan to continue to purchase shares on the open
market in accordance with this authorization, subject to various factors including the price of the
stock, the availability of excess cash, our ability to maintain liquidity and financial
flexibility, securities law restrictions, targeted capital levels and other investment
opportunities available.

Restricted Cash.  We hold certain cash balances that are restricted as to use.
Cash and cash equivalents   restricted totaled $430.7 million at January 31, 2006 compared to
$516.9 million at April 30, 2005. Investment Services held $376.0 million of this total
segregated in a special reserve account for the exclusive benefit of customers. Restricted cash
held by Mortgage Services totaled $48.1 million and is held primarily for outstanding commitments
to fund mortgage loans. Restricted

Table of Contents   

cash of $6.6 million at January 31, 2006 held by Business Services is related to funds held to pay
payroll taxes on behalf of its customers.

Segment Cash Flows.  A condensed consolidating statement of cash flows by segment for the nine
months ended January 31, 2006 follows. Generally, interest is not charged on intercompany
activities between segments.

Net intercompany activities are excluded from investing and financing activities
within the segment cash flows. We believe that by excluding intercompany activities, the cash flows
by segment more clearly depicts the cash generated and used by each segment. Had intercompany
activities been included, those segments in a net lending situation would have been included in
investing activities, and those in a net borrowing situation would have been included in financing
activities.

Tax Services.  Tax Services has historically been our largest provider of annual operating cash
flows. The seasonal nature of Tax Services generally results in a large positive operating cash
flow in the fourth quarter. Tax Services used $1.0 billion in its current nine-month operations to
cover off-season costs and working capital requirements. Cash used for seasonal working capital
requirements was partially offset by a signing bonus received from HSBC during the second quarter
in connection with the execution of a RAL distribution agreement. The signing bonus was recorded as
deferred revenue at January 31, 2006. This segment also used $49.2 million in investing activities,
primarily related to capital expenditures and acquisitions.

Mortgage Services.  This segment primarily generates cash as a result of the sale and
securitization of mortgage loans and residual interests, and as its residual interests begin to
cash flow. Mortgage Services used $349.3 million in cash from operating activities primarily due to
a $192.0 million increase in mortgage loans held for sale at January 31, 2006. Additionally, net
additions to MSRs totaled $95.8 million and servicing advances increased $61.5 million. Cash flows
from investing activities consist of $74.9 million in cash receipts on residual interests and $30.5
million in cash received for the sale of residual interests, partially offset by $32.9 million in
capital expenditures.

Warehouse funding. To finance our prime originations, we utilize an on-balance
sheet warehouse facility with capacity up to $25 million. This annual facility bears interest at
one-month LIBOR plus 140 to 200 basis points. As of January 31, 2006 and April 30, 2005, the
balance outstanding under this facility was $0.4 million and $4.4 million, respectively.

To fund our non-prime originations, we utilize nine off-balance sheet warehouse Trusts. The
facilities used by the Trusts had a total committed capacity of $15.0 billion as of January 31,
2006. Amounts drawn on the facilities by the Trusts totaled $11.2 billion at January 31, 2006. See
additional discussion below in  Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements. 

We believe the sources of liquidity available to the Mortgage Services segment are sufficient
for its needs.

Business Services.  Business Services funding requirements are largely related to receivables
for completed work and  work in process.  We provide funding sufficient to cover their working
capital needs. This segment provided $5.3 million in operating cash flows during the first nine
months of the year. Business Services used $220.4 million in investing activities primarily related
to the American Express Tax and Business Services, Inc. acquisition and, to a lesser extent,
capital expenditures.

Investment Services.  Investment Services, through HRBFA, is subject
to regulatory requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of
broker-dealers. At
January 31, 2006, HRBFA s net capital of $117.6 million, which was 20.1% of aggregate debit items,
exceeded its minimum required net capital of $11.7 million by $105.9 million.

-42-

Table of Contents   

In the first nine months of fiscal year 2006, Investment Services provided $14.7 million in
cash from its operating activities primarily due to working capital changes, including the timing
of cash deposits that are restricted for the benefit of customers.

Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin-borrowing activities are met primarily
through cash balances in client brokerage accounts and working capital. We believe these sources of
funds will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for Investment Services. Stock loans
have historically been used as a secondary source of funding and could be used in the future, if
warranted.

Pledged securities at January 31, 2006 totaled $51.9 million, an excess of $11.7 million over
the margin requirement. Pledged securities at the end of fiscal year 2005 totaled $44.6 million, an
excess of $7.9 million over the margin requirement.

We believe the funding sources for Investment Services are stable. Liquidity risk within this
segment is primarily limited to maintaining sufficient capital levels to obtain securities lending
liquidity to support margin borrowing by customers.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS 

Substantially all non-prime mortgage loans we originate are sold daily to the Trusts. The Trusts
purchase the loans from us utilizing nine warehouse facilities that were arranged by us, bear
interest at one-month LIBOR plus 45 to 400 basis points and expire on various dates during the
year. During the third quarter, the warehouse facilities were increased from $13.5 billion to $15.0
billion. An additional uncommitted facility of $1.5 billion brings total capacity to $16.5 billion.

There have been no other material changes in our off-balance sheet financing arrangements from
those reported at April 30, 2005 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A.

COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCE AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS 

We maintain two unsecured CLOCs for working capital, support of our commercial paper program and
general corporate purposes. In August 2005, the first CLOC expired and was replaced with a new $1.0
billion CLOC, which expires in August 2010. Also in August 2005, the second CLOC was extended, and
now expires in August 2010. These CLOCs were undrawn at January 31, 2006.

We obtained an additional $900.0 million line of credit for the period of January 3 to
February 24, 2006 to back-up peak commercial paper issuance or use as an alternate source of
funding for RAL participations. This line is subject to various covenants, substantially similar to
the primary CLOCs. The balance outstanding on this facility at January 31, 2006 was $550.0 million.

There have been no other material changes in our commercial paper program from those reported
at April 30, 2005 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS 

As
a result of our failure to file this Form 10-Q by the SEC s

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 

In this report, and from time to time throughout the year, we share our expectations for our future
performance. These forward-looking statements are based upon current information, expectations,
estimates and projections regarding the Company, the industries and markets in which we operate,
and our assumptions and beliefs at that time. These statements speak only as of the date on which
they are made, are not guarantees of future performance, and involve certain risks, uncertainties
and assumptions, which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results could
materially differ from what is expressed, implied or forecast in these forward-looking statements.
Words such as  believe,   will,   plan,   expect,   intend,   estimate,   approximate,  and similar

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
However, we believe certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios used in managing the business
may provide additional meaningful comparisons between current year results and prior periods, by
excluding certain items that do not represent results from our basic operations. Reconciliations to
GAAP financial measures are provided below. These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in

There have been no material changes in our market risks from those reported at April 30, 2005
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

We have established disclosure controls and procedures (Disclosure Controls) to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure Controls are
also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management,
including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our Disclosure Controls were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the controls and
procedures would meet their objectives. Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our Disclosure Controls will prevent all error and
all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving the designed control objectives and management is required to apply its
judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been
detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be
faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls
can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusions of two or more people, or
by
management override of the control. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective,
maturing control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

-44-

Table of Contents   

As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, we evaluated the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our Disclosure Controls. The controls evaluation was done under the
supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, and included consideration of the material weakness initially disclosed in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended April 30, 2005. Based on this evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our Disclosure Controls and
procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q because of the material weakness described below.

As disclosed initially in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended April 30, 2005,
management identified a material weakness in our accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the
Company did not maintain sufficient resources in the corporate tax function to accurately identify,
evaluate and report, in a timely manner, non-routine and complex transactions. In addition, the
Company had not completed the requisite historical analysis and related reconciliations to ensure
tax balances were appropriately stated prior to the completion of the Company s April 30, 2005
internal control activities.

In February 2006, as a result of the ongoing controls and procedural work to remediate the
material weakness in the Company s internal controls over accounting for income taxes as of April
30, 2005, management discovered additional income tax errors which required the restatement of
prior periods. In preparation for its 10-Q filing, management reviewed this disclosure and believes
it accurately describes the nature of the internal control deficiencies that contributed to the
material weakness as of April 30, 2005.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

In order to remediate the aforementioned material weakness, management completed the requisite
historical analysis including creation of the necessary tax basis balance sheets and current and
deferred reconciliations required and related internal control testing to ensure propriety of all
tax related financial statement account balances as of the Form 10-K/A filing date. The Company
believes it established appropriate controls and procedures and created appropriate tax account
analysis and support subsequent to April 30, 2005.

Additionally, in our efforts to remediate the material weakness management has engaged a
third-party firm to assist us in performing a comprehensive evaluation of the corporate tax
function, including resource requirements. Since August 1, 2005, we have hired a Senior Vice
President   Corporate Tax, an Income Tax Accounting Manager, a Corporate Tax Manager and two
additional Tax Analysts. In addition to implementing management s action plan addressing items from
the comprehensive evaluation, we will continue to monitor the improvements in the controls over
accounting for income taxes to ensure remediation of the material weakness.

Other than the changes outlined above, there were no changes that materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

The information below should be read in conjunction with the information included in note 12
to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

RAL LITIGATION 

We reported in current reports on Form 8-K, previous quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and in our
annual report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended April 30, 2005, certain events and information
regarding lawsuits throughout the country regarding our refund anticipation loan programs
(collectively,  RAL Cases ). The RAL Cases have involved a variety of legal theories asserted by
plaintiffs. These theories include allegations that, among other things, disclosures in the RAL
applications were inadequate, misleading and untimely; the RAL interest rates were usurious and
unconscionable; we did not disclose that we would receive part of the finance charges paid by the
customer for such loans; breach of state laws on credit service organizations; breach of contract,
unjust enrichment, unfair and deceptive acts or practices; violations of the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act; violations of the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act; and breach of fiduciary duty to our customers in connection with the RAL program.

The amounts claimed in the RAL Cases have been very substantial in some instances. We have
successfully defended against numerous RAL Cases, although several of the RAL Cases are still
pending. Of the RAL Cases that are no longer pending, some were dismissed on our motions for
dismissal or summary judgment, and others were dismissed voluntarily by the plaintiffs after denial
of class certification. Other cases have been settled, with one settlement resulting in a pretax
expense of $43.5 million in fiscal year 2003 (the  Texas RAL Settlement ). On December 21, 2005, we
entered into a settlement agreement, subject to final court approval, regarding four RAL Cases
entitled  Deadra D. Cummins, et al .  v. H R Block ,  Inc. et al. ;  Mitchell v. H R Block, Inc. et al. ;
 Green v. H R Block, Inc. et al. ; and  Becker v. H R Block, Inc.  (the   Cummins  Settlement
Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the  Cummins  Settlement Agreement, we will contribute a total
of up to $62.5 million in cash for purposes of making payments to the settlement class, paying all
attorneys  fees and costs to class counsel and covering service awards to the representative
plaintiffs. In addition, we will pay costs for providing notice of the settlement to settlement
class members. We recorded a reserve of $52.2 million related to this settlement in our third
quarter.

We believe we have meritorious defenses to the RAL Cases and we intend to defend the remaining
RAL Cases vigorously. There can be no assurances, however, as to the outcome of the pending RAL
Cases individually or in the aggregate. Likewise, there can be no assurances regarding the impact
of the RAL Cases on our financial statements. We have accrued our best estimate of the probable
loss related to the RAL Cases. The following is updated information regarding the pending RAL Cases
that are class actions or putative class actions in which developments occurred during or after the
three months ended January 31, 2006:

Lynne A. Carnegie, et al. v. Household International, Inc., H R Block, Inc., et al ., (formerly
Joel E. Zawikowski, et al. v. Beneficial National Bank, H R Block, Inc., Block Financial
Corporation, et al.) Case No. 98 C 2178, United States District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois, Eastern Division, instituted on April 18, 1998. In March 2004, the court either dismissed
or decertified all of the plaintiffs  claims other than part of one count alleging violations of
the racketeering and conspiracy provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act. On January 23, 2006, the court granted our motion for partial summary judgment applying a
four-year RICO statute of limitations to the plaintiffs  claims, reducing the class period to
primarily the 1995 and 1996 tax seasons and reducing the class size to approximately 1.7 million
members. This class action case is scheduled to go to trial on May 15, 2006. We intend to continue
defending the case vigorously, but there are no assurances as to its outcome. We have, however,
engaged in settlement discussions with counsel for the plaintiffs and, while no definitive
agreement has been reached, plan to pursue those negotiations to either conclusion or take the
matter to trial. During the quarter ended January 31, 2006, we increased our legal reserves related
to this matter by $19.5 million in connection with these developments.

Deadra D. Cummins, et al. v. H R Block, Inc., et al ., Case No. 03-C-134 in the Circuit Court
of Kanawha County, West Virginia, instituted on January 22, 2003. This case is stayed and will be
resolved as part of the  Cummins  Settlement Agreement, subject to final approval.

Joyce Green, et al. v. H R Block, Inc., Block Financial Corporation, et al. , Case No.
97195023, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, instituted on July 14, 1997. This case
is stayed and will be resolved as part of the  Cummins  Settlement Agreement, subject to final
approval.

Levon and Geral Mitchell, et al. v. H R Block,, Inc. and Ruth Wren,  Case No. CV-95-2067, in
the Circuit Court of Mobile County, Alabama, instituted on June 13, 1995. This case is stayed and
will be resolved as part of the  Cummins  Settlement Agreement, subject to final approval.

Lynn Becker v. H R Block, Inc.,  Case No. CV-2004-03-1680 in the Court of Common Pleas, Summit
County, Ohio, Instituted on April 15, 2004. This case is stayed and will be resolved as part of
the  Cummins  Settlement Agreement, subject to final approval.

On February 15, 2006, the California attorney general filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of
California, City and County of San Francisco entitled  The People of California v. H R Block, Inc.,
H R Block Services, Inc., H R Block Enterprises, Inc., H R Block Tax Services, Inc., Block
Financial Corporation, HRB Royalty, Inc. and Does 1 through 50 . The complaint alleges, among
other things, untrue, misleading or deceptive statements in marketing RALS and unfair competition
with respect to debt collection activities. The complaint seeks equitable relief, civil penalties
and restitution. We intend to defend the case vigorously, but there are no assurances as to its
outcome.

PEACE OF MIND LITIGATION 

Lorie J. Marshall, et al. v. H R Block Tax Services, Inc., et al ., Civil Action 2003L000004, in the
Circuit Court of Madison County, Illinois, is a class action case filed on January 18, 2002, that
was granted class certification on August 27, 2003. Plaintiffs  claims consist of five counts
relating to the Peace of Mind (POM) program under which the applicable tax return preparation
subsidiary assumes liability for additional tax assessments attributable to tax return preparation
error. The plaintiffs allege that the sale of POM guarantees constitutes (i) statutory fraud by
selling insurance without a license, (ii) an unfair trade practice, by omission and by  cramming 
( i.e. , charging customers for the guarantee even though they did not request it or want it), and
(iii) a breach of fiduciary duty. In August 2003, the court certified the plaintiff classes
consisting of all persons who from January 1, 1997 to final judgment (i) were charged a separate
fee for POM by  H R Block  or a defendant H R Block class member; (ii) reside in certain class
states and were charged a separate fee for POM by  H R Block  or a defendant H R Block class member
not licensed to sell insurance; and (iii) had an unsolicited charge for POM posted to their bills
by  H R Block  or a defendant H R Block class member. Persons who received the POM guarantee
through an H R Block Premium office and persons who reside in Alabama are excluded from the
plaintiff class. The court also certified a defendant class consisting of any entity with names
that include  H R Block  or  HRB,  or are otherwise affiliated or associated with H R Block Tax
Services, Inc., and that sold or sells the POM product. The trial court subsequently denied the
defendants  motion to certify class certification issues for interlocutory appeal. Discovery is
proceeding. No trial date has been set.

There is one other putative class action pending against us in Texas that involves the POM
guarantee. This case is being tried before the same judge that presided over the Texas RAL
Settlement, involves the same plaintiffs  attorneys that are involved in the Marshall litigation in
Illinois, and contains similar allegations. No class has been certified in this case.

We believe the claims in the POM action are without merit, and we intend to defend them
vigorously. The amounts claimed in the POM actions are substantial, however, and there can be no
assurances as to the outcome of these pending actions individually or in the aggregate. Likewise,
there can be no assurances regarding the impact of these actions on our consolidated financial
statements.

OTHER CLAIMS AND LITIGATION 

As reported previously, the NASD brought charges against HRBFA regarding the sale by HRBFA of
Enron debentures in 2001. A hearing for this matter is scheduled for May 2, 2006. We intend to
defend the NASD charges vigorously, although there can be no assurances regarding the outcome and
resolution of the matter.

As part of an industry-wide review, the IRS is investigating tax-planning strategies that
certain RSM clients utilized during fiscal years 2000 through 2003. Specifically, the IRS is
examining these strategies to determine whether RSM complied with tax shelter registration and
listing regulations and whether such strategies were appropriate. If the IRS were to determine that
these strategies were inappropriate, clients that utilized the strategies could face penalties and
interest for underpayment of taxes. Some of these clients are seeking or may attempt to seek
recovery from

RSM. While there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of these matters, we do not believe its
resolution will have a material adverse effect on our operations or consolidated financial
statements.

On March 15, 2006, the New York Attorney General filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York entitled  The People of New York v. H R Block, Inc. and H R
Block Financial Services, Inc.  The complaint alleges fraudulent business practices, deceptive
acts and practices, common law fraud and breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the Express IRA
product. The complaint seeks equitable relief, disgorgement of profits, damages and restitution,
civil penalties and punitive damages. A number of civil actions were subsequently filed against us
concerning the matter. We intend to defend these cases vigorously, but there are no assurances as
to their outcome.

On or about March 16, 2006, two shareholder derivative actions were initiated against the
Board of Directors and certain company officers. The cases involve claims that the defendants
failed to properly manage certain company activities resulting in a restatement of financial
results due to state tax miscalculations. These cases are pending in the Circuit Court of Jackson
County, Missouri and are styled  Priscilla Fisk v. Mark A. Ernst, Jeffrey E. Nachbor, William L.
Trubeck, Melanie K. Coleman, Frank J. Cotroneo, Thomas M. Bloch, Donna R. Ecton, Henry F. Frigon,
Roger W. Hale, Len J. Lauer, David Baker Lewis, Tom D. Seip, Louis W. Smith, Ray Wilkins Jr. and
Kenneth Baum . The plaintiff in the second action is Robert Lang. The named defendants in the  Lang 
matter are the same as in  Fisk . We intend to defend these cases vigorously, but there are no
assurances as to their outcome.

Subsequent to February 2006, a number of putative
class actions alleging violations of certain securities laws were filed. The actions seek
unspecified damages and equitable relief. We intend to defend these cases vigorously, but there are
no assurances as to its outcome.

We have from time to time been party to claims and lawsuits not discussed herein arising out
of our business operations. These claims and lawsuits include actions by state attorneys general,
individual plaintiffs, and cases in which plaintiffs seek to represent a class of similarly
situated customers. The amounts claimed in these claims and lawsuits are substantial in some
instances, and the ultimate liability with respect to such litigation and claims is difficult to
predict. Some of these claims and lawsuits pertain to RALs, the electronic filing of customers 
income tax returns, the POM guarantee program and our Express IRA program. We believe we have
meritorious defenses to each of these claims, and we are defending or intend to defend them
vigorously, although there is no assurance as to their outcome.

In addition to the aforementioned types of cases, we are parties to claims and lawsuits that
we consider to be ordinary, routine litigation incidental to our business, including claims and
lawsuits ( Other Claims ) concerning investment products, the preparation of customers  income tax
returns, the fees charged customers for various products and services, losses incurred by customers
with respect to their investment accounts, relationships with franchisees, denials of mortgage
loans, contested mortgage foreclosures, other aspects of the mortgage business, intellectual
property disputes, employment matters and contract disputes. We believe we have meritorious
defenses to each of the Other Claims, and we are defending them vigorously. While we cannot provide
assurance that we will ultimately prevail in each instance, we believe the amount, if any, we are
required to pay in the discharge of liabilities or settlements in these Other Claims will not have
a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

 AGREEMENT OF SETTLEMENT

Exhibit 10.5

AGREEMENT OF SETTLEMENT 

NOTE: CERTAIN MATERIAL HAS BEEN OMITTED FROM THIS AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT UNDER RULE 24b-2. THE LOCATIONS OF THESE OMISSIONS ARE INDICATED THROUGHOUT
THE AGREEMENT BY THE FOLLOWING MARKINGS:  *** .

This Agreement of Settlement (together with all appendices, exhibits, schedules and
attachments hereto, the  Agreement ), dated as of this 23 rd  day of December, 2005, is
made by and among; H R Block, Inc., H R Block Services, Inc., H R Block Tax Services, Inc., Block
Financial Corp., HRB Royalty, Inc., and H R Block Eastern Enterprise, Inc., successor to H R Block
Eastern Tax Services, Inc., for themselves and all persons or entities acting on their behalf or at
their direction (collectively, the  Settling Defendants ), on the one hand, and Deadra D. Cummins,
Ivan and LaDonna Bell, Levon Mitchell, Geral Mitchell, Joyce Green, Lynn Becker, Justin Sevey,
Maryanne Hoekman, and Renea Griffith ( Plaintiffs ), on behalf of themselves individually and on
behalf of the respective Settlement Classes they seek to represent, as defined in Section II,
Paragraph 2, on the other hand (all of the foregoing mentioned in this sentence, the  Parties ).
This Agreement is intended by the Settling Parties to fully, finally and forever compromise,
resolve, discharge and settle the Released Claims subject to the terms and conditions set forth
below.

I. CLAIMS OF THE PARTIES 

1. The Settling Defendants and/or their Affiliates have been involved, together and
separately, in facilitating Refund Anticipation Loans ( RALs ) at some point from at least 1992 to
the present. A RAL is a patented method by which tax customers, for a fee, can take a loan that is
secured by and expected to be repaid from the anticipated proceeds of their tax refunds.

2. On January 22, 2003, a class action was filed in the Circuit Court of Kanawha

County (the  Court ) against some of the Settling Defendants captioned  Deadra D. Cummins, et
al. v. H   R Block, Inc., et al. (Civil Action No. 03-C-134)  (the    Cummins Action ). A Second
Amended Complaint was filed on October 22, 2004. The Second Amended Complaint alleged that the
Settling Defendants, among others, violated the West Virginia credit service organization statute,
W. Va.   46A-6C-1 et seq.,
breached fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs, violated the West Virginia Consumer Credit and
Protection Act, breached their contractual obligations to plaintiffs and were unjustly enriched. On
December 30, 2004, the Court appointed Ms. Cummins, Ivan Bell and LaDonna Bell as class
representatives and Brian Glasser of Bailey   Glasser, LLP, class counsel ( Coordinating Counsel ).
The Court certified a class in the Cummins Action that included all West Virginia residents who
obtained Refund Anticipation Loans through any  H R Block  office in West Virginia from January 1,
1994 to December 31, 2004, as to all claims contained in the plaintiffs  Second Amended Complaint.
A copy of the class certification order is attached as Exhibit A.

3. On June 13, 1995, a class action was filed in the Circuit Court of Mobile City,
Alabama against some of the Settling Defendants captioned as  Mitchell v. H R Block, Inc. et al. ,
Case No. CV-95-2067 (Circuit Court of Mobile City, Ala.) (the  Mitchell Action ). The plaintiffs
allege that certain of the Settling Defendants herein breached fiduciary duties to plaintiffs,
breached their contractual obligations to plaintiffs and were unjustly enriched by offering RALs.
On July 11, 2003, the Court appointed Levon Mitchell and Geral Mitchell as class representatives.
The Court appointed Steve Martino, W. Lloyd Copeland of Taylor, Martino   Hedge, PC; Michael B.
Hyman of Much, Shelist, Freed, Denenberg, Ament   Rubenstein; and Steven E. Angstreich of Levy,
Angstreich, Finney, Baldante, Rubenstein and Coren, P.C., as class counsel in the Mitchell Action.
The Court certified two classes in the

2

Mitchell Action as follows (i) Breach of Fiduciary Duty/Unjust Enrichment Subclass: all
individuals who obtained Refund Anticipation Loans from June 13, 1993 through December 31, 1996
through any  H R Block  office in Alabama for which the Settling Defendants herein received a
license fee payment or portion of the finance charge; (ii) Breach of Contract Subclass: all
individuals who obtained Refund Anticipation Loans from June 13, 1989 through December 31, 1996
through any  H R Block  office in Alabama for which the Settling Defendants herein received a
license fee payment or portion of the finance charge. A copy of the class certification order is
attached as Exhibit B. The Mitchell Action has not been set for trial. A class certification ruling
is on appeal.

4. On July 14, 1997, a class action was filed in the Circuit Court of Baltimore
City, Maryland against some of the Settling Defendants captioned as  Green v. H R Block, Inc. et
al ., Case No. 97195023/CC411 (Circuit Court of Baltimore City, Maryland) (the  Green Action ). The
plaintiff alleges that certain of the Settling Defendants herein violated the Maryland Consumer
Protection Act, engaged in fraudulent concealment and negligent misrepresentations, and breached
fiduciary duties and duties of good faith and fair dealing allegedly owed to plaintiff by offering
RALs. On May 19, 2000, the Court appointed Joyce A. Green as class representative. The Court
appointed Charles J. Piven of Baltimore, Maryland; Steve Martino, W. Lloyd Copeland of Taylor,
Martino   Hedge, PC; Michael B. Hyman of Much, Shelist, Freed, Denenberg, Ament   Rubenstein;
Steven E. Angstreich of Levy, Angstreich, Finney, Baldante, Rubenstein and Coren, P.C.; and Roger
Kirby of Kirby, McInerney   Squire as class counsel in the Green Action. Through the original
order, and an order modifying the class definition on July 10, 2002, the Court certified a class of
all persons whose income taxes were prepared at any  H R Block  office or facility in Maryland who
obtained a RAL at any time from January 1,

3

1992 to December 31, 1996, and did not later apply for and receive a RAL through an
application that contained a retroactive arbitration clause. A copy of the class certification
order, and the order modifying it, are attached, collectively, as Exhibit C. The Green Action has
been set for trial in May 2006.

5. On March 19, 2004, a class action was filed in the Court of Common Pleas for
Summit County, Ohio against some of the Settling Defendants captioned as  Becker v. H R Block, Inc .,
Case No. 5:04-cv-01074-CAB (N.D. Ohio) (removed from Summit County (Ohio) Court of Common Pleas)
(the  Becker Action ). Plaintiff Lynn Becker alleges that some of the Settling Defendants herein
violated the Ohio credit services organization statute and the Ohio Consumer Protection Act. The
plaintiff purports to represent a class of Ohio residents who, from March 19, 2000 to present,
obtained a RAL through any  H R Block  office in Ohio. Plaintiff s Motion to Remand, and
Defendants  motion to dismiss and Defendants  motion to compel arbitration, are pending and
unresolved as of the date of this Agreement.

6. The cases identified in paragraphs 2 through 5 will be referred to in this
Agreement collectively as  the Settling Cases.  The plaintiffs in the Settling Cases will be
referred to collectively as  Plaintiffs. 

7. This Settlement Agreement encompasses four distinct Settlement Classes. To
simplify settlement administration and obtain economies of scale the parties negotiated uniform
elements of settlement which apply to all of the Settlement Classes, as well as class specific
elements.

8. The parties have consolidated these uniform and class specific elements within
this Settlement Agreement. Plaintiffs will similarly submit consolidated filings upon application
for preliminary and final approval.

4

9. Plaintiffs will jointly move for leave to file a Consolidated and Amended
Complaint in the Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia, with such request for leave to
file being expressly conditioned upon the concurrent entry of an order granting preliminary
approval of this Agreement (the  Preliminary Approval Order  described below in Section X), which
order will provide that in the event that the Circuit Court determines not to grant final approval
of this Agreement or of any respective settlement class it contains, such Consolidated and Amended
Complaint or affected portion thereof will be stricken (i) concurrently with any order rejecting
approval of this Agreement or of any respective settlement class it contains, or (ii) in the event
that the Circuit Court grants final approval of this Agreement or of any respective settlement
class it contains but such final approval order is subsequently reversed or modified on appeal,
concurrently with any order remanding the case to the Circuit Court, in either case without the
need for any further order of the Circuit Court. This Agreement will be presented for preliminary
review and approval in the Circuit Court simultaneously with the request for leave to file the
proposed Consolidated and Amended Complaint. The Settling Defendants consent to the filing of the
proposed Consolidated and Amended Complaint subject to all applicable conditions herein, including
the striking thereof or any affected portion thereof in the event that the Settlement does not
become final with respect to any settlement class for any reason.

10. With respect to Settling Cases pending in other courts, the parties to those
respective cases will inform their respective courts of the existence of this Agreement and hereby
consent to the respective courts either placing the cases on the inactive docket, staying discovery
or otherwise taking whatever action such courts find best serves the efficient administration of
justice while this proposed settlement is being reviewed for approval.

11. Over the past several years, Class Counsel have conducted an investigation of the

5

facts, including reviews of over 300,000 of the Settling Defendants  relevant documents and
more than 50 depositions of the Settling Defendants  representatives, and analyzed the relevant
legal issues. While Plaintiffs and Class Counsel believe that the claims asserted in their
respective complaints have merit, they have also examined the benefits to be obtained under the
proposed settlement and have considered the costs, risks and delays associated with the continued
prosecution of this time-consuming litigation and the likely appeals of any rulings in favor of
either Plaintiffs or the Settling Defendants. Plaintiffs desire to resolve the claims asserted
against the Settling Defendants.

12. Plaintiffs and their Class Counsel believe that, in consideration of all the
circumstances and after prolonged and serious arms-length settlement negotiations with counsel for
the Settling Defendants, the proposed settlement embodied in this Agreement is fair, reasonable,
adequate and in the best interests of the Settlement Class.

13. The Settling Defendants have vigorously denied, and continue to deny, all
liability with respect to any and all of the facts or claims alleged in the complaints filed in the
Cummins, Mitchell, Green and Becker actions, deny that they engaged in any wrongdoing, deny that
they acted improperly in any way ,  and deny any liability to Plaintiffs, any member of the
Settlement Class, or any third party. The Settling Defendants nevertheless desire to settle
Plaintiffs  claims on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement solely for the purpose
of avoiding the burden, expense, risk and uncertainty of continuing the proceedings in currently
pending actions, and for the purpose of putting to rest all controversies among the Parties. In no
event is this Agreement to be construed as, or is to be deemed evidence of, an admission
or concession on the part of the Settling Defendants or Released Parties (as defined herein)
with respect to: any claim by Plaintiffs and the Settlement Class; any fault, liability, wrongdoing
or

6

damage; the merits of any defenses that the Settling Defendants asserted; or the propriety of
class certification of the Settlement Class if the Action were to be litigated rather than settled.

14. Mediation in the  Cummins  action was initially unsuccessful in February 2004. In
the Summer of 2005, Class Counsel began to explore the possibility of further mediation.
Thereafter, Class Counsel and counsel for the Settling Defendants commenced formal settlement
negotiations on August 15, 2005, that took place in face-to-face mediation sessions with Thomas
Meites, a mediator suggested to the Parties by United States District Judge Elaine Bucklo, the
presiding judge in  Carnegie v. Household International et al. , 98 C 2178 (N.D. Ill.) (the   Carnegie 
Action ), a separate case not affected by this proposed Agreement, with mediation sessions
conducted on August 15, 16, 29 and September 8, 2005. The Parties thereafter conducted extensive
arms -length negotiations in numerous negotiation sessions.

15. The Parties intend that the proposed settlement embodied in this Agreement
resolve all the claims and disputes between Plaintiffs, Settlement Class Members, the Settling
Defendants, and all Released Parties with respect to the Released Claims.

claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time

Civil Code or any comparable law of any state or territory of the United States, or principle of
common law, which is similar, comparable or equivalent to   1542 of the California Civil Code. All
persons or entities providing releases under this Agreement may hereafter discover facts other than
or different from those which he, she or it now knows or believes to be true with respect to the

deemed to have, and by operation of the Final Order in the Action shall have, fully, finally, and
forever settled and released any and all such claims, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected,
contingent or non-contingent, whether or not concealed or hidden, which now exist, or heretofore
have existed upon any theory of law or equity now existing or coming into existence in the future,
including conduct which is negligent, intentional, with or without malice, or a breach of any duty,
law or rule, without regard to the subsequent discovery or existence of such different or
additional facts.

III. CERTIFICATION OF CLASS FOR SETTLEMENT PURPOSES ONLY 

For settlement purposes only, the Parties agree that, as part of the preliminary approval
process, the Court may make preliminary findings and enter an order granting provisional
certification of the respective Settlement Classes subject to final findings and certification in
the Final Order, and appointing both Plaintiffs and Class Counsel as representatives of the
proposed Settlement Classes. For settlement purposes only, the respective Settlement Classes are
certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) of the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure.  The Settling
Defendants do not consent to certification of the respective
Settlement Classes, or to the filing of the proposed Consolidated and Amended Complaint, for
any purpose other than to effectuate the 

15

settlement of the actions and claims identified in this Agreement. If one or more of the
Settlement Classes contained in this Agreement is not approved by the Court or is terminated
pursuant to its terms or for any other reason, or is disapproved in a final order by any court of
competent jurisdiction, (a) the order certifying the disapproved Settlement Class and all
preliminary and/or final findings or stipulations regarding certification of such disapproved
Settlement Class shall be automatically vacated upon notice to the Court of that portion of this
Agreement s termination or disapproval and in such instance, the disapproved Settlement Class shall
proceed as indicated: (i) the Cummins Action may proceed with the West Virginia merits class
previously certified by the Court as of December 30, 2004, and as though the Settlement Class had
never been certified and any related findings or stipulations pursuant to this agreement had never
been made; or (ii) the Mitchell Action may proceed with the merits class previously certified by
the court as of July 11, 2003, including the appeal of class certification, and as though the
Settlement Class had never been certified and any related findings or stipulations had never been
made; or (iii) the Green Action may proceed with the merits class previously certified by the court
as of May 19, 2000, and as though the Settlement Class had never been certified and any related
findings or stipulations had never been made; and (b) the Plaintiffs will withdraw their motion for
leave to file the proposed Consolidated and Amended Complaint in its present form and, if already
filed, portions of the Consolidated and Amended Complaint related to the disapproved Settlement
Class will be stricken pursuant to the terms of the order related to its filing; and (c) the
Parties reserve all procedural or substantive rights as presently exist, including all affirmative
defenses, in all RAL litigation pending as of the date of execution of this Agreement, including
but not limited to, the Becker Action and Basile v. H R Block, No. 9304-3246 (Court of Common Pleas
for Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania). 

16

IV. SETTLEMENT CONSIDERATION 

1. ECONOMIC RELIEF.

(a) The Settling Defendants will contribute up to $62.5 million in cash, by wire
transfer, to be used for purposes of making payments to Settlement Class Members (the  Settlement
Fund ), paying for all attorneys  fees and costs to Class Counsel, and covering service awards to
representative Plaintiffs. This is substantially an  all-in  payment.

(b) The Settlement Fund will be held in one account, the interest on which account
will accrue first to the benefit of the Settlement Fund. The account will be held at a major bank
agreed to by the Coordinating Counsel and Counsel for the Settling Defendants and approved by the
Court and shall be under the joint control of the Settling Defendants and Coordinating Counsel.

(c) The Settling Defendants will not be required to make any additional payments to
or on behalf of the Settlement Class Members for any purpose whatsoever, except for the Notice
Costs substantially conforming to the proposed notice plan set forth in Section X, Paragraph 3,
which shall be paid separately by the Settling Defendants.

(d) Each Settlement Class Member who submits a timely, proper and undisputed Claim
Form as defined in Section XII, Paragraph 1 (a  Valid Claim ) will be entitled to a payment from
the Settlement Fund for each RAL that he or she obtained by or through the Settling Defendants or
their Affiliates for their claim. As provided in Section IV, Paragraph 1(g), the amount paid to
individual Settlement Class Members will be calculated on a pro-rata basis (based on each
Settlement Class Member s total claim for all RALs previously obtained during the respective
Settlement Class Member s Settlement Class Period) from the cash funds remaining in the Settlement
Fund after deduction for all items to be paid for from the Settlement

17

Fund under this Agreement, including Administration Costs, service fees, and attorneys  fees
and costs awarded to Class Counsel. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Settlement Class Member has
previously released his or her claims for any RAL or RALs covered by any prior individual or class
settlement with
any of the Settling Defendants, such person cannot recover any further cash payment from the
Settlement Fund with respect to such settled RAL or RALs under the terms of this Paragraph, but he
or she will still be entitled to receive payments under the terms of this Paragraph solely with
respect to any other non-settled RALs he or she may have obtained, on the same terms and conditions
as applicable to other Settlement Class Members.

(e) In the event that a RAL was issued to joint borrowers and a Valid Claim is
submitted with respect to such RAL, such couple or joint interest shall be treated as one
Settlement Class Member for all purposes under this Agreement; provided, however, that if the joint
borrowers are contesting the entitlement of the other to the settlement consideration, each joint
borrower will be entitled to one half of the settlement consideration with respect to such RAL.
Settlement Class Members who are joint RAL borrowers waive any and all claims against the
Settlement Administrator and the Released Parties with regard to payments made to joint RAL
borrowers.

(f) The Settling Defendants will contribute the amount required to the Settlement
Fund no later than 31 days after the Court s entry of the Final Order, or the Effective Date,
whichever occurs first. No payments will be made to or on behalf of the Settlement Class Members
until at least 60 days after the Effective Date. In the event that the settlement does not become
final and the Effective Date does not occur for any reason, this amount, together with all accrued
interest, shall promptly be returned to the Settling Defendants by either transfer of the ownership
of the account or wire transfer.

18

(g) The Settlement Fund shall be distributed to class members as follows: (i)
$32.5 million of the Settlement Fund shall be paid as attorneys  fees and costs to Class Counsel in
the West Virginia Cummins Class, service awards to representative Plaintiffs in the West Virginia
Cummins Class,  pro rata  Administration Costs of the Settlement Fund attributable to the West
Virginia Class, and further consideration to members of the West Virginia Class not to exceed $175
per RAL (after attorneys  fees and expenses and Administration Costs attributable to West Virginia)
on a  pro rata  basis; and (ii) a total of up to $30 million of the Settlement Fund shall be paid to
members of the other classes in this action as
attorneys  fees and costs for their Class Counsel, service awards to representative Plaintiffs
in such other classes,  pro rata  Administration Costs of the Settlement Fund attributable to these
other classes, and further consideration on a  pro rata  basis to such other class members in the
amounts outlined on the chart attached as Exhibit F. A class member s right to a settlement payment
pursuant to this Agreement is a conditional right that terminates if a class member to whom the
Administrator mailed a settlement payment fails to cash his or her check within six months of its
mailing date. In such case the check shall be null and void (the checks shall be stamped or printed
with a legend to that effect) and the Administrator and the Parties shall have no further
obligation under the terms of this Agreement to make payment to such class member, with such amount
reverting to the Settlement Fund effective immediately upon the expiration of such six-month
period. The Administrator will provide to Coordinating Counsel and counsel for the Settling
Defendants and Coordinating Counsel will file with the Court a final accounting of the Settlement
Funds within 30 days after the latest date upon which class members  checks expire.

(h) In the event that there are any residual amounts that remain in the Settlement
Fund after the Effective Date and distribution pursuant to the terms of this

19

Agreement, the remaining amounts in the Settlement Fund shall be distributed to a charity or
charities or scientific or educational organizations pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code jointly proposed by the Plaintiffs and Settling Defendants and approved by the Court.
The Plaintiffs and Settling Defendants propose the West Virginia University College of Law. If that
proposal is disapproved and the parties are unable to reach agreement on another proposed charity,
then the Court shall designate a charitable organization to which the remaining amounts of the
Settlement Fund shall be distributed.

V. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND CONFIRMATORY DISCOVERY 

1. Settling Defendants represent and warrant that, to the best of their knowledge
and based in reliance on data obtained from Analytics Inc. and the RAL lenders, no more than
15,700,000 RALs are attributable to members of the Settlement Class (excluding only the RALs
attributable to the West Virginia Class). Should confirmatory discovery or other information prove
the stated number of RALs inaccurate,
Settling Defendants shall increase the Settlement Fund by a proportional amount equal to the
ratio between the total number of RALs and 15,700,000.

2. Settling Defendants further represent and warrant that, to the best of their
knowledge and based in reliance on data obtained from Analytics Inc. and the RAL lenders, no more
than 1,585,000 RALs are attributable to members of the Becker Class. Should confirmatory discovery
or other information prove the stated number of RALs inaccurate, Settling Defendants shall increase
the Settlement Fund attributable to the Becker Class by a proportional amount equal to the ratio
between the total number of RALs in Ohio and 1,585,000.

3. Settling Defendants further represent and warrant that, to the best of their
knowledge and based in reliance on data obtained from Analytics Inc. and the RAL lenders, no

20

more than 560,000 RALs are attributable to members of the Mitchell/Green Class. Should
confirmatory discovery or other information prove the stated number of RALs inaccurate, Settling
Defendants shall increase the Settlement Fund attributable to the Mitchell/Green Class by a
proportional amount equal to the ratio between the total number of RALs in the  Mitchell  and  Green 
cases and 560,000.

4. Prior to the date set for the preliminary approval hearing, the Settling
Defendants provided Class Counsel with a summary of the number of Settlement Class members in each
jurisdiction covered by this Agreement and the number of RALs within each such jurisdiction
obtained within the applicable class period. Prior to mailing any notice, Settling Defendants will
provide to Class Counsel an affirmation that the database has been checked against the National
Change of Address (NCOA) database.

5. Settling Defendants represent and warrant that (i) all  Peace of Mind  related
cases involving a class allegation with which they have been served or of which they are aware as
of the date of this Agreement, and (ii) all electronic filing related cases involving a class
allegation with which they have been served or of which they are aware as of the date of this
Agreement have been excluded from this Agreement, by name, in the definition of Excluded Claims.

6. Settling Defendants represent and warrant that all RAL-related cases involving a
class allegation with which they have been served or of which they are aware as of the date of this
Agreement
are either specifically identified in the Agreement and thereby proposed for settlement or
specifically excluded from this Agreement, by name, in the definition of Excluded Claims.

7. Subsequent to preliminary approval of this settlement, Coordinating Counsel may

21

conduct confirmatory discovery sufficient to assure that (1) the Settling Defendants 
representations and warranties that the Settlement Class encompasses a maximum of 15,700,000 RALs
are accurate; (2) the Settling Defendants  representations and warranties that the Becker Class
encompasses a maximum of 1,585,000 RALs are accurate; (3) the Settling Defendants  representations
and warranties that the Mitchell/Green Class encompasses a maximum of 560,000 RALs are accurate and
(4) Class Members have been properly identified. Coordinating counsel will accept affidavits as to
these subjects, and will conduct depositions only if the affidavits are insufficient and Settling
Defendants are unwilling or unable to supplement such affidavits to address deficiencies identified
by Coordinating Counsel. If a deposition(s) is conducted, Settling Defendants will produce a
knowledgeable person with respect to the three topics described above.

VI. BUSINESS PRACTICES 

1. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and all applicable state or federal law,
for the period from the date of this Agreement until two years following the date of entry of a
Final Order, (the  Time Period ) in connection with any RAL transaction, the Settling Defendants
and/or their Affiliates shall (a) substantially conform to the business practices set forth in
Appendix A to this Agreement, and (b) use RAL applications, agreements and other RAL forms in
substantially the form attached as Appendix B (the  RAL Forms ). So long as any of the Settling
Defendants and/or their Affiliates do not knowingly and materially fail to conform to such business
practices or use such RAL Forms during such Time Period, Plaintiffs and all Settlement Class
Members agree to release any Released Claims or other claims or actions for money damages or
equitable relief that they may have or be entitled to assert hereafter against such entities under
any legal theory concerning such business practices or RAL Forms either

22

directly, representatively, derivatively, or in any other capacity, in any local, state, or
federal court, or in any agency or authority or forum wherever located arising out of or related to
any new RAL transaction in such Time Period. However, if at the end of this Time Period the
Settling Defendants or their Affiliates (as applicable) have not registered as a Credit Service
Organization (a  CSO ) in a jurisdiction covered by this Agreement that requires or permits
registration as a CSO (or posted a bond in a state that requires or permits a bond) for persons who
assist consumers in obtaining an extension of credit under an applicable CSO statute, and have not
implemented the requirements of such CSO statute, (i) the release set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence by Members of the Settlement Class who reside in such jurisdiction shall be
deemed null and void in such jurisdiction, (ii) all Parties will be placed in their  status quo ante 
position with respect to any such new RAL transactions in such jurisdiction in such Time Period,
(iii) Settlement Class Members in such jurisdiction shall have all the all procedural or
substantive rights that they would otherwise have as of the day after the Effective Date of this
Agreement (and in addition shall be entitled to tolling of any applicable limitations period for
such Time Period), and (iv) the Settling Defendants will likewise have all the procedural or
substantive rights and defenses that they would otherwise have as of the day after the Effective
Date of this Agreement.

2. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Settling Defendants and/or their
Affiliates will begin implementation of the business practices set forth in Appendix A immediately
following the Effective Date. The Parties acknowledge that the RAL Forms are documents of the RAL
lender, and believe that the RAL Forms attached as Appendix B are reasonably acceptable to the RAL
lender and that the RAL lender will approve of their use, in which case the Settling Defendants
and/or their Affiliates will also begin implementation of the

23

use of the RAL Forms immediately following the Effective Date. However, if there are changes
in the applicable state or federal laws after the Effective Date and within the Time Period that
impact the business practices in Appendix A or the RAL Forms, or if the RAL lender within the Time
Period gives notice of a refusal to agree to the implementation and use of RAL Forms that
substantially conform to the
requirements of Paragraph (a) in all material respects, Coordinating Counsel for the Settlement
Class and the Settling Defendants agree to use their best efforts to negotiate together in good
faith to develop new business practices or, in the case of the RAL Forms, with the RAL lender to
develop revised RAL Forms, that in either case conform to the requirements of Paragraph (a) to the
extent reasonably practicable. In the event that Coordinating Counsel and the Settling Defendants
are not able to reach agreement with the RAL lender on revisions to the RAL Forms despite their
best good faith efforts, then (i) Coordinating Counsel and the Settling Defendants will use their
best efforts to determine how the revised disclosures that may be required can be conveyed to RAL
customers by means other than the RAL Forms used by the RAL lender (to the extent consistent with
the Settling Defendants  contractual obligations with the RAL lender), and (ii) the Settling
Defendants and their Affiliates shall be released from all requirements to use the specific RAL
Forms in Appendix B.

3. Nothing in Paragraph 1 above shall bar a Settlement Class Member who is a RAL
customer from asserting a claim to the extent that one or more of the Settling Defendants or their
Affiliates fail to perform their contractual obligations under the RAL Forms.

4. Nothing in this Section VI forecloses a Non-Opt Out s right to arbitrate a
Released Claim arising prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to Section VII, Paragraph 2.

5. Nothing in this Section VI shall be construed as a covenant on the part of the
Settling Defendants or their Affiliates to register as a CSO in any jurisdiction, but it should be

24

construed as an agreement on the part of the Settling Defendants to, in good faith, evaluate
their obligations under various CSO laws and comply with them to the extent applicable. This
Section VI is not an admission that any Settling Defendant or any Affiliate is or was at any time a
CSO. This Section VI is instead an inducement, available at the Settling Defendants  option, to
register as a CSO. In addition, a decision by any of the Settling Defendants and/or their
Affiliates not to register as a CSO in any particular jurisdiction(s) by the end of the Time Period
set forth in Paragraph (a) above shall not be or be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement or the
violation of any order related to this Agreement and the settlement contemplated herein in any
respect.

6. This Section VI is not intended to create a right or obligation on the part of
any Settlement Class Member to litigate any issue pursuant to this Section VI in the Circuit Court
of Kanawha County, West Virginia, nor is this Section VI intended to have the effect or character
of a Consent Decree. After the Time Period ends, the Settling Defendants have no further obligation
to consult Coordinating Counsel respecting changes to their business practices or RAL Forms. After
the Time Period ends, the release offered by Paragraph (b) will either be effective or not
effective in any given jurisdiction, as determined in the normal fashion by any tribunal of
competent jurisdiction.

VII. RELEASE BY SETTLEMENT CLASS MEMBERS 

1. In accordance with the provisions of the Final Order, for good and sufficient
consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, upon the Effective Date Plaintiffs and
each Settlement Class Member who receives money from the Settlement Fund shall be deemed to have,
and by operation of the Final Order shall have, fully, finally and forever released, relinquished
and discharged all Released Claims against the Released Parties.

2. Each Settlement Class Member who does not opt out of this settlement ( Non-Opt

25

Outs ), but for whatever reason does not receive money from the Settlement Fund, shall be
deemed to have and by operation of the Final Order shall have fully, finally and forever released
and extinguished his or her right (if any ever existed) to adjudicate a Released Claim in any forum
other than by individual arbitration as permitted by and in accordance with the arbitration
provision of the 2005 RAL application, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit G. In all other
respects, such Non-Opt Outs do not release any Released Claims for a period of one year after the
Effective Date, at which time such Non-Opt Outs shall be deemed to have, and by operation of the
Final Order shall have, fully, finally and forever released, relinquished and discharged all
Released Claims against the Released Parties.

3. In accordance with the provisions of the Final Order, for good and sufficient
consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, upon the Effective Date each of the
Released Parties and all signatories to this Agreement shall be deemed to have, and by operation of
the Final Order shall have, fully, finally and forever released, relinquished and discharged
Plaintiffs, Class Counsel, and the
Settling Defendants and their counsel in this Action from any claims (including Unknown
Claims) for abuse of process, libel, malicious prosecution or similar claims arising out of,
relating to, or in connection with the institution, prosecution, defense, assertion, or resolution
of the Action, including any right under any statute or federal law to seek counsel fees and costs.

VIII. EXCLUSIONS FROM AND OBJECTIONS TO SETTLEMENT 

1. The  Opt-Out Date  will be a date set by the Court and identified in the Notice
(defined below).

2. Each Settlement Class Member who wishes to be excluded from the Settlement Class
must mail or otherwise deliver to the Administrator an appropriate written request for

26

exclusion, including his or her name, address, telephone number and Social Security number,
that is personally signed by the Settlement Class Member, which request must be postmarked no later
than the Opt-Out Date and actually received by the Administrator. No Settlement Class Member, or
any person acting on behalf of or in concert or in participation with that Settlement Class Member,
may request exclusion of any other Settlement Class Member from the Settlement Class. The original
requests for exclusion shall be filed with the Court by the Administrator not later than 30 days
after the Opt-Out Date. The filing shall redact the social security number of the person requesting
exclusion, except for the last three digits. Copies of requests for exclusion will be provided by
the Administrator to Class Counsel and counsel for the Settling Defendants not later than five days
after the Opt-Out Date. If this Agreement is approved, any and all persons within the Settlement
Class who have not submitted a timely, valid and proper written request for exclusion from the
Settlement Class will be bound by the releases and other terms and conditions set forth herein and
all proceedings, orders and judgments in the Action, even if those persons have previously
initiated or subsequently initiate individual litigation or other proceedings against the Settling
Defendants (or any of them) relating to the claims released pursuant to or covered by the terms of
this Settlement.

3. Any Settlement Class Member who has not filed a timely, valid and proper written
request for exclusion and who wishes to object to the fairness, reasonableness or adequacy of this
Agreement or the settlement, or to any award of attorneys  fees and expenses, must serve upon
Coordinating Counsel and counsel for the Settling Defendants (by mail, hand or by facsimile
transmission) and must be received by the Court, no later than the Opt-Out Date or as the Court may
otherwise direct, a statement of his/her objection, as well as the specific reason(s), if any, for
each objection, including any legal support the Settlement Class Member

27

wishes to bring to the Court s attention and a description of any evidence the Settlement
Class Member wishes to introduce in support of the objection. Settlement Class Members may so
object either on their own or through an attorney hired at their own expense who files an
appearance on their behalf.

IX. THE FINAL JUDGMENT AND ORDERS OF DISMISSAL 

1. If, after the Final Approval Hearing, the proposed Settlement is approved by the
Court with respect to one or more Settlement Classes, Class Counsel shall promptly file and request
entry of a Final Order, substantially in the form of Exhibit D, by the Court:

(a) Finding that the requirements necessary for certification of the Settlement
Class for purposes of settlement, have been satisfied, approving both the final certification of
the Settlement Class and the Agreement, judging its terms to be fair, reasonable, adequate and in
the best interests of the Settlement Class, directing consummation of its terms, and reserving
continuing jurisdiction to implement, enforce, administer, effectuate, interpret and monitor
compliance with the provisions of the Agreement and the Judgment;

(b) Dismissing the Action and the Released Claims, with prejudice and without costs
(except as otherwise provided herein) against Plaintiffs and all Settlement Class Members, and
releasing both the Released Claims and all of the claims described in Section I, Paragraphs 2
through 5 against the Released Parties; and

(c) Permanently barring and enjoining Plaintiffs and Settlement Class Members from
asserting, commencing, prosecuting or continuing any of the Released Claims or any of the claims
described in Section I, Paragraphs 2 through 5 against the Released Parties, except in a manner
consistent with all terms and conditions of Section VII, Paragraph 2, to the extent applicable.

28

2. Within 14 days after the Effective Date, Plaintiffs shall, with appropriate
court approvals, dismiss their claims pending in the  Cummins  Action, the  Mitchell  Action, the  Green 
Action, and the  Becker  Action.

X. NOTICE AND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT 

1. Class Counsel will submit preliminary approval papers for the settlement,
including a Motion for Preliminary Approval and the proposed Preliminary Approval Order, together
with a proposed form or forms of Notice and a Summary Notice substantially in the form of Exhibit H
(the  Notice  and  Summary Notice ), the proposed form of the Final Order, and the executed
Agreement, within a reasonable time following of execution of this Agreement.

2. Class Counsel will submit to the Court the proposed Preliminary Approval Order
which will, among other things, certify the respective Settlement Classes  for settlement
purposes only , approve Plaintiffs as adequate representatives of the respective Settlement
Classes, and ask for a date for a  Final Approval Hearing.  The proposed Preliminary Approval Order
also will approve the form of the Notice, will find that the method of notice selected constitutes
the best notice to all persons within the definitions of the respective Settlement Classes that is
practicable under the circumstances, and will find that the form and method of notice comply fully
with all applicable law.

3. The Parties propose the following Notice regime:

(a) The appropriate form of notice, along with a claim form, will be mailed to the last
known address of all Settlement Class Members, by first class mail, and any mail returned with a
forwarding address will be promptly re-mailed to such address;

(b) The Administrator and each Class Counsel that maintains a website will provide a
link on its website to a central site maintained by the Administrator to obtain

29

downloadable and printable copies of the Settlement Agreement, the Notice and the Claim Form;

publication in Paragraph 3 above. Additional publication notice ordered by the Court, if any, shall
be at the expense of the Settlement Class receiving such additional publication notice.

5. The Settling Defendants and Coordinating Counsel shall, by agreement, designate
an Administrator. The Settling Defendants and Coordinating Counsel agree that they will cooperate
in negotiating the Notice and Administration Costs, toward the end of reducing both costs and
preventing the Administrator from incurring any significant Administration Costs before the
Effective Date.

6. The Administrator will file with the Court and serve upon Class Counsel and
Settling Defendants  counsel no later than ten (10) days prior to the Final Approval Hearing an
affidavit or declaration stating that notice has been completed in accordance with the terms of the
Preliminary Approval Order.

7. The Final Approval Hearing will be held at a date and time to be set by the
Court after mailing of the notice and the passing of the opt-out date. At the Final Approval
Hearing, the Court will consider and determine whether the provisions of this Agreement should be
approved, whether the Settlement should be finally approved as fair, reasonable and adequate,
whether any objections to the Settlement should be overruled, and whether a Final Order approving
the Settlement and dismissing any of the actions should be entered.

30

COUNSEL 

1. Plaintiffs  Coordinating Counsel will submit a fee petition for attorneys 
fees, costs and expenses, on behalf of all Class Counsel, with all such fees and costs to be paid
from the Settlement Fund. In such Petition, Coordinating Counsel will request that the Court award
such attorneys  fees, costs and expenses to Coordinating Counsel to be distributed in his
discretion thereafter between and among all Class
Counsel. The Settling Defendants agree not to oppose in Court or any other forum such petition
by Coordinating Counsel for an award of attorneys  fees and expenses to be paid from the Settlement
Fund.

2. Entry of a Final Order is not conditioned upon an award of the attorneys  fees
and costs sought by Class Counsel.

3. Coordinating Counsel will apply to the Court for an award of service fees for
representative Plaintiffs. All service fees shall be paid out of the aforesaid fees and expenses to

entitled to receive any additional payments in connection with this settlement other than their
service fee and their  pro rata  payment under the Agreement.

4. The Settling Defendants shall not be liable for any additional fees or expenses
of Plaintiffs or any other plaintiff in any of the actions settled by this Agreement or persons
within the Settlement Class, or other plaintiffs  counsel in connection with the actions settled by
this Agreement. The Settling Defendants will be entitled to oppose any such fee application.

Counsel and counsel for the Settling Defendants with a list identifying: (1) the number of claim
forms submitted; (2) the number of RALs covered; and (3) the number of claim forms that were denied
( Denied Claims ).

3. After the Effective Date, Valid Claims will be paid by the Administrator as

or remedy any deficiency in the filing. For issues that are not administrative in nature, the
Administrator may advise the Settlement Class Member to contact Class Counsel for the person with
any questions about his or her Denied Claim.

5. A Settlement Class Member or Class Counsel may submit to the Administrator a
request to reconsider the claim denial within 45 days following the date of such denial. Such

Counsel and counsel for the Settling Defendants, and Coordinating Counsel shall promptly refer such
claims to appropriate Class Counsel for the person making the claim.

6. Class Counsel for any claimant and counsel for the Settling Defendants will meet
promptly after the Effective Date to confer regarding all Denied Claims for which requests for
reconsideration have been denied by the Administrator. Class Counsel for the claimant shall have
full settlement authority to resolve such Denied Claims. If counsel for the Parties cannot then
agree as to the treatment of a submitted Claim Form, the matter will be submitted to the Discovery
Commissioner in the  Cummins  Action ( Discovery Commissioner ) for final and binding determination,
with costs of resolution to be part of Administration Cost. Claims that are to be submitted to the
Discovery Commissioner for resolution will be submitted together in bulk no later than 30 days
after attempts at informal resolution of all Denied Claims have been completed. Should in-person
hearings be required, the Discovery Commissioner shall hold such hearings in the state in which the
respective complaining claimants reside.

33

7. This Section sets forth the exclusive procedure for determining the validity
of claims, and no Settlement Class Member may challenge the denial of any such claim except through
this procedure.

XIII. TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT 

If this Settlement Agreement, as a whole, or any respective Settlement Class it contains is
not approved by the Court or does not receive final approval after review by any court of competent
jurisdiction for any reason, or is terminated in accordance with its terms for any other reason,

Agreement as if this Agreement had never been made, and (i) the affected Parties will be relieved
from any orders or stipulations made in connection with this Agreement, other than the order
related to the filing of the Consolidated and Amended Complaint and providing that it or the
affected portions related to the disapproved Settlment Class, as appropriate, shall be stricken,
(ii) if and only if the West Virginia Class is disapproved, then the  Cummins  Action will proceed
with discovery toward trial on the merits with the merits class previously certified by the Court
as of December 30, 2004, as set forth in Section I.2 above; (iii) if and only if the Mitchell/Green

Action will proceed toward trial on
the merits with the merits class previously certified by the Court as of May 19, 2000, as set
forth in Section III above; and (v) if and only if the Becker Class is disapproved, then the  Becker 
action will proceed as directed by the court in Ohio in which it is pending. Accordingly, upon any
such termination for any reason (i) the Parties will be deemed to have preserved all their
substantive or procedural rights or defenses with respect to

34

as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) the Parties shall not be deemed to have waived any
substantive or procedural rights or defenses of any kind that they may have with respect to any
persons within the Settlement Class who were not members of the merits class that was certified in
the  Cummins  Action as of December 30, 2004, in the  Mitchell  Action as of July 11, 2003, and in the
 Green  Action as of May 19, 2000, as appropriate,; provided, that the terms of this Section XIII

Released Parties of (i) the truth or relevance of any fact alleged by Plaintiffs, (ii) the
existence of any class alleged by Plaintiffs, (iii) the propriety of class certification on the
merits if the  Cummins  Action, the  Mitchell  Action, the  Green  Action, or the  Becker  Action were to

(c) Will not be offered or received as an admission or concession that the

XIV. CONTINUING JURISDICTION 

1. The Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia, will have continuing

ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS   
  MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION  

Pending before this Court is the Plaintiffs  Motion for Class Certification pursuant to
Rule 23 of the  West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure.  Based on the findings of fact and conclusions
of law that follow, the Court determines that this case permits resolution of a myriad claims in a
single, efficient class action that poses no unusual problems of manageability. If these claims are
to be resolved at all, they will likely be resolved on a class-wide basis. Further, class-wide
resolution will not require evaluation of individual factual scenarios for each class member.
Instead, because Plaintiffs  claims center on the Defendants  conduct and legal status with respect
to the putative class members generally, this case is particularly well-suited for class
certification. Accordingly, the Court  GRANTS  the motion and certifies the class as proposed and as
indicated by the following findings of fact and conclusions of law.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  

1. 
       
     The plaintiffs filed this action as a putative class action in the Circuit Court of
Kanawha County on January 23, 2003. The Defendants timely removed the action to the federal
district court for the Southern District of West Virginia. On June 6, 2003, Judge Goodwin
granted the Plaintiffs  Motion to Remand. 

2. 
       
     The defendants then moved to dismiss and to compel arbitration. Following the
hearings on December 11, 2003, and March 18, 2004, this Court denied Defendants  motion to
dismiss and compel arbitration by Order of May 13, 2004. 

3. 
       
     The Defendants then petitioned the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia for a
writ of prohibition to prevent this Court from enforcing its Order denying their motion to
dismiss and compel arbitration. The Supreme Court ordered the plaintiffs to respond to
defendants  Petition, which was then denied on September 2, 2004. 

4. 
       
     The Plaintiffs  Motion for Class Certification was
filed on October 1, 2003. The
defendants responded on May 13, 2004, and plaintiffs filed their
reply on October 18, 2004.
The Court held a hearing on the motion for class certification on
October 21, 2004. 

5. 
       
     Before taking up that motion, the Court heard argument on Plaintiffs  Motion to Amend
the Complaint to add two corporate subsidiaries of defendant H   R Block, Inc. The Court
granted plaintiffs  motion to add Block Financial Corporation and H   R Block Services,
Inc., and ordered that the evidence on Plaintiffs  Motion for Class Certification be held
open until a second hearing on this matter could be held on December 22, 2004, to provide
these two new 

2

corporate subsidiaries and defendants an opportunity to present evidence or argument in
opposition to Plaintiffs  Motion for Class Certification, should they choose to do so.
 (Transcript from Hearing Held on Oct. 21, 2004,  at p. 17). 

6. 
       
     Discovery commenced and more than thirty depositions have been taken. Several
sets of written discovery have been exchanged. 

7. 
       
     The newly added defendants, Block Financial Corporation and H   R Block Services,
Inc. appeared at the December 22, 2004 hearing on class certification through their
counsel, Ancil G. Ramey of Steptoe   Johnson. 

8. 
       
     Prior to the December 22, 2004 hearing, Mr. Ramey filed a   Motion to Compel
Arbitration Or In The Alternative, To Dismiss ,  which asked this Court to compel
arbitration or to dismiss based on three grounds: (1) lack of personal jurisdiction, (2)
failure to state a cause of action, and (3) federal preemption. This Court then denied
both the motion to compel and the motion to dismiss and ordered the new defendants to file
an answer. 

9. 
       
     At the December 22, 2004 hearing, the Court asked Mr. Ramey to present any evidence
or argument he had to offer in regard to the class certification issue. 

10. 
       
     Mr. Ramey acknowledged that he had no evidence, but he did present argument. Mr.
Ramey argued that because his clients had recently been added to this action, due process
dictates that they receive additional time to conduct
discovery as it would pertain to the class certification issue.
 (Excerpt of Hearing RE:
Class Certification,  December 22, 2004, p. 4-5). 

3

11. 
       
     Mr. Ramey admitted that he had reviewed the record and was familiar with the case
due to his prior representation of the other defendants in their removal petition. 

12. 
       
     When asked what new information the new defendants sought, Mr. Ramey
stated that he would ask if the plaintiffs knew about the participation interest and
if they did, whether or not they would have entered into the loan transactions.
 (Excerpt of Hearing RE: Class Certification, December 22, 2004,  p. 3-4). 

13. 
       
     Additionally, Mr. Ramey stated that the additional time he was seeking was to
ask whether the plaintiffs would have participated in the rapid refund RAL program if
they had known that the lending banks paid a fee in order to participate in the loan
program.  (Excerpt of Hearing RE: Class Certification,  December 22, 2004, p. 5). 

14 
       
     Mr. Ramey urged the Court to consider the recent Supreme Court of Appeals of West
Virginia opinion in  State of West Virginia ex rel. Chemtall Inc. v. Madden,  2004 WL
2750996 (W.Va.,2004). 

15 
       
     The Court has reviewed all the pleadings and evidence in support of and in
opposition to Plaintiffs  Motion for Class Certification, as well as all the other
pleadings in the case, and heard argument of counsel spread on the
record at the
hearings on class certification of October 21, 2004 and December 22, 2004. 

16 
       
     Each party submitted proposed findings of facts and conclusions of law in regard
to the motion for class certification.

FINDINGS OF FACT  

The Underlying Claims 

1. 
       
     This action is against Defendant H   R Block, Inc., its named corporate
subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as  Block ) and the individual tax
preparers. 

2. 
       
     The plaintiffs  claims against the defendants all relate to the Rapid Refund
Program that Block offers to its clients. The Rapid Refund Program utilizes refund
anticipation loans (hereinafter  RAL  or  RALs ). 

3. 
       
     A RAL is a loan against a taxpayer s expected federal income tax refund. 

4. 
       
     H R Block offers RALs in West Virginia and throughout the United States. 

5. 
       
     Block negotiated contracts with certain lending banks that finance the RALs.
The contracts set forth the RAL application procedure, the RAL terms, the RAL
credit criteria, and the RAL prices and other matters. 

6. 
       
     Block then marketed the RAL to a target demographic. Block
defines its  RAL client
profile  as  decent, hardworking people,  who are  unsophisticated  financially, and  live pay
check to pay check.  Such clients were  very satisfied with the H R Block experience,  but
 have little understanding of what they were paying for their RAL.  Clients take RALs
because they want  to get their money quickly,  they  do not have regular bank accounts, 
can have tax preparation fees withheld, and  have no other choice to get money quickly. 
Over one-half get the earned income tax credit. Most  do not have credit cards or other
credit options.  

7. 
       
     Block tax preparers who presented these documents to the
clients were trained by Block
to present the RAL product using a formulaic sales script, in which the 

5

loan products were presented in the same order and described using the same terms to
every client. Block also provided the tax preparers with computer hardware and software for use
with its RAL customers. 

8. 
       
     Block filled out and completed the RAL applications for the clients and
directed the clients to the several places where they were to sign the documents.
Block then assembled the actual RAL application and presented it to the bank. 

9. 
       
     At the class certification hearing on October 21, 2004, the Court heard
testimony from Deborah Mounts, Block s franchise district manager for its franchise
offices in West Virginia, Ms. Mounts testified that Block provides national
advertising, merchandise, signs, copiers, toner for the copiers, pamphlets, light
boxes, furniture, and yellow page ads to its franchises. (Trans. from October 21,
2004 Hearing, p. 31-34.) Block provides capital to its franchisees in the form of a
loan secured by the franchise.  (Id.  at 35-36.) Block provides training material
and consulting services to its franchises.  (Id.  at 37-38.) In return, Block
collects royalties and receives the participation fee from the RALs sold by the
franchises. ( ld . at 43.) 

10. 
       
     Block does not believe it should tell its clients about its participation fee and
does not tell its tax-preparers about this fee.  (Id.  at 45.) Thus, any disclosure of
that fee came, if at all, from written material distributed to clients which was the
same on a year by year basis in all Block s offices in West Virginia. Block believes
that the clients who go to its franchises belong to Block, not to the franchise.  (Id.)  

11. 
       
     The plaintiffs aver that the defendants  actions, in regard to the RAL
process, amounts to a breach of a fiduciary duty owed to the plaintiffs. The
plaintiffs also 

6

aver that the royalties and participation fees are  kickbacks  which violate West
Virginia law governing credit services organizations and deceptive
practices. 

12. 
       
     The Second Amended Complaint contains seven counts, which include the following: 

(1) 
       
     Breach of Fiduciary Duty Arising Out of an Agency Relationship; 

(2) 
       
     Breach of Fiduciary
Duty Arising Out of a Confidential Relationship; 

(3) 
       
     Breach of Fiduciary Duty Arising out of H R Block s Status as a Loan Broker; 

(4) 
       
     Breach of West Virginia s Statute Governing Credit
Services Organizations; 

(5) 
       
     Breach of Contract based on implied duty of good
faith and fair dealing; 

(6) 
       
     Unjust Enrichment; and 

(7) 
       
     Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices. 

13. 
       
     The claim for unjust enrichment seeks recovery of the plaintiffs  money that the
defendants received in connection with the RALs, plus reasonable interest. 

14. 
       
     The Plaintiffs
propose a class consisting of all West Virginia residents who obtained Refund
Anticipation Loans ( RALs ) from January 1, 1994 through the present. 1  At
the October 21 hearing, plaintiffs  counsel proposed the class should be cut off on
December 31, 2003 to provide a date certain for class
determination.  (Id.  at p. 15), 

7

15. 
       
     As is evident from the definition, whether an individual is a member of the class is
based on the objective facts of whether a West Virginia resident obtained a RAL and when
he or she obtained the RAL. 

16. 
       
     The parties have also submitted uncontradicted evidence that the proposed class
contains more than 438,500 transactions. 

17. 
       
     Block either prepared tax returns for all class members or checked their returns
before filing. 

18. 
       
     The process was basically the same for every RAL client. 

19. 
       
     Block presented the same or substantially the same RAL applications, and documents
to every RAL client, at least on a year-to-year basis.  (Id.  at 57-58.) 

20 
       
     The contracts between H R Block and the lending banks created the common framework
against which all the RAL applications were considered and all the RALs were processed.
Additionally, these contracts apply to all RALs the defendants offered in West Virginia. 

21 
       
     Each of the named plaintiffs understands that he or she is representing a number of
unnamed class members in this case, and understands that he or she owes a duty to treat
those absent class members fairly. 

22. 
       
     The named plaintiffs are represented by the law firm of Bailey   Glasser, LLP, whom
they move to appoint as lead class counsel. John Barrett of the Barrett
Law Firm is proposed as co-counsel. 

23. 
       
     Plaintiffs have moved for certification under Rule 23(b)(3).

STATEMENT OF THE LAW  

1. 
       
     The claims based on the West Virginia Consumer Credit and
Protection Act and the
prohibitions against unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive
acts or practices is based on the definitions of such actions, as they are
defined in  West Virginia Code,  section 46A-6-102(f). 

2. 
       
     The prohibited acts include   t he act use or employment by any person of any
deception, fraud, false pretense, false promise or misrepresentation, or the
concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact with intent that others rely
upon such concealment, suppression or omission, in connection with the sale or
advertisement of any goods or services,  whether or not any person has in fact been
misled, deceived or damaged thereby.    W.Va. Code,
  46A-6-102(f)(13)  (emphasis added).  

3. 
       
     The Court recognizes that a determination of class status should occur as soon as
practicable after the filing of the action, and believes that this issue is now ripe for
determination. 

4. 
       
      In general, class actions are a flexible vehicle for correcting wrongs committed
by a large-scale enterprise upon individual consumers.   In re West Virginia Rezulin
Litigation,  214 W. Va. 52, 62, 585 S.E.2d 52, 62 (2003). 

5. 
       
     On a motion for class certification, a court should not inquire into the merits
of the parties  contentions.  See  Syl. Pts, 6   7, Rezulin, 214 W.Va. 52.
 The dispositive question is not whether the plaintiff has stated a cause of action or
will prevail on the merits, but rather whether the requirements of Rule 23 have been
met.   Rezulin,  Syl. Pt. 7. 

9

6. 
       
     Under Rule 23(a) of the  West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure,  a class
action is appropriate when the party seeking to certify a class has proved that: 

(a) 
       
     the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;  

(b) 
       
     there are questions of law or fact common to the class; 

(c) 
       
     the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of
the
claims or defenses of the class; and 

(d) 
       
     the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the
interests of
the class. 

W.  Va. Rules of Civil Procedure,  Rule 23(a)

Numerosity 

7. 
       
     Rule 23(a)(1) requires that a class be so numerous that joinder of all members is
impracticable.  Rezulin,  Syl. pt. 9. 

Commonality 

8. 
       
     Rule 23(a)(2) requires that there be questions of law or fact common to the
members of the proposed class.   A  common nucleus of operative fact or law is
usually enough to satisfy the commonality requirement.   Rezulin,  Syl. Pt. 11. 

9. 
       
     The threshold of  commonality  is not high, and requires only that the resolution of
common questions that affect all or a substantial number of class members.  Rezulin,  Syl.
pt. 11. 

10. 
       
     The Court in Rezulin quoted from  Newburg on Class Actions, 4   th    Ed.,    3:12
at 314-315 (2002), when it stated the following: 

Individual issues will often be present in a class action, especially in
connection with individual defenses against class plaintiffs, rights of
individual class members to recover in the event a violation is established, and
the type or amount of relief individual class members may be entitled to
receive. Nevertheless, it is settled that the common issues need not be
dispositive of the litigation. The fact that class members must individually
demonstrate their right to recover, or that they may suffer varying
degrees of
injury, will not bar a class action; nor is a class action precluded by the
presence of individual defenses against class plaintiffs.  

Rezulin,
214 W. Va. at 68. 

10

Typicality 

11. 
       
     Rule 23(a)(3) requires that the claims of the representative party be  typical  of
those of the class. Typicality focuses on the desired characteristics of the class
representative. 

12. 
       
      The Rezulin  Court held that  a representative party s claim or defense Is typical if it
arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims
of the other class members, and if his or her claims are based on the
same legal theory.   Rezulin,  Syl. Pt. 12. 

13. 
       
     The Court further explained that typicality: 

only requires that the class representative s claims be typical of the other
class members  claims not that the claims be identical,... When the claim arises
out of the same legal or remedial theory, the presence of factual variations is
normally not sufficient to preclude class action treatment.... D ifferences in the
situation of each plaintiff or each class member do not necessarily defeat
typicality; the harm suffered by the named plaintiffs may differ in
degree from that suffered by other members of the class so long as the harm suffered
is of the same type. Furthermore, the fact that a defense may be asserted against
the named representative, as well as some other class members, but not the class
as a whole, does not destroy the representative s status.

Rezulin, 214 W.Va. at 67-68. 

Adequacy of Representation 

14. 
       
     Rule 23(a)(4) requires that the representative parties must fairly and adequately
protect the interests of the class. 

15. 
       
     The first part of Rule 23(a)(4) tests the representative party s attorneys  ability
to vigorously represent the entire class based on available resources to investigate
claims and contact class members, and the attorneys  overall competence and experience.
 Id.  at Syl. Pt. 13. 

11

16. 
       
     The class representatives must  share a strong interest in establishing the
liability of the defendants and seek the same types of relief and damages requested for
other class members.   Rezulin,  214 W. Va. at 69. 

17. 
       
     The second part of Rule 23(a)(4) inquires whether there are  conflicts of interest
between named parties and the class they seek to represent.   W. Va. R, Civ. P.  23(a)(4). 

Rule 23(b) Requirements 

18. 
       
     An action that satisfies all of the Rule 23(a) requirements may be maintained as a
class action if the court finds that it also meets one of the three prerequisites of Rule
23(b).  Rezulin,  Syl. Pt. 8. 

19. 
       
     Under Rule 23(b)(3), a class action may be certified to proceed on behalf of a
class if the trial court finds  that the questions of law or fact common to the members
of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members  and finds
that a class action  is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient
adjudication of the controversy.   W. Va. R. Civ. P.  23(b)(3). 

20. 
       
      The predominance criterion in Rule 23(b)(3) is a
corollary to the  commonality 
requirement found in Rule 23(a)(2). While the commonality requirement simply requires a
showing of common questions, the  predominance  requirement requires a showing
that the common questions of law or fact outweigh individual questions. 
 Rezulin,  214 W. Va. at 71. 

21. 
       
      A conclusion on the issue of predominance requires an evaluation of the legal
issues and the proof needed to establish them.   Id.  at 72. The predominance
requirement is not a rigid test, but rather contemplates a review of many
factors, 

12

the central question being whether  adjudication of the common issues in the
particular suit has important and desirable advantages of judicial economy compared to
all other issues, or when viewed by themselves.   Id.  (citations omitted).

22. 
       
     The  Chemtall  case cited by Mr. Ramey in his argument for additional time to
conduct discovery held that West Virginia courts should conduct a thorough analysis
of motions to certify, and if a court grants the motion, it should enter a specific,
detailed order, with relevant findings of fact and conclusions of law, that
indicates the basis for certification and the satisfaction of Rule 23 prerequisites.
 State of West Virginia ex rel. Chemtall Inc. v. Madden,  2004 WL 2750996 (W.Va.,2004). 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  

Due Process Argument 

1. 
       
     The Court finds that Mr. Ramey did not offer any convincing reason for this Court to
grant the new defendants additional time for discovery relating to class certification
issues. 

2. 
       
     The Court has reviewed the  Chemtall  opinion and believes that it has conducted a
thorough analysis of the issues presented and believes that such an analysis is evident
from this detailed Order. 

3. 
       
     Mr. Ramey s reasons for asking for additional discovery time did not relate to class
certification issues, rather they went to the merits of the claims. 

4. 
       
     Supreme Court case law dictates that this Court should not inquire into the merits of
the claims when reviewing a motion for class certification. 

13

5. 
       
     Whether or not the plaintiffs would have engaged in the RAL program if they knew
of the alleged kickbacks and hidden fees does not affect the maintainability of this
action as a class action. The new defendants have failed to show to this Court how such
information relates to any of the Rule 23 factors. 

6. 
       
     The fact that certain class members would have signed the RAL had they known of the
fees, and the fact that others would not have signed the RAL with this information does
not affect the class certification issue at hand. Although one might question whether this
affects typicality, it does not in this instance because it is not pertinent to the
underlying claim. The plaintiffs need not aver or prove that they were in fact misled,
deceived, or even damaged to prove a prima facie case of unfair and deceptive practices. 

7. 
       
     Therefore, the Court does hereby find that the new defendants, represented by Mr.
Ramey, were given sufficient notice and opportunity to be heard on class certification and
presented no reasons, related to the certification issue, for which this Court is willing
to grant additional time for discovery. 

Class Definition 

8. 
       
     The Court finds the proposed class is objectively defined as it is easily
determined whether a particular individual is a member of the class. 

Numerosity 

9. 
       
     Given that there are more than 438,500 transactions, although some of these
transactions may represent repeat customers, the Court finds and concludes that he
proposed class is so numerous that joinder of all of its members would be impracticable
and numerosity is satisfied. 

14

Commonality 

10. 
       
     The Court finds that there is no factual basis to distinguish the claims of proposed
class members at Block-owned offices from those at franchise offices. 2  

11. 
       
     In fact, there are numerous questions of law and fact common to class members.
Some of those common issues of law and fact include the following: 

a. 
       
     Whether Block was required to comply with West
Virginia s law governing credit services organizations when it arranges
refund anticipation loans; 

b. 
       
     Whether the class members are buyers within the meaning
of the credit services organizations statute; 

c. 
       
     Whether Block negotiates contracts with lenders,
funnels its RAL customers to the lenders, and then receives payment for
that referral; 

d. 
       
     Whether Block secretly concealed profits made on
brokering RAL  

e. 
       
     Whether Block was the taxpayers  agent or broker; 

f. 
       
     Whether Block had a confidential relationship with the
taxpayer that would create a fiduciary duty; and if so, did Block breach
that duty; and 

g. 
       
     Whether Block breached the contract to obtain
RAL s or was
unjustly enriched at the expense of class members. 

12. 
       
     Because the class members  claims directly relate to the RAL that was offered each
year, and based on the questions of law and fact for each of those years,
this Court finds that resolution of common questions that affect all or a 

2  
       
     Ms. Mounts also testified at the October 21,2004 hearing that Block s Williamson, West
Virginia franchise uses a different computer software platform for
obtaining RALs. (Hearing Trans. at 67-68.) This testimony contradicts that given by Block s corporate representative
on franchises. (Ex. C, Pis.  Reply to Defs.  Mem, of Law in Supp. of Mot. for Part l Summ.
J.) Nevertheless, should the evidence ultimately show that the Williamson Block franchise
RALS are materially different from those in the rest of Block s West Virginia offices, those
RALs can be excluded from the class. 

15

substantial number of class members can be achieved through the maintenance of a class
action. 

13. 
       
     For these reasons, the Court finds and concludes that commonality is satisfied. 

Typicality 

14. 
       
     As described above, the offer and application process for the RAL constitute a common
practice and course of conduct that establish typicality. Those events did not differ for the
representative plaintiffs in any respect relevant to typicality. Plaintiffs  claims focus
squarely on Block s conduct and do not depend on customer-specific representations. 

15. 
       
     Additionally, the representative plaintiffs  claims are based on the same legal theory as
those of the class generally. Plaintiffs claim that as a tax prepare, loan broker, and agent,
Block had a duty to its clients. They further claim that Block breached that duty by failing
to disclose its self-dealing according to plaintiffs and brokering a loan while hiding the
participating fee. 

16. 
       
     Block complains that Deadra Cummins and Ivan and LaDonna Bell are not
typical of the class because each had individual reasons to get a RAL and
individual reactions and experiences when they got the RAL. Contrary to Block s
contention, however, Cummins and the Bells are  typical  of RAL borrowers in
the ordinary, everyday sense of the word  typical.  These representative
plaintiffs are just the type of people Block targets for its RAL-product. 

17. 
       
     Ordinary typicality, however, is not tested under  Rezulin.  The test is legal
typicality, whether Cummins  and the Bells  claims are  typical  of the class
claims, in fact and law. This Court finds that the claims of the proposed class 

16

representatives are typical of those claims of the several class members as they
share essentially the same facts and require the same legal analysis as it relates to
the individual counts included in the Second Amended Complaint. 

18. 
       
     The claim for unjust enrichment seeks recovery of monies paid by each plaintiff.
The facts relevant to recovery for each member of the class are
virtually identical. 

19. 
       
     Because unjust enrichment is predicated in equity, the Court finds that all members of
the class can be adequately protected through the maintenance of a class action. 

20. 
       
     The defendants claim that individual issues of trust and reliance abound in regard
to the plaintiffs  claims based on an alleged fiduciary duty. However, whether or not the
defendants were agents, loan brokers, or credit services organizations does not vary from
client to client. The relationship, if any, was formed from the RAL application process. 

21. 
       
     Additionally, if the defendants were agents, loan brokers, or credit services
organizations, the duty each defendant owed to each class member does not vary or depend
on the class member; it can be determined from the RAL documents and the alleged
systematic actions of the defendants when offering and providing RALs through their Rapid
Refund Program. 

22. 
       
     The unfair and deceptive practices claim will depend on a determination as to whether
the services offered by Block were  goods  and whether Block s conduct constitutes a
consumer transaction that occurred in the course of trade or commerce. Whether or not the
plaintiffs can recover will depend on whether the 

17

defendants  actions amount to  methods of  competition and unfair or deceptive
acts or practices  as defined by  West Virginia Code,  section   46A-6-102.

23. 
       
     The acts and practices that will be pertinent to this determination are based on the
defendants  actions in offering and providing RALs. To the extent that the defendants used
the same techniques, procedures, and RAL applications, there is no variance between class
members and no individual issues that would defeat commonality. 

24. 
       
     The breach of contract claim, based on an implied duty of good faith, will be
reviewed according to the contract, if one is found, and whether or not the defendants
acted in good faith and fair dealing in its disclosures and actions. The plaintiffs 
averments were sufficient to avoid a dismissal for failure to state a claim, but
this claim, and all others, may be removed from class certification or otherwise dismissed
if further evidence dictates such a decision. 

25. 
       
     The Court has considered and rejected Block s claim that Ms. Cummins cannot maintain
her claims because in February 2003 she obtained another RAL from Jackson Hewitt. As
Plaintiffs  counsel pointed out at argument, Ms. Cummins obtained this RAL from a Block
competitor, and not from Block. This case pertains to Block s conduct and Block s
disclosures. It has nothing to do with some other company s conduct and disclosures. 

26. 
       
     Block also has argued that the named plaintiffs  lack standing  to challenge the RAL
process in 1994 and 2003 when none of them actually obtained RALS through Block in those
years. This is not a standing question. Plaintiffs have standing because they suffered
injury in fact, fairly traceable to the defendants, 

18

and for which the Court can provide a remedy. See  Lujan v. Defenders of
Wildlife,  504 U.S. 555 (1992). Instead, this argument attempts to attack typicality. As
noted above, however, the named plaintiffs  claims need only be typical, but not
identical, to those of the class. See  Rezulin  at 67-68.

27. 
       
     Based on the foregoing, the claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims
of the proposed class and, accordingly, the Court finds and concludes
Plaintiffs satisfy the typicality requirement. 

Adequacy of Representation 

Class Representatives 

28. 
       
     No party has demonstrated any conflicts of interest between the named plaintiffs
or proposed class counsel and the proposed class. 

29. 
       
     The Court finds each named plaintiff has a common sense and sufficient understanding
of his or her duties as a class representative and the legal and factual basis for his or
her claim. 

30. 
       
     The class representatives  share a strong interest in establishing the liability of
the defendants and seek the same types of relief and damages requested for other class
members.   Rezulin,  214 W. Va. at 68. All plaintiffs seek disgorgement of funds wrongfully
withheld, as well as statutory penalties. While amounts of individual damages may vary,
the formulas and methodology for
recovery are the same. 

Class Counsel 

31. 
       
     Several individual attorneys making appearances on behalf of the plaintiffs have
been counsel to certified classes in the past. The pleadings and argument on 

19

behalf of the plaintiffs have been thoughtful, competent and professional. From
their performance thus far in this case, the Court finds that Plaintiffs attorneys are
competent and experienced not only in general matters of civil litigation, but also
specifically in the area of class action and multi-plaintiff litigation.

32. 
       
     While the defendants made allegations of unethical conduct against proposed class
counsel, such conduct, even if committed, does not provide reason for this Court to find
that a conflict exists between the class and the class representatives or between the
class and proposed counsel for the class. 

33. 
       
     The Court further finds that Plaintiffs  attorneys possess the available resources
to investigate the claims and prosecute this litigation. 

34. 
       
     The Court finds and concludes that the named plaintiffs and proposed class counsel
together and individually will fairly and adequately protect the interests
of the class. 

35. 
       
     Based on the  Rezulin  decision, the Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied all the
Rule 23(a) requirements of numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy. 

Rule 23(b)(3) Requirements 

36. 
       
     Defendants have not identified any individual issues that would negate a finding
that the common issues predominate. 

37. 
       
     Both parties claim that common issues, fundamental to plaintiffs  theories of the
case, can be adjudicated on cross-motions for summary judgment. Both parties have, in
fact, already moved for summary judgment and briefed the issues whether Block is a loan
broker, a credit services organization, or acts as the agent of its RAL clients. Both
parties have also moved for summary judgment on 

20

and
briefed the issues of whether Block has a fiduciary duty to its  RAL
clients;  and whether Block s acts were unfair or deceptive.

38. 
       
     On both parties  own account, therefore, the fundamental legal issues of this action
predominate in the Rule 23 sense that they may be determined by the
Court for all class members because both parties agree, there are no questions of
material fact and they may be decided as a matter of law. 

39. 
       
     The Court finds and concludes that because common issues
predominate, certifying this
case as a class action would provide desirable advantages of judicial economy, when
compared with any court s individual determination of
these fundamental questions for even a small number of the plaintiffs
represented here. 

40. 
       
     Finally, and for some of the same reasons set forth above, the plaintiffs have
satisfied the Rule 23(b)(3) requirement  that a class action is superior to other
available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.  This
requirement focuses upon a comparison of available alternatives.   Rezulin,  214 W. Va.
at 75. 

41. 
       
       F orcing numerous plaintiffs to litigate the alleged misconduct of the defendants in
hundreds or thousands of repeated individual trials, especially where
a plaintiff s
individual damages may be relatively small, runs counter to the very purpose of a class
action....  T o determine the superiority of a class action in a particular case ,  other
factors must also be considered, as must the purposes of Rule 23, including: conserving
time, effort and expense; providing a forum for small claimants; and deterring illegal
activities.   Id.,  at 75-76. 

21

42. 
       
     Plaintiffs have pursued and Block has defended this case vigorously. Both sides have done
substantial discovery and depositions have occurred in no less than four states. Plaintiffs
aver that they have spent more than $535,000 in time and expense so far. By contrast, the most
any individual class member could recover, even assuming all of West Virginia s statutory
penalties apply, would be about $3,700 per transaction. 

43. 
       
     As Judge Posner recently observed,   A  class action has to be unwieldy indeed before it can
be pronounced an inferior alternative   no matter how massive the fraud or other wrongdoing
that will go unpunished if class treatment is denied  to to no litigation at all.   Carnegie
v. Household Int I, Inc.,  376 F.3d 656, 661 (7 th  Cir. 2004). 

44. 
       
     The Court finds and concludes that a class action is the superior, if not the only realistic
way to resolve this dispute. The cost of pursuing an individual claim such as this would be so
far outweighed by the cost that the only real alternative to a class action would be no action
at all. 

45. 
       
     For the reasons set forth above and the record herein, the
Court  GRANTS  Plaintiff s
motion for class certification as follows: 

(a) 
       
     The class proposed by plaintiffs is  CERTIFIED,  consisting of all West Virginia
residents who obtained Refund Anticipation Loans ( RALs ) from January 1,1994 through
the present, as to all claims contained in the plaintiff s Second Amended Complaint. 

(b) 
       
     Deadra D. Cummins and Ivan and Ladonna Bell will be class
representatives; and 

22

(c) 
       
     Bailey   Glasser, LLP, will be lead counsel. 

(d) 
       
     This class certification is conditional. If further discovery
 uncovers  evidence
that negates the maintainability of this class action,  the
Court  may decertify, alter,
or amend this order. 

Accordingly, the case may proceed as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(a) and
Rule 23(b)(3).

Within ten days of the date of entry of this Order, plaintiffs shall provide the
Court and all counsel a proposed notice and opt-out form for approval.

Within ten days from the date that plaintiffs provide counsel with the proposed notice,
defense counsel shall submit to the Court and plaintiffs  counsel a written response to the
proposed notice and opt-out form.

The Court notes and preserves the objections of all parties.

The
Clerk is  DIRECTED  to send a certified copy of this Order to all counsel of record.

ENTERED

Defendants

BEFORE: Hon. Louis H. Bloom

Excerpt of Hearing

RE: Class Certification

December 22, 2004

Connie L. Cooke

Official Reporter

BE IT REMEMBERED, that the following is an excerpt from a hearing in the matter of
DEADRA D. CUMMINS, et als, Plaintiffs versus H   R BLOCK, INC., et als, Defendants, upon Civil
Action No. 03-C-134, as stated in the caption hereto, the following transpired:

THE COURT: What further would you inquire? Specifically, what questions would you like to
ask? What discovery that you already have   I m not going to allow you to duplicate anything that
is in the record  

MR. RAMEY: Absolutely, and I don t want to do that, your Honor.

First of all, one of the problems
with the Complaint is it only mentions my clients, and it refers collectively to  

THE COURT: My question to you, sir, was what specific discovery would you want to
undertake?

MR. RAMEY: I would want to undertake   I would want an explanation of the specific causes
of action they are alleging against my clients, the specific facts upon which those  

THE COURT: This is a notice of pleading in West Virginia. I would like to know
specifically

3

what questions you would ask, and who would you ask them?

MR. RAMEY: I would ask what acts or omissions were committed by my clients
specifically upon which, for example, in class certification, class certification is based.

I would ask for the production of
any documents in the possession of the plaintiffs that were in furtherance of these issues of class
certification.

One of my clients is Block Financial Corporation  

THE COURT: Then I would hear your arguments based on the record as developed by the
plaintiff at this point. If you have arguments that your folks aren t involved in this, now is the
time to do it.

MR. RAMEY: Okay. The other questions I would ask is apparently the plaintiffs  claim
against Block Financial Corporation is that Block Financial Corporation had a participation
interest in some of the loans that were made. I have not been given an opportunity, nor have the
plaintiffs been asked, for example, Did you know about a participation interest?

4

Had you known of a participation interest, would it have caused you not to enter into these
loan transactions?

No one has asked those questions
because may clients weren t in the case, and I believe that I deserve, as a matter of due process
and the Rules of Civil Procedure, to ask these plaintiffs specific questions regarding that
particular claim.

For example, your Honor,
McDonald s, you go to McDonald s, they pay franchise fees. I would ask these plaintiffs, Well, you
claim that you would not have entered into these transactions if you knew that Block Financial
Corporation had a participation interest in these loan transactions, but when you go to McDonald s,
were you aware that the local McDonald s pays a franchise fee? Are you telling me that you would
not buy a Big Mac because you now know, or you wouldn t have bought a Big Mac back then had you
known that the local franchise pays franchise fees?

No one asked these plaintiffs any
of these questions, because my clients were involved in the case.

My other client is Block Services.

5

And apparently all they ve done is, banks that want to participate in the loan program pay a
licensing fee. This has nothing to do with the plaintiffs in this case.

I would ask the plaintiffs the same question: If you were aware that the banks   that you
thought, if that s what your testimony is, were extending you the loan paid a fee in order to
participate in that loan program, would it have made any difference to you? Do you feel you were
damaged by that?

No one asked those questions. And
before a class is certified against my clients, all I m asking for is an opportunity to ask those
questions, seek that information, develop the record so that I can come into this Court and in a
meaningful manner argue to the Court based upon the evidence why you should not certify questions
as to my two clients, who have only recently been brought into the case. And essentially,
your Honor, my argument is no more than that.

STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA,

COUNTY OF

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF MOBILE COUNTY, ALABAMA 

LEVON MITCHELL and GERAL MITCHELL, 
on behalf of themselves and all others 
similarly situated, 

Plaintiffs, 

H R BLOCK, INC., RUTH R. WREN, jointly 
and individually, 

Defendants. 

ORDER GRANTING CLASS CERTIFICATION  

This matter is before the Court on the Plaintiffs  Motion for Class Certification.
Plaintiffs seek certification of claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment,
and
breach of contract. All of these claims arise out of Defendant H R Block, Inc. s ( Block )
Refund Anticipation Loan program. The Court finds, after a probing, rigorous analysis
and examination of the pleadings, Plaintiffs  Motion for Class Certification, the
evidence submitted by Plaintiffs, all other evidence of record, the briefs of the
parties, the oral argument of counsel, and the applicable law, that Plaintiffs have
established their entitlement to class certification under Ala.R.Civ.P. 23 and  Ala.
Code  1975   6-5-641(e). Specifically, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs, as the
parties with the burden of proof on class certification, have satisfied the requisites
of Ala.R.Civ.P. 23(a) and 23(b)(3) for certification of a class. The Court understands
that a class action is not maintainable by virtue of its designation as such in the
pleadings. Therefore, the Court has probed extensively beyond the pleadings and has
devoted much consideration to the evidence

adduced in determining that each requirement of Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b)(3) has been
satisfied.

The Class shall consist of the following:

BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY/UNJUST ENRICHMENT SUBCLASS  

All natural persons who (1) engaged H R Block, Inc., or its franchisees, to obtain a Refund
Anticipation Loan ( RAL ) In the State of Alabama, (2) who obtained a RAL for which H R Block,
Inc., received directly or indirectly from a third-party lender either a  licensing fee  payment
and/or a portion of the finance charges paid by the customer pursuant to the loan, (3) at any time
during the period from June 13, 1993, through December 31,1996, and (4) whose RAL application
contained the following or substantially similar provisions: (a) the person authorizes H R Block,
or H R Block and Its affiliates, to disclose to a lending Institution the person s income tax
returns, all information contained in such returns, and all information supplied to H R Block, for
the purpose of enabling the lending institution to determine whether or not to make an RAL; and (b)
provides that H R Block may not use or disclose such information for any purpose other than as
stated in the RAL application.

Excluded from the Class are H R Block, Inc., any parent, subsidiary, or affiliate of H R Block,
Inc.; the officers, directors, agents, servants, or employees of any of the same; and the members
of the immediate families of any such person. Likewise excluded from the Class are any members of
the Judicial Branch of the State of Alabama, and the members of the Immediate families of any such
person.

BREACH OF CONTRACT SUBCLASS  

All natural persons who (1) engaged H R Block, Inc., or Its franchisees, to obtain a Refund
Anticipation Loan ( RAL ) In the State of Alabama, (2) who obtained a RAL for which H R Block,
Inc., received directly or indirectly from a third-party lender either a  licensing fee  payment
and/or a portion of the finance charges paid by the customer pursuant to the loan, (3) at any time
during the period from June 13, 1989, through December 31,1996, and (4) whose RAL application
contained the following or substantially similar provisions: (a) the person

2

authorizes H R Block, or H R Block and its affiliates, to
disclose to a lending institution the person s income tax
returns, all information contained in such returns, and all
information supplied to H R Block, for the purpose of enabling
the lending institution to determine whether or not to make an
RAL; and (b) provides that H R Block may not use or disclose
such information for any purpose other than as stated In the
RAL application.

Excluded from the Class are H R Block, Inc., any
parent, subsidiary, or affiliate of H R Block, Inc.;
the officers, directors, agents, servants, or employees of any of the same; and the
members of the Immediate families of any such person.
Likewise excluded from the Class are any members of the
Judicial Branch of the State of Alabama, and the
members of the immediate families of any such person.

This certification is based upon the following factual and legal
findings:

I .   FACTUAL BACKGROUND  

Block offers tax preparation services to the general public. In addition
to its tax preparation services, Block offers its customers a service called
 Rapid Refund,  The Rapid Refund program functions in the following manner: for
a fee, Block will electronically file a customer s tax return with the Internal
Revenue Service ( IRS ), Electronic filing enables the taxpayer to obtain a
refund, if one is owed, in an expedited manner.

Block also offers a service known as  Refund Anticipation Loans  ( RALs ).
Block s customers must participate in the Rapid Refund program to be eligible
for a RAL. RALs are obtained in the following manner: Block enters into
arrangements with banking institutions (the  lender banks ), whereby they will
extend loans to Block customers. The loans are secured by the customers 
anticipated tax refunds. With a RAL, Block s customers can receive the loan
proceeds within a few days, faster than a refund obtained through electronic
filing can be received. The RALs are paid off later by the actual refund

3

from the IRS. The lender banks charge a fee for the RAL, which is disclosed to the customer. This
fee is deducted from the amount of the RAL.

Block prepares its customers  RAL applications and transmits them, the information contained
in its customers  tax returns, and other information furnished by its customers, to the lender
banks. Block solicits the lender banks  acceptance of the RAL applications, receives the proceeds
of the RALs, and delivers the proceeds to its customers. The RAL applications give Block authority
to disclose its customers  tax returns, and all information supplied to Block by its customers, to
the lender banks. The RAL applications also expressly restrict Block from using this information
for any purpose other than enabling the lender banks to determine whether or not to make a RAL, or
as permitted by Treasury Regulation   301.7216. The RAL applications do not permit Block to use
this information for its own financial gain. Neither does Treasury Regulation
301.7216. 1 

Plaintiffs allege that under Block s arrangement with the lender banks, Block received a
 license fee,  characterized as a  kickback  by Plaintiffs, from the lender banks for each
RAL. 2  Plaintiffs further contend that although the RAL fee charged by the lender banks
was disclosed to Block s customers, the license fee paid to Block was not disclosed. 3 

1  
       
     This Treasury Regulation is presently codified at 26 C.F.R.   301.7216-1, -2 and
- -3. It was in effect during the Class Periods in a materially identical form. 

2  
       
     It is undisputed that Block received a license fee from RALs made through its
company-owned offices for at least a portion of the Class Periods. Block contends that it did not
receive license fees from RALs made to customers of its franchised offices, and that it did not
receive license fees before 1992. The Court will address these contentions under its discussion of
typicality,  infra.  

3  
       
     Block contends that the license fee was disclosed to the named Plaintiffs, and to
everyone else who received a RAL through Mellon Bank in 1994. The Court will address this
contention in its discussion of typicality,  infra.  It is established that the license fee was 

4

The license fee payment to Block constitutes a portion of the RAL fee charged by the lender banks.
The amount of the license fee charged by the lender banks varied from year to year during the Class
Periods, but was uniform for any given year.

Block also entered into  pooling agreements  or  participation agreements  with the lender
banks. By the terms of these agreements, Block would buy 49.999999% of the RALs issued by the
lender banks at a discount and realize a profit when the taxpayer s tax refund paid off the
loan. 4  It is undisputed between the parties that, if Block received any money from the
RALs during the class periods because of the pooling agreements, it did not disclose this fact to
its customers. 5 

Named Plaintiffs Levon Mitchell and Geral Mitchell participated in Block s Rapid Refund
program and obtained RALs. Levon Mitchell and Geral Mitchell obtained the RAL upon which their
class claims are based in 1995 (for tax year 1994). Their RAL was obtained through Armstrong
Business Services, Inc., a Block-franchised office.

II .   LEGAL ANALYSIS  

not disclosed to Block s customers during the remainder of the Class Periods. Block acknowledges
that there were no written disclosures In the RAL transactions other than, Block contends, in
1994. Block makes the purely speculative assertion that class members may have learned about the
license fee  from their tax preparer or from press releases or other publicly disseminated
documents.  (Block s Post-Hearing Brief, p. 11). This is based upon  one  affidavit of a Block
customer, which is vague and ambiguous. (Def. Exh. 56, 5). The Court will not credit such
guesswork and conjecture. 

4  
       
     Block contends that It received no income from pooling agreements attributable to
RALs made in Alabama during the Class Periods. The Court will address this contention under its
discussion of typicality,  Infra.  

5  
       
     Although not argued by Block, the Court notes that the alleged disclosure in
1994, discussed subsequently, could encompass the pooling agreements. 

5

Plaintiffs
seek class certification pursuant to Ala. R. Civ. Proc. 23(b){3). As such,
Plaintiffs must meet the criteria for Rule 23(a), as well as the elements set forth in Rule
23(b)(3). Rule 23(a) permits certification where:

(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is
impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the
class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are
typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the
representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the
interests of the class.

If the criteria of Rule 23(a) are satisfied, an action is maintainable as a Rule 23(b)(3)
class action if:

the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the
members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only
individual members, and that a class action Is superior to other
available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the
controversy.

The question of class certification is a procedural one distinct from the merits of the
action.   Mitchell v. H R Block, Inc. ,783 So. 2d 812, 816 (Ala. 2000). As the Alabama Supreme Court
held in  Allstate Ins. Co. v. Ware,  824 So. 2d 739, 744 (Ala. 2002):

T he propriety of class certification does not depend on whether
the putative class members will be able to prove the claims on the
merits. In other words, a court deciding the issue of the propriety
of class certification does not base the decision on the factual
merits of the alleged class claims.

Bearing in mind the Alabama Supreme Court s directive not to prejudge the merits of the
proposed class claims at the certification stage, the Court will now address the requisites for
class certification.

6

A.    Numerosity   . 

The requirement of Rule 23(a)(1)  relates to the difficulty or inconvenience in joining
class members.   Ex parte Government Employees Insurance Co.,  729 So, 2d 299, 303 (Ala. 1999).
 Practicality of joinder is the primary issue in assessing whether the numerosity requirement of
Rule 23(a )(1) is satisfied.   Winn v. Dixieland Food Stores, Inc.,  125 F.R.D. 696,699 (M.D. Ala.
1989). An approximation of the potential number of class members will suffice in determining
numerosity.  Ex parte Government Employees Insurance Co.,  729 So. 2d at 303.

There is no dispute over the existence of this element. Block has admitted in its briefs that
the Class consists of tens of thousands of members. Block s answers to Plaintiffs  First Set of
Interrogatories represented that In excess of 32,000 persons obtained RALs in 1993 and 1994 alone.
Edward Feinstein, Block s 30(b)(6) corporate representative, testified that between 40% and 95% of
all Block clients who electronically file their returns utilize the RAL program.

The Court therefore finds that the Plaintiffs have proven that numerosity is present in this
case.

B.    Commonality   . 

The commonality requirement has been liberally construed, and It is aimed at determining
whether there is a need for combined treatment and a benefit to be
derived therefrom.   Ex parte
Government Employees Insurance Co.,  729 So. 2d at 304 (citation omitted).   T here need be only a
single issue common to all members of the class.  Alba Conte   Herbert Newberg, 1  Newberg  on  Class
Actions,    3:10, pp. 273-78
(4 th  ed. 2002).

7

A common nucleus of operative facts is usually enough to satisfy the commonality requirement
of Rule 23(a)(2).   Cheminova America Corp. v. Corker,  779 So. 2d 1175,1180 (Ala. 2000).

When the party opposing the class has engaged in some course of
conduct that affects a group of persons and gives rise to a cause of
action, one or more of the elements of that cause of action will be
common to all of the persons affected.

1  Newberg on Class Actions,    3:10 at 273-78. That is precisely what has occurred here:
Block, through its RAL program, has engaged in a course of conduct that affected all members of
the Class, a course of conduct which Plaintiffs allege has given rise to causes of action. There
is a  common nucleus of operative facts  with respect to all Class members. Plaintiffs have
identified the following issues of law and fact which the Court finds to be common to all members
of the Class:

a. 
       
     Whether Block acted as the agent of the Plaintiffs in
transmitting the RAL applications to the lender banks. 

b. 
       
     Whether Block acted as the agent of the Plaintiffs in
disclosing to the lender banks information supplied by Plaintiffs to
Block, including Plaintiffs  tax returns and the information contained
therein. 

c. 
       
     Whether Block used the information supplied to it by
Plaintiffs and disclosed by Block to the lender banks for the purpose of
its own financial gain. 

d. 
       
     Whether Block received license fees because of an agency
relationship with the Plaintiffs. 

e. 
       
     Whether Block received profits from its participation in
the pooling agreements with the lender banks. 

f. 
       
     Whether Block owed a fiduciary duty to Plaintiffs to
disclose to them that it would receive as a license fee from the lender
banks part of the finance charge for the RALs that Plaintiffs 

8

paid to the lender banks, and whether Block owed a fiduciary
duty not to receive such an undisclosed license fee. 

g. 
       
     Whether Block owed a fiduciary duty to
the Plaintiffs to reveal its relationships with the lender
banks, to disclose that it was receiving profits from its use of
the information supplied to it by Plaintiffs and disclosed by
Block to the lender banks, and not to receive undisclosed
profits from the lender banks. 

h. 
       
     Whether Block contracted with Plaintiffs
not to use for its own financial gain the Information supplied
by Plaintiffs to Block and disclosed by Block to the lender
banks, and if so, whether Block breached that contract. 

i. 
       
     Whether Block has been unjustly enriched
because it received or holds money which In equity and good
conscience belongs to Plaintiffs, or because Plaintiffs
conferred benefits upon Block as a result of detriment suffered
by Plaintiffs. 

The Court finds that Plaintiffs have proven the existence of the commonality
requirement.

C .   Typicality  .

The claims of the class representatives must be typical of the claims of the class.

A representative s claim is typical  if it  arises from the same event or practice or
course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class
members and ...  is  based
on the same legal theory.   Cheminova America Corp. v. Corker,  779 So. 2d at 1180-81
(alternations in original). The typicality requirement tests whether  the claims of the
named plaintiffs have the same essential characteristics as the class at large.   Id.  at
1180 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Where, as here,  the party seeking certification
alleges that the same unlawful conduct was directed at the class representatives and the
class itself, the typicality requirement is usually met irrespective of the varying fact
patterns which underlie individual claims.   Id.  (quoting  Appleyard v. Wallace,  754 F.2d
955,958 (11 th Cir. 1985)).

9

" T ypicality of claims seeks to assure that the interests of the representative are
aligned with the common questions affecting the class.  1  Newberg on Class Actions,   
3:13 at 319.

The Court will now apply these legal principles to the claims which Plaintiffs seek
to have certified for class treatment.

1 .   The Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claim  .

Plaintiffs  breach of fiduciary duty claim is based upon the following
provision contained in Plaintiffs  1995 (tax year 1994) RAL application:

On the date I sign this application, I hereby authorize and
request H R Block and its affiliates to disclose to
Beneficial National Bank and its agents ( BNB ) my federal
income tax return for tax year 1994, any and all other
information contained in such tax return, all information
supplied to H R Block, including IRS direct deposit
information, In connection with the preparation of such tax
return, and all other information contained in this form and
any Information contained in any of my prior RAL applications
which was disclosed to H R Block. I authorize and consent to
the disclosure of all the foregoing information for the
purpose of enabling BNB to determine whether or not to make a
Refund Anticipation Loan ( RAL ) to me in response to my
application for such loan which is a part of this form.... H R
Block may not use or disclose such tax return information or
such other information for any purpose (not otherwise
permitted under Treas. Reg. Sec. 301.7216-2) other than as
stated herein, except that BNB or its affiliates may use such
Information to conduct system testing of the RAL program to
update such system and keep it operational.

The Class Definitions reflect this provision of the Plaintiffs  RAL application.
Therefore, if an Alabama resident who obtained a RAL during the Class Periods did not
use a RAL application with the above or substantially similar language, that person is
not a member of the Class. The RAL applications introduced into evidence indicate that
in

10

Alabama for calendar years 1989 through 1996, only one lending institution, for
only one year, did not use this RAL provision or a materially identical
provision.

Plaintiffs  breach of fiduciary duty claim is based upon agency. The test
for determining whether an agency relationship exists is whether the alleged
principal reserved a right of control over the manner of the alleged agent s
performance.  Thrash v. Credit Acceptance Corp.,  821 So. 2d 968, 972 (Ala. 2001).
An agent engaged for a specific purpose is a special agent for that limited
purpose only.  City Stores Company v. Williams,  252 So. 2d 45, 51 (Ala. 1971).
Plaintiffs allege that the above-quoted language of the RAL application made
Block the special agent of its customers, for the limited purpose of transmitting
their tax return information (and other information acquired by Block from them)
to the lending institution.

The RAL application authorizes Block to disclose its customers  tax and
other information to the lending institution. This disclosure is for a specific
purpose:  for the purpose of enabling  the lending institution  to determine
whether or not to make a Refund Anticipation Loan.  The RAL application further
provides:  H R Block may not use or disclose such tax return information or such
other information for any purpose (not
otherwise permitted under Treas. Reg. Sec. 301.7216-2) other than as
stated herein.... 
Neither the RAL application nor the referenced treasury regulation permit
Block to use its customers  information for its own financial gain.

Block acts on behalf of its customer in transmitting the customer s information to the
lending institution. The disclosure of information is made for the specific purpose of
enabling the lending institution to decide whether to extend a RAL to the customer. The

11

RAL application specifically prohibits Block from using or disclosing the information for any
other purpose.

Plaintiffs allege that this restriction upon Block s use of the customer s tax and other
information, contained in the RAL application which is signed by the customer, gives the customer
the right of control over the manner in which Block uses the information. As such, Plaintiffs
allege, the test for an agency relationship is satisfied. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that this
restriction makes Block the special agent of its customer for the limited purpose of transmitting
the customer s information to the lending institution.

It is well established that an agent owes a fiduciary duty to his principal within the line
and scope of the agency.  Miller v. Jackson Hospital and Clinic,  776 So. 2d 122,123 (Ala. 2000).
The fiduciary obligation includes disclosure of all material facts within the subject matter of
the agency,  id ., and prohibits an agent from profiting from the subject matter of the agency
without the principal s consent.  Gardner v. Cumis Ins. Society, Inc.,  582 So. 2d 1094,1096 (Ala.
1991). Plaintiffs allege that Block breached its fiduciary duty to the class members when it used
or disclosed their tax information, a matter within the scope of Block s special agency, to the
lending institutions for Block s own profit, to obtain license fees and an ownership interest in
the RALs, and when Block failed to disclose these profits and its true relationship with the
lending institutions to the class members.

In the prior appeal of this case, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed the denial of class
certification by this Court s predecessor judge, on the ground that the Court improperly
considered the merits of Plaintiffs  breach of fiduciary duty claim  by adjudicating, during the
class certification hearing, the issue whether the loan documents and the restrictions contained
in those documents created an agency relationship.   Mitchell 

12

v.
H R Block, Inc.,  783 So. 2d 812, 815 (Ala. 2000). The Alabama Supreme Court
further held:

T he contractual-agency issue requires the trial court to
do nothing more than look to see if a uniform document
existed and whether it was used uniformly by H R Block.

Id.  at 816. Plaintiffs  breach of fiduciary duty claim is based entirely upon what
the Alabama Supreme Court termed  the contractual-agency issue.  In this regard, and
pursuant to the Alabama Supreme Court s instruction, this Court finds that a uniform
document existed and that it was used uniformly by H R Block. As noted, with the
exception of the RAL application used by one lending institution for one year during the
calendar years 1989 through 1996, the RAL applications used by H R Block and its
franchisee offices in the State of Alabama contained the provision quoted above, or a
provision which was identical in all material respects. Thus, the Named Plaintiffs 
breach of fiduciary duty claim is typical of the Class members  breach of fiduciary duty
claim.

Consistent with the Alabama Supreme Court s admonition not to adjudicate the merits
of a claim in determining the propriety of class certification, the Court specifically
does not reach the issue of whether this provision in the RAL applications created a
special-agency relationship between Block and his customers, which would correspondingly
give rise to a fiduciary duty on Block s part within the line and scope of that agency.
The Court does find, however, that the existence of a special-agency relationship and
corresponding fiduciary duty can be determined based solely upon the uniform provision
used by Block in its RAL applications on a class-wide basis. Either the language of this
provision creates a special-agency relationship, or it does not. In this regard, it is
important to note the manner in which the Plaintiffs have framed their claim. Plaintiffs
do

13

not rely on anything outside the RAL application as having created an agency relationship and
fiduciary duty. Plaintiffs  claim is based solely upon the language of the RAL application
itself.

2.    The Unjust Enrichment Claim   . 

A claim for unjust enrichment lies where the defendant holds money which in equity
and good conscience belongs to the plaintiff,  Dickinson v. Cosmos Broadcasting Co.,  782 So. 2d
260, 266 (Ala. 2000), or where the plaintiff, to his detriment, has conferred a benefit upon
the defendant.  Opelika Production Credit Ass n., Inc. v. Lamb,  361 So. 2d 95, 99 (Ala, 1978).
Plaintiffs  unjust enrichment claim is entirely derivative of their breach of fiduciary duty
claim. This is abundantly clear from the allegations of Plaintiffs  Complaint as last amended.
Stated differently, the unjust enrichment claim will rise or fall based upon the same proof as
Plaintiffs  breach of fiduciary duty claim. Thus, it can be determined based upon the same
provision uniformly used by Block in its RAL applications on a classwide basis.

As such, Plaintiffs  unjust enrichment claim is typical of the Class Members  unjust
enrichment claims. In making this determination, the Court does not consider the merits of
the unjust enrichment claim.

3.    The Breach of Contract Claim   . 

Plaintiffs  breach of contract claim is also based entirely upon the same uniform
language contained in the RAL applications as the breach of fiduciary duty claim. Plaintiffs 
claim is based upon an allegation of a unilateral contract.

A  unilateral contract results from an exchange of a promise for
an act; a bilateral contract results from an exchange of
promises.  Citations omitted . Thus, in a unilateral contract,

14

there is no bargaining process or exchange of promises by
parties as in a bilateral contract.  Citation omitted .
 O nly one
party makes an offer (or promise) which invites performance by
another, and performance constitutes both acceptance of that offer
and consideration.  Citation omitted . Because a unilateral contract
is one in which no promisor receives promise as consideration for
his promise, only one party is bound.

SouthTrust Bank v. Williams,  775 So. 2d 184,188 (Ala. 2000) (alterations in original; internal
quotation marks deleted). Plaintiffs allege that Block promised (or offered) in the above-quoted
provision of the RAL application to transmit its customers  tax (and other) information to a
lending institution, for the purpose of enabling a lender to determine whether to extend a RAL, and
further promised not to use the customer s tax information for any other purpose. Plaintiffs allege
that this promise (or offer) invited performance by the customer: execution of the RAL application
authorizing the release of the customer s tax information to the lending institution. Plaintiffs
further allege that such a performance by the customer constituted both acceptance of Block s offer
and consideration. Plaintiffs contend that Block breached the alleged unilateral contract when it
used its customers  tax information to generate profit for itself, as discussed above   a purpose
allegedly prohibited by the unilateral contract.

The Court finds that because the Plaintiffs allege the existence of a contract which is
unilateral, as opposed to bilateral (a promise for a promise), the merits of this claim can be
resolved solely by reference to the uniform provision quoted above in the RAL applications
uniformly used by Block. As noted above, the Alabama Supreme Court has held that there is no
bargaining process between the parties to a unilateral contract. As such, under the Plaintiffs 
breach of unilateral contract theory, the Court will not need to

15

examine the state of mind of the individual Class members. Therefore, the named
Plaintiffs  breach of contract claims are typical of the breach of contract claims of the
Class members.

The Court does not address the merits of the Plaintiffs  breach of contract claim at
this stage of the proceedings.

4 .   Block s Challenges to Typicality  .

Block challenges Plaintiffs  proof of the typicality requirement in several respects.
Initially, the Court notes that Block has advanced several arguments which are not directed
to any specific class certification factor, but rather, are in actuality merits arguments.
The Court will discuss these arguments now.

Block contended at oral argument that it did not receive license fees from its
franchisee offices, as opposed to Block-owned offices. If true, this would significantly
reduce the size of the Class, since the vast majority of Block s offices in Alabama are
franchisee-owned. However, whether Block received license fees from its franchisee offices
is a merits issue, not a certification issue, and hence is not germane at this stage of
the proceedings. Whether Plaintiffs can actually prove their claims against Block, one
element of which is whether Block received license fees for its RALs during the Class
Periods, is not an issue during class certification. Pursuant to
 Ala ,  Code  1975   6-5-641
(c), all discovery directed to the merits of Plaintiffs  claims has been stayed. Thus,
whether Block received license fees from its franchisee offices has not been fully
developed, and is not ripe for adjudication in any event. Moreover, the Court notes that
the deposition of

16

Harry W. Buckley (Plaintiffs  Supplemental Notice of Filing, Exh. 9, p. 135) indicates that Block
did receive license fees from its franchisee-owned offices. 6 

Similarly, whether Block received any license fees before 1992 is a merits issue, and has not
been fully developed because merits discovery has been stayed.

Block also contends that it, as opposed to its franchisees, did not participate in pooling
agreements in Alabama during the Class Period. Whether or not Block profited directly from the
pooling agreements is a merits question. Moreover, even if only Block s franchisees directly
participated in pooling agreements, that does not necessarily mean that Block did not ultimately
profit from those pooling agreements, which could constitute a breach of the fiduciary duty alleged
by Plaintiffs, Again, this is a merits question, which has not been fully developed.

Block also contends that the breach of contract claim is defective because Plaintiffs 
Complaint supposedly shows that Plaintiffs have not been damaged in this respect. This contention
is based upon the following: with respect to their breach of contract claim, Plaintiffs allege
that had Block not received license fees from lending institutions, Plaintiffs would have paid a
correspondingly lower finance charge to the lending institutions for their RALs. (Plaintiffs 
Fourth Amended Complaint,   37). 7  Plaintiffs stipulate that the lending institutions did
not charge any excessive or unlawful interest rates, finance charges or loan

6   
     Defendants  Motion to Exclude Plaintiffs  Supplemental Exhibit 9 is denied for
the reasons set out in Plaintiffs  Response thereto. 

7   
     In Block s original brief opposing certification, it alleges, in footnote 11,
that the license fee did not affect the cost of the finance charge to the RAL customer. There is no
evidence to support this conclusory assertion. Moreover, whether the inclusion of the
license fee increased the total finance charge to the customer is a merits question. 

17

fees, and further allege that the interest rates, finance charges, and loan fees charged by the
lending institutions  are not an element of plaintiffs  causes of actions set out herein. 
(Plaintiffs  Fourth Amended Complaint,   11). Thus, says Block, if the finance charges are not an
element of the breach of contract claim, Plaintiffs have no damages. Block has misread Plaintiffs 
Complaint. Plaintiffs allege that license fee paid to Block constitutes a portion of the finance
charge paid by Plaintiffs to the lending institutions. Simply because the lending institutions 
finance charges were not excessive does not mean that they would not have been less had there been
no license fee included as a component. Plaintiffs correctly allege that the finance charges
charged by the lending institutions are not an element of their claim. This is because Plaintiffs
do not attack the total amount of the finance charge actually charged by the lending institutions;
rather, Plaintiffs seek to recover the license fee component of the finance charge from Block, for
alleged breach of contract. 8 

Proceeding to Block s direct attacks upon the typicality requirement, Block contends that the
named Plaintiffs are not members of the Class they seek to represent. Block bases this contention
upon the following: the Fourth Amended Class Action Complaint alleges that the class members
obtained a loan from banks, for which they paid a finance charge, and alleges that Block should not
have received part of the bank s finance charge as a  kickback,  while the Mitchells believe that
they received their refund payment directly from Block, and believe that they paid Block a charge
for this service.

First, Block s argument is factually incorrect. Mrs. Mitchell testified in her deposition
that although she misunderstood the nature of the RAL transaction when it occurred, at the

8   
     Block s Motion to Dismiss the contract claim is denied without prejudice. Block
can reassert this motion during the merits phase of this case, if it chooses to do so. 

18

time of her deposition she understood that she had received a loan from a bank, and further
testified that she was complaining about a secret  kickback  to Block. Although Mr. Mitchell
displayed confusion in his deposition, both he and Mrs. Mitchell have since filed affidavits in
which they testify that they have now learned (after their depositions) 9  that they
received a loan from a bank, that Block received a secret  kickback  and otherwise profited from
the transaction, and that they are asserting claims on behalf of the Class for this alleged
self-profiteering.

Second, Block s argument is immaterial. What Plaintiffs and the Class members  thought  is not
a fact of consequence to the Plaintiffs  claims as they have been framed and as they are based on
the uniform Block RAL documents.  How the parties characterize the relationship is of no
consequence; it is the facts of the relationship that control.   Thrash v. Credit Acceptance Corp., 
821 So. 2d at 972 (discussing agency). Moreover,   i f relations exist which will constitute an
agency, it will be an agency whether the parties understood the exact nature of the relation or
not.   Storey v. Corkren,  156 So. 2d 484,487 (Ala. 1963). If a limited-purpose agency relationship
existed between Block and Its customers, Block s reaping of a profit from the subject matter of its
agency was illegal as a matter of law.  Miller v. Jackson Hospital and Clinic,  776 So. 2d at 124
( acts of an agent which tend to violate  his  fiduciary obligation are prima facie voidable, and
are considered, in law, as  frauds upon confidence bestowed    Gardner v. Cumis Insurance Society,
Inc.,  582 So. 2d at 1096 (  An  agent may not
 t raffic with the subject-matter of his

     The Court has considered the Plaintiffs  affidavits because the affidavits
explain any inconsistency between the testimony contained therein and the Plaintiffs  depositions:
the Plaintiffs were apprised of certain facts after their depositions had taken place. 

19

agency, without the consent of his principal, so as to reap the profit for himself. ) (alterations
in original   citation omitted);  Sevigny v. New South Federal Savings   Loan Assoc.,  586 So. 2d
884,887 (Ala. 1991) ( An agent is not permitted to occupy a position that would allow her to
profit as a result of that agency relationship. ). Thus, the mental operations of the Plaintiffs
and the class members, as to what they may have thought the RAL transactions were about, are
irrelevant. If there was an agency relationship based upon the uniform Block RAL documents, and
Block profited from the subject matter of its agency, those profits were illegally obtained.
Similarly, if the unambiguous language of the RAL application created a unilateral contract
whereby Block promised not to use its customers  information for its own financial gain, it is
immaterial what the Mitchells (or the Class members) may have subjectively thought about the
nature of the transaction. 10 

Block also contends that the named Plaintiffs fail the typicality test because of a
disclosure contained on the back of one of their RAL checks. On the back of the named Plaintiffs 
1994 (tax year 1993) RAL check is the statement that the customer s electronic filer (Block)  may 
receive a portion of the bank s finance charge. 11  Thus, says Block, the

10   
     The law of contracts is based upon the objective, not subjective, intent of the
parties, as derived from the contract itself, where the language is unambiguous.  Murray
v. Alfab, Inc.,  601 So. 2d 878, 886 (Ala. 1992).   Agreement consists of mutual
expressions; it does not consist of harmonious intentions or states
of mind....  One  may
be  bound  by a contract in ways that he did not intend, foresee, or understand. The juristic
effect (the resulting legal relations) of a man s expressions in word or act may be very
different from what he supposed it would be.   Lilley v. Gonzales,  417 So. 2d 161,163 (Ala.
1982) (quoting A. Corbin,  Corbin on Contracts,    9). 

11   
     The claims for which the Named Plaintiffs seek class certification are based
upon their 1995 (tax year 1994) RAL transaction. 

20

named Plaintiffs cannot represent the class members on their claim that the license fee was
not disclosed. 12 

This contention is erroneous because the purported disclosure on the back of the check came
too late. Block s duty as set out in the RAL applications was to transmit its customers 
information to the lender banks. If Block owed a fiduciary duty because of a special agency,
Block s obligation was to disclose its profits before the customer signed the RAL application, or
at least before Block accepted its appointment as a special agent by transmitting the customer s
information to the lender bank. Because of Block s pre-existing agreement with the lender banks for
the receipt of license fees, its after-the-fact disclosure of its profits, after it had completed
its business on behalf of its alleged principal, and allegedly used the customer s tax information
for its own profit, was meaningless. 13  For Identical reasons, Plaintiffs  breach of
contract claim is unaffected by the tardy disclosure.

Moreover, the purported disclosure was ineffective for another reason. The disclosure recites
that the customer s electronic filer (Block)  may  receive a portion of the lender bank s finance
charge. However, in actuality it was a certainty that the electronic

12  
       
     Block also contends that this disclosure effectively moots the class members 
claims for 1994 (tax year 1993), because all the RAL checks for that year (according to
Block) contained this disclosure. This contention is incorrect for the same reasons that
Block s typicality argument is without merit, as discussed herein. 

13  
       
     Block contends that the RAL transaction is not complete until the customer
endorses the RAL check, because until that moment, the customer is free to cancel the
transaction. (Block s Post-Hearing Brief, p. 11 n. 6). This is true insofar as the lending
institution is concerned. However, if a fiduciary duty existed, Block s obligation was to
disclose the license fee to its customer before Block used the customer s tax information
for its own profit   which use occurred when Block transmitted the customer s tax
information to the lender bank, because of Block s preexisting license fee agreement with
the lender banks. 

21

filer would receive a portion of the bank s finance charge in the form of a license fee, because of
the preexisting license fee arrangements with the lender banks.  To warn that the untoward may
occur when the event is contingent is prudent; to caution that it is only possible for the
unfavorable events to happen when they have already occurred Is deceit.   Huddleston v. Herman  
MacLean,  640 F.2d 534, 544 (5 th  Clr, 1981),  reversed on other grounds, Herman   MacLean
v, Huddleston,  459 U.S. 375 (1983). Thus, the purported disclosure was ineffective for this reason
as well. 14 

For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs have proven that their claims
are typical of the claims of the class members.

D.  Adequacy . 

The Class Representatives must fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. The
purpose of this requirement  is to protect the legal rights of absent class members.   Kirkpatrick
v. J. C. Bradford    Co., 827 F. 2d 718, 726 (11th Cir. 1987). In Alabama, the adequacy requirement
has two elements.  The adequacy-of-representation inquiry involves questions as to whether the
plaintiffs counsel are qualified, experienced, and generally able to conduct the proposed
litigation, and as to whether the plaintiffs have interests antagonistic to those of the rest of
the class.   Ex parte Government Employees Ins. Co.,  729
So. 2d at 309;  accord, Cheminova,  779 So.
2d at 1181.

14  
       
     Block argued in Its original brief opposing class certification that this
purported disclosure put Plaintiffs and the Class members on notice for subsequent years that
Block  may  receive part of the finance charge for the RAL. This argument has been abandoned
because it was not raised at the certification hearing or in Block s Post-Hearing Brief. In any
event, the false disclosure which treated a certainty as a contingency was Ineffective to place
Plaintiffs and the Class members on notice that Block  would  receive a license fee in
subsequent years, Finally, a disclosure in one year does not carry over to a subsequent year when
the RAL documents were silent. 

22

Here, the named Plaintiffs have no interests antagonistic to those of the class they seek to
represent. There are no internal conflicts of interest; the interests of the named Plaintiffs are
coextensive with those of the class members. Proposed counsel for the Class have substantial
experience pursuing complex litigation generally, and consumer class litigation in particular. The
adequacy requirement is satisfied.

Block has also contended in its original brief that the Mitchells are inadequate class
representatives because they supposedly do not understand the nature of their claims or the nature
of the class action mechanism, and because they are unable to fund the costs of notice to the
class. Block did not raise these issues at the certification hearing or in its Post-Hearing Brief.
Therefore, the Court deems these contentions to have been abandoned. Moreover, the Court notes
that the Plaintiffs  affidavits on file recite that since their depositions, they have been made
aware of the nature of their claims and the nature of their fiduciary responsibilities to the
class, and that they have made arrangements with their attorneys to provide for class notice.

The Court finds that the Plaintiffs have proven that they will fairly and adequately protect
the interests of the class.

The Court now turns to the requirements of Ala.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3).

E.  Predominance . 

Questions of law or fact common to the members of the class must predominate over any
questions affecting only individual members. The predominance test requires   T he existence of a
group which is more bound together by a mutual interest in the settlement of common questions than
it is divided by the individual members  interest in matters peculiar to them.   Ex parte AmSouth
Bancorporation,  717 So. 2d 357,363 (Ala.

23

1998).  In deciding whether common questions of fact or law predominate, a court must examine each
plaintiffs cause of action and consider what value the resolution of the class-wide issue will
have in each class member s underlying cause of action.   Reynolds Metals Co. v, Hill,  825 So. 2d
100, 104 (Ala. 2002) (citation omitted). Stated differently,  To predominate, common issues must
constitute a significant part of individual class members  cases.   Cheminova,  779 So. 2d at 1181.

In the case  sub judice,  the Class members  claims are all dependent upon standardized RAL
documents uniformly used by Block in a classwide manner. As such, resolution of the classwide
issues based upon these uniform documents will be dispositive of each class member s cause of
action.

Block contends that predominance is defeated as to each of the Plaintiffs  claims because,
Block says, the pertinent language of the RAL application is ambiguous, and therefore, presents
individual questions of document interpretation. The Court disagrees.  An ambiguity exists where a
term is reasonably subject to more than one interpretation.   Ex parte Awtrey Realty Co., Inc.,  827
So. 2d 104,107 (Ala. 2001).  The mere fact that adverse parties contend for different constructions
does not in itself force the conclusion that the disputed language is ambiguous.   Id.  Objectively
viewed, the pertinent language of the RAL application is, obviously, not reasonably subject to more
than one interpretation:  H R Block may not use or disclose such tax return information or such
other information for any purpose (not otherwise permitted under Treas. Reg. Sec. 301.7216-2) other
than as stated herein...  The Court discerns no ambiguity here. This straightforward language means
what it says.

24

Block further contends that the predominance requirement is not met because the agency issue
would require a determination of whether each individual class member reserved a right of control
over Block s actions. Block is incorrect. As discussed, the agency issue can be determined based
solely upon the uniform language contained in the RAL applications. An examination of each class
member s state of mind is unnecessary and irrelevant. As Block admits in its Post-Hearing Brief,
 Whether relations exist which will constitute an agency in this case depends on the relations of
the parties as they exist  under their agreements.   (Block s Post-Hearing Brief, p. 10) (quotation
marks deleted and emphasis added). The agreements in this case are uniform written documents.

Block further contends that predominance is destroyed with respect to the breach of fiduciary
duty claim because Block, as an alleged agent, must have failed to disclose a  material  fact. Block
has produced affidavits from some of its customers stating that the existence of the license fee
was of no consequence to them. Thus, Block reasons, predominance is destroyed because there must
be an individualized determination of whether each class member thought the undisclosed license
fee was important or not. This contention fails because, as discussed, an agent s failure to
disclose profit reaped from the subject matter of the agency is
illegal   and therefore material   as a matter of law. Thus, the various class members  personal beliefs about the propriety of
the license fee are irrelevant.

Block further contends that the predominance requirement is not met because the Class
includes persons who obtained RALs from Block franchisees (as the Mitchells did), as well as
persons who obtained RALs from Block-owned offices. Block points out that the franchisees are
independent entities, and that Block cannot be liable for their actions unless

25

they acted as Block s agents. Block argues that a determination of agency would require numerous
mini-trials on whether each of the approximately 190 Block franchisees in Alabama was acting as
Block s agent at any given time. Therefore, says Block, either predominance is completely
destroyed, or at the least, the class must be limited  to  persons who obtained their RALs from
Block-owned offices.

The Court disagrees. The Court finds that whether Block franchisees were acting as Block s
agents can be determined from the RAL documents, based upon the
well-established concept of implied agency.

While the creation of an agency relationship, so far as the
principal and agent are concerned, arises from their consent
and usually as the result of a contract, it is not essential that
any actual contract exist or that compensation be expected by
the agent or agreed to by the parties. While the relationship,
in its full sense, arises out of a contractual or gratuitous
agreement between the parties,... the agency and the assent
of the parties thereto may be either express or implied...

An express agency is an actual agency created as a result of the
oral or written agreement of the parties, and an implied agency is
also an actual agency, the existence of which as a fact is proved by
deductions or inferences from the other facts and circumstances of
the particular case, including the words and conduct of the parties.

Fisher
v. Comer Plantation, Inc.,  772 So. 2d 455, 465 (Ala. 2000)
(quoting 3 Am.Jur.2d  Agency    18 (1986)).

In the case  sub judice,  whether the various franchisees were acting as Block s agents for the
purpose of the RAL transactions can be determined solely from the RAL applications themselves. The
following observations apply to all RAL applications for calendar years 1989 through 1996, with
the sole exception of the 1994 (tax year 1993) Mellon Bank RAL application: The RAL applications
are all replete with references to  H R

26

Block  and  H R Block, Inc.  For several years, the RAL applications state that the customer s
signature must be witnessed by  H R Block.  As discussed, the RAL applications all provide that
 H R Block  can only use the customer s
information for specified purposes, not including for Its
own financial gain. Significantly, all the RAL applications also authorize  H R Block  to disclose
the customer s tax information to the lender banks. Just as significantly, the RAL applications
over this period of years all authorize  H R Block  to transmit the customer s loan request to the
lender bank.

This is evidence of a longstanding pattern of conduct from which agency or the absence
thereof should be determinable on a classwide basis pursuant to the implied agency principle, with
respect to all Block franchisees, solely from the language of the RAL documents.

At the certification hearing, Block challenged predominance by raising the issue of
arbitration. However, Block s counsel specifically conceded that arbitration  is not a big issue 
at this juncture. That is an accurate characterization of the arbitration issue.

The arbitration issue arises because beginning in calendar year 1997 (tax year 1996), all
Block customers signed retroactive arbitration agreements. 15  Thus, Block can raise
arbitration as an issue with respect to any Class members who, after the Class Periods, did further
business with Block. First, this is a merits issue. Second, if Block prevails on an arbitration
defense, it will be a simple matter to identify those Class members who did business with Block
after the expiration of the Class Period and signed retroactive arbitration agreements. Block
possesses the names, dates of birth, and social security

27

numbers of all of its customers for any given year; this information is contained on the RAL
applications. A computer can eliminate from the Class all Class members who did subsequent business
with Block (and thereby signed an arbitration agreement) in very short order. The Court notes that
Block has not raised arbitration in any manner other than with respect to the predominance
requirement.

The Court finds that Plaintiffs have proven that questions of law or fact common to the
members of the Class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.

F.    Superiority  .

There are four factors pertinent to this criterion.

The interest of Class members in individually controlling the prosecution of separate actions
against Block is nonexistent because most or all of the Class members have damage claims that are
uneconomical to pursue individually.   O ne of the primary functions of the class suit is to
provide a device for vindicating claims which, taken individually, are too small to justify legal
action but which are of significant size if taken as a group.   Brady v. LAC, Inc.,  72 F.R.D. 22,28
(S.D.N.Y. 1976).

It is clearly desirable to concentrate the litigation of these claims in one forum, as
opposed to litigating the thousands of statewide Class members  claims on an individual,
repetitive basis.

Management of the action should not pose any difficulty. As discussed, this action is based
upon written documents, and uniform provisions contained therein, which were used in a uniform
manner. Block is in possession of the social security numbers and addresses of its customers, and
has detailed information concerning past class members,

28

so that identification and notification of class members and distribution of benefits to them
should pose no difficulty. Calculation of damages on a classwide basis will pose no manageability
problems. Plaintiffs have proffered expert testimony that damages can readily be calculated on a
classwide basis. With respect to the license fee, the only variable is that the amount of the
license fee varied from year to year, and the amount of the license fee in a given year is known.
Information in Block s possession will reflect which Alabamians purchased RALs in a given year.
With respect to the pooling agreements, Plaintiffs  expert has testified that he can determine the
amount of profit realized by Block from each Alabama RAL customer based upon an examination of
books and records. Plaintiffs  expert opines that all damages determinations can be made through
simple arithmatical calculations based upon generally accepted accounting principles.

The final superiority factor is the pendency of other litigation. Neither the Court nor the
parties are aware of any individual litigation concerning this controversy already commenced by
members of the class. A national class action involving Block s RAL program has been commenced in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. A settlement was reached
and approved, and objectors appealed. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit remanded the case for a redetermination of the settlement s fairness and adequacy before a
different district judge.  Reynolds v. Beneficial National Bank,  288 F.3d 277 (7 th  Cir.
2002). On remand, the federal district court rejected the settlement, and disqualified the
attorneys representing the settlement class, on the ground that they were inadequate
representatives.  Reynolds v. Beneficial National Bank,  2003 WL 1877416 (N.D. III.). Among other
things, the district court found that formal discovery undertaken by settlement class counsel was

29

nonexistent.   Id.  at *5, *7. Thus, the national class action appears to be back at square one.
With the national class action in this posture, the Court finds that this Alabama-only class
action is a superior vehicle for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy in
Alabama.

Therefore, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs have proven that the instant class action is
superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.

III.    CONCLUSION  

Based upon the foregoing, the Court finds, after a rigorous analysis, that the Plaintiffs have
carried their burden of proving the requisites for maintaining this action as a class action as set
out in Ala.R.Civ.P. 23(a) and 23(b)(3). Accordingly, the Court certifies Plaintiffs  claims for
breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment and breach of contract as a class action pursuant to
Ala.R.Civ.P. 23(a) and 23(b)(3). The Court adopts the Class and Class Periods set out hereinabove
in the Class Definition.

The Court notes that class certification is inherently conditional, and that as the case
proceeds, this certification order can be vacated, modified, or further subclasses carved out, as
may be appropriate,

The Court appoints as Lead Class Counsel, Steven A. Martino, W. Lloyd Copeland, and Taylor,
Martino   Hedge, P.C.. The Court appoints as Class Counsel, Michael B. Hyman, Much, Shelist,
Freed, Denenberg, Ament   Rubenstein, P.C., Steven E. Angstreich, Levy, Angstreich, Finney,
Baldante, Rubenstein   Coren, P.C.

The Court is aware that Block has the right to appeal this Order within 42 days pursuant to
 Ala, Code  1975   6-5-642. If Block does not appeal, Lead Class Counsel are

30

directed to propose a Class Notice Plan within 15 days from the expiration of the 42 day
appeal period. If Block does appeal, and this Order is affirmed, Lead Class Counsel are directed
to propose a Class Notice Plan within 15 days after the issuance of the Alabama Supreme Court s
certificate of judgment.

***********************************************************************************************************

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER 

This action was initiated by Plaintiff Joyce A. Green individually, and on behalf of
all persons whose income tax forms were prepared at any H   R Block office or facility located in
the State of Maryland who had participated in H   R Block s Rapid Refund Program by obtaining a
Refund Anticipation Loan ( RAL ) during the time period January 1,1992 to the present. The
Plaintiff has sued H   R Block, Inc., H   R Block Eastern Tax Services, Inc., H   R Block Tax
Services, Inc., and Block Financial Corporation (hereinafter referred to collectively as  Block ),
alleging deceptive and unfair practices, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraudulent concealment in
connection with the Refund Anticipation Loan ( RAL ) program.

The Plaintiff in her Complaint and various pleadings has detailed the process that a person
goes through to receive an RAL. After a taxpayer has his income tax form prepared by H   R Block,
he may elect to apply to a lender participating with Block to receive the refund amount, or a
portion of the refund, if it exceeds a certain amount, in the form of a loan. The taxpayer must pay
another charge for the loan, in addition to the tax preparation fee and the electronic filing fee,
which are also deducted from the loan, and ultimately paid from the taxpayer s actual refund. Along
with these is a finance charge which the Plaintiff alleges may reach $125. The loan proceeds are
generally made available to the taxpayer approximately two

to five days after the return is filed in the form of a check from Block which the taxpayer can
pick up at the Block office. The IRS is directed to electronically deposit the actual refund
directly with the lender bank at which time the bank deposits the proceeds into an account opened
in the taxpayer s name and uses that account to repay the loan. The Plaintiff alleges that she is
one of thousands of Maryland consumers that have used this RAL procedure.

Plaintiff alleges that the lender bank pays Block certain fees, or  kickbacks  for every RAL
that Block solicits or procures. Plaintiff alleges these fees are unauthorized and constitute a
conflict of interest, and violate Block s fiduciary duty to its taxpayer clients. Plaintiff also
alleges that Block advertises the RAL, along with its companion program, Rapid Refund, in such a
manner that makes customers believe they are receiving a refund, not a loan. Plaintiff has in its
pleadings noted various advertisements of the Rapid Refund Program which, in sum, always asks the
question,  Why wait for your tax refund, when you can get your money fast?  Plaintiff asserts that
the persons targeted by Block for these RALs are generally lower income, financially
unsophisticated persons who could not seek independent accountants, or lawyers, to help understand
what the RAL program really was designed to do. They therefore, expect to get their money within
two days and do believe that it is a refund as opposed to a loan against their refund. It is
exasperated by the fact that the Rapid Refund Program is advertised with the RAL program, and never
is the RAL program advertised alone. The Plaintiff also points out that Block receives another fee,
or kickback, if the RAL customer cashes the check at a Sears store.
According to the Amended Complaint, once a taxpayer comes into an H   R Block office, Block
employees are instructed to discuss RALs with any customer who qualifies, regardless of whether the
customer expresses any interest in the loan, or the so called  two day refund.  The

2

written forms also do not delineate the fees, or the true cost of the RAL, leaving the customers to
learn their actual interest rate when they receive their check, The complaint also notes that the
terms of the RAL agreement are not negotiable and that they are set
by the lending bank with
Block s input.

The Plaintiff alleges she participated in the H   R Block Rapid Refund Program in tax years
1991 through 1994, receiving RAL s in 1992 through 1995. She alleges she has been damaged by
participating in the Rapid Refund Program, and paying the exorbitant fees; that she has been
victimized by her agents/fiduciaries  undisclosed earning and by the violation of Block s fiduciary
duty owed to her as their customer.

The Plaintiff alleges she is not the lone victim of these unfair and deceptive tactics of
Block and therefore, has filed a Motion for Class Certification pursuant to Rule 2-23l(a) and (b)
(l)(b)(3) of the Maryland Rules of Procedure. The Plaintiff seeks to represent a class defined as
 all persons whose income tax forms were prepared at any H   R Block office, or facility located in
the State of Maryland, who have participated in H   R Block s Rapid Refund Program by obtaining a
Refund Anticipation Loan ( RAL ) at any time during the period from January 1, 1992 to the
present,  Various pleadings have been filed in this case, and Motions to Dismiss the Amended
Complaint were heard on May 15,2000 and were denied by this Court in a separate Opinion and Order
filed simultaneously with this Opinion and Order. Therefore, the named Defendants remain as H   R
Block, Inc., H   R Block Eastern Tax Services, Inc., H   R Block Tax Services, Inc., and Block
Financial Corporation. All Defendants have filed responses in opposition to the Motion for Class
Certification; and a hearing on the motion was held before this Court on May 15, 2000. Since the
Maryland Rules are very specific about the factors to be

3

considered in granting class certification, the Court will address the requirements under
those Rules by the factors enumerated in the Rule in that order.

A. 
       
      Rule 2-231(a)  

Rule 2-23l(a) provides as follows; One or more members of a class may sue or
be sued as representative parties on behalf of all only if (1) the class is so
numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions
of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the
representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and
(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the
interests of the class. 

1.    Numerosity  

As
the Court in  Albertini v. Pete, Marwick, Main   Co ., Case No.
90087031/CL111170 (Cir. Ct. Balto. City, Md., July 10,1992), correctly stated there is very little
appellate authority from the Maryland Courts providing guidance as to the criteria for
certification. However, in looking at the Federal Courts and other jurisdictions, the proper test
under this prong is whether the class is sufficiently numerous as to make joinder of all members
impracticable.  Albertini  also noted that a class of as few as twenty-five or thirty members
raises the presumption that joinder would be impracticable.

In the instant case, Plaintiff is requesting a certification of a class which could amount, by
the Defendant s own records provided at prior hearings, to thousands of Maryland residents. In
Defendant s Answer to the Plaintiffs Complaint, it noted that
Block is the largest tax preparation
in the United States, responsible for preparing between ten and twelve percent of all tax returns
filed with the Internal Revenue Service. In the Defendant s Memorandum in Opposition to the Motion
for Class Certification, Defendant skipped the first prong of  numerosity  altogether, merely
stating in a footnote that they stipulate that the proposed class presently meets the

4

numerosity requirement, and then proceeding to discuss nationwide settlements involving RALs in
which Block has entered into in other parts of the country. With that in mind, the Court finds no
reason to further discuss this first prong and finds that the Plaintiff has met its burden on
numerosity.

2.    Commonality  

The
second prong of Rule 2-231 (a) mandates that there be questions of low or
fact common to the class. This requirement is noted for its ability to be easily satisfied.

There is a strain of cases in favor of the proposition that where a proposed class action
stems from a comprehensive scheme or standardized  sales presentation  that involves uniform,
publicly distributed documents, or repetitive, uniform oral representations, or omitted material
facts, class certification has been found proper and warranted.  Sewell v. Sprint  PCS,
L.  P ., Case No. 9718802/CC3879 (Cir. Ct. Balt, City, Md., June 29,1998).;  Grainger v.
State Securities Life Ins. Co.,  547 F.2d 303 (5th Cir. 1977).;  Vasquez y. Superior
Court , 2 Cal. 3d 800 (1971).;  Pruitt v. Rockefeller Center
Properties Inc ., 574 N.Y.S.
2d 672 (1991).

The Judiciary recognizes the importance of class action treatment of fraud and negligent
misrepresentation claims in the context of protecting the consumer s rights. In  Vasquez, 
the Court noted that   p rotection of unwary consumers from being duped by unscrupulous sellers is
an exigency of the utmost priority in contemporary society,  (4 Cal. 3d at 808.) and that
" i ndividual actions by each of the defrauded consumers is often impracticable because the amount
of individual recovery would be insufficient to justify bringing a separate action (for each of
them); thus an unscrupulous seller retains the benefits of its wrongful conduct.  (Id.)

In this particular case, Plaintiffs argue that during the class period, Defendants
took part

5

in a concerted scheme to defraud citizens of our state by releasing false and misleading
information which omitted and misrepresented material facts. The Plaintiff alleges, inter alia, in
her Complaint that common questions of law and fact exist as to the following questions:

(1) 
       
     whether the Defendants fraudulently concealed the true
nature of the Rapid Refund Program and the fees associated with RALs; 

(2) 
       
     whether the Block Defendants owed to Plaintiff and the Class
the fiduciary duties of one standing in a confidential relationship
to another; 

(3) 
       
     whether the Block Defendants owed to Plaintiff and the Class
the fiduciary duties owed by an agent to its principal; 

(4) 
       
     whether the Block Defendants received kickbacks from RAL
lending institutions in violation of their fiduciary duties to Plaintiff and the
Class; 

(5) 
       
     whether the acts and practices of the Defendants were
done willfully, maliciously, fraudulently and/or with actual malice; and 

(6) 
       
     whether the Plaintiff and the Class have been damaged, injured
or have suffered irreparable harm and, if so, the extent of such damages or injuries
and/or the nature of the equitable and/or injunctive relief and statutory
damages to which each member of the Class is entitled. 

The Court finds that these central issues satisfy the commonality requirement as there are
questions of law and fact common to the proposed class.

3.    Typicality  

The third prong of Rule 2-231 (a) requires the representative Plaintiff to present
claims that are typical of the proposed class. The class representative must show that his/her
claims   arise from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims
of the other class members, and that the claims are based upon the same legal theory.    Twyman
v. 

6

Rockville
Housing Authority , 99 F.R.D. 314, 321 (D. Md. 1983). However, it is to be
understood that the typicality requirement does not mandate that the claims of the named
representative be  identical to  those of the other class members. This requirement is met even
though varying fact patterns support the claims or defenses of individual class members or there is
a disparity in the damages claimed by the named parties and the other members of the class.
 National Constructors Ass n v. National Electrical Contractors
Ass n , 498 F. Supp 510, 545
(D. Md. 1980) mod., 678 F. 2d 492 (4th Cir. 1982),  cert .  dismissed , 463 U.S. 1234 (1983). Typicality
can also be achieved by demonstrating that the Plaintiff can  show that the issues of law or fact
he or she share in common with the class occupy the same degree of centrality to his or her claims
as to those of unnamed members.   See   Weiss v. New York
Hospital , 745 F. 2d 786, 809 n. 36
(3rd Cir. 1984),  cert .  denied  470 U.S. 1060 (1985)
 citing   Donaldson v. Pillsbury , 554 F. 2d
825 (8th Cir.),  cert .  denied , 434 U.S. 856 (1977).

In the present case, the Plaintiff alleges that she and other members of the class were
subjected to a pattern and practice of the Defendants  misrepresenting the nature of the Rapid
Refund Program to consumers and that Defendants took advantage of the Plaintiff and members of the
proposed class by charging exorbitant interest rates on what was a fully secured, short term, loan
for the purpose of generating substantial undisclosed fees and profit. Plaintiff also alleges that
Block acted as an agent and the Court of Appeals has made the finding that Plaintiff has alleged
sufficient facts supporting the existence of an agency relationship.  Green v. H R Block, et
al.,  355 Md. 488,735 A.2d 1039 (1999) at 527. Thus, assuming an agency relationship, Defendant
Block owes a fiduciary duty to the Plaintiff and the proposed class.

The
Defendants argue that the Plaintiff s claims lack the necessary typicality to
warrant

7

her being accepted as a viable class representative. The Defendants cite the fact that the
Plaintiff did not read her applications before signing them, she did not cash a RAL check at Sears,
she requested a RAL in at least one year, and other such fine points (Defendant s Memorandum of Law
in Opposition to Plaintiff s Motion for Class Certification
pp.27 28). In making such an argument
about the minute specificities of Plaintiff s conduct as related to the conduct of the proposed
class, the Defendants essentially ignore the fact that the claims are not required to be identical.
The central issue of the class certification motion is one that deals with omitted information by a
fiduciary (agent) saddled with the obligation of revealing all pertinent information to its
principal. In this situation the Court cannot now ask the proposed class if they take issue with
the fact that information was knowingly omitted from their purview. The proper question is;  Was
information intentionally omitted from the knowledge of the Plaintiff and is this typical of the
proposed class as a whole? 

Class members usually are given the opportunity to opt out of the class by a particular
date, should they choose, if they take no offense to the actions of the Defendants or simply do not
want to be a part of the class. Rule 2 231 (e). The Court s focus is on the actions taken by the
Defendants at the time the harm occurred, not whether or not the proposed class takes objection to
such actions. The Court finds that the typicality requirement has been met.

4.    Adequacy of Representation  

The fourth factor to be considered under Maryland Rule 2-231 (a), is whether the
representative party will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.

Case law notes that there are two components to be considered within this prong 1) the
interests of the Plaintiff must coincide with the other members of the class; and 2) it must appear

8

that the Plaintiff and selected counsel will vigorously prosecute the action.  Disabled in
Action of Baltimore v. Bridwell , 593 F.Supp. 1241, 1245 (D.Md. 1984).

The first component, as borne out by the discussion on  Typicality,  is clearly met. This
Plaintiff s interests are in sync with other members of the class she seeks to represent in the
action. There are no antagonistic interests. The Defendant s claims that she is not an adequate
representative because she is not one of those customers who cashed her check at Sears or signed an
RAL containing an arbitration clause does not equate to her having antagonistic interests, merely
different and perhaps less damages as a result of any injury.

As to the second component of this prong, it is uncontradicted through pleadings and argument
that the plaintiff in this case reviewed the Complaint, discussed it with her attorneys, has had
other discussions with her attorneys, and appeared for deposition. Her testimony at deposition
demonstrates that she understands the nature of the Complaint, and the reasons she is suing H   R
Block, Inc., etal. In addition, while it is contested whether or not it meets Maryland s law, the
Plaintiff was able on deposition to give details of her fee arrangement with her attorneys. In
addition, the Plaintiff presented a letter from counsel explaining the nature of her fee
arrangement with them for the purposes of this case. The defendants point out that the copy
presented to them and the Court is unsigned by either the counsel, or the plaintiff, and that a
thorough discussion of what expenses are paid by the counsel, or what might be expected to be paid
by the plaintiff, and any percentage arrangements, as sometimes you might find in contingency
cases, is missing. Plaintiff, however, argues that in class action suits, it is not necessary to
have such details in writing. Plaintiff s deposition at pages
45   46 clearly indicates that her
understanding of the fee agreement matches the letter when she states:  The agreement

9

is that whatever the judge sees fit would be their payment, if there was any; if there
wasn t, then there wouldn t be any fee.  Ms. Green also conveyed she is under no obligation to pay
expenses whether she wins or loses. Also uncontradicted is that the plaintiff at deposition stated
that she was representing all Rapid Refund customers in the United States as opposed to all RAL
recipients in the State of Maryland as she pled in her Amended Complaint.

The Court finds that while the letter is scant, it does lay out the bare minimum requirements
for a fee arrangement; and that coupled with the testimony from the plaintiff indicating her
knowledge of the fee arrangement is sufficient to determine that she has, in fact, hired counsel,
and knows the fee arrangement, In addition, the plaintiff does appear to be a knowledgeable client,
understanding the gravamen of the case before her, and has followed through with filings,
pleadings, court appearances, and a deposition. The Court finds the misstatement in her deposition
with respect to how many persons she is seeking to represent in the class to be of little
consequence in the overall view of her knowledge of the case. The Plaintiff, in fact, has taken her
Complaint all the way to the Court of Appeals of Maryland after it was dismissed below and won a
reversal and remand; and has remained as the moving party as the case goes forward once again in
this Court. Her actions certainly suggest she is a knowledgeable, willing proponent of the cause,
and will be an adequate representative for the class.

With respect to the counsel she has retained, records reflect that they are well-known
attorneys in this field, and have filed numerous suits of this nature. The resumes of counsel, both
local and outside, reveal superior qualifications by noting vast experience in this type of
litigation, prior certifications won, including the one in the  Albertini  case before this
Court.

10

There is no question that they are knowledgeable and capable of pursuing this lawsuit, and have
thus far actively pursued Ms. Green s cause. There is no reason to doubt that they would not
continue to provide more than adequate representation for the class.

In sum, the Court believes that the plaintiff has met her burden and will be an adequate
representative for the class.

B. Requirements Under Maryland Rule 2-231 (b)

The Plaintiff, as an additional prerequisite to class certification, under Maryland Rule
2-231, must establish one of several factors under 231 (b)(3). The Plaintiff in this case has
chosen to rely upon the predominant and superiority clauses of that Rule.

1.  Predominance 

In determining whether the predominance standard is met, courts focus on the issue of
liability, and if the liability issue is common to the class, common questions are held to
predominate over individual ones.   Albertini v. Peat, Marwick, Main   Co.  Case No.
9008703/CL111170, (Cir. Ct. Balt. City, Md., July 10, 1992);  In Re Kirschner Medical Corp.
 Securities Litigation. 139 F.R.D. 74, 80, (D. Md. 1991). It is clear that several questions
exist which align themselves perfectly with the issue of liability: whether or not Defendants  acts activities and omissions amounted to violations of Maryland s Consumer Protection Act (the
Consumer Protection Act), fraudulent concealment and breaches of Defendants  fiduciary duties and
obligations; whether or not Plaintiff and the Class members were damaged by the violation of the
Consumer Protection Act; whether or not Defendants must disgorge the secret profit they realized in
breach of their duties; and whether or not declaratory relief is mandated are central questions.
However, the overall issue of this motion is whether the Defendants, while wearing

11

the hat of fiduciary (agent), intentionally omitted facts that the proposed class
(principal) had a right to be privy to. The Court of Appeals also narrowed the issue down to this
particular point:

r ather Green s central allegation relates to H R Block s failure to disclose the  true
nature  of its RAL program, in particular, the various ways it stands to benefit from the
customer s agreement with the lending bank. The Court finds that the issue of liability is
common to the class.  Green , at 526.

Defendants argue that the fraudulent omissions and negligent misrepresentations require proof
of individual reliance and thus, certification under (b) (3) is inappropriate because individual
issues of reliance will predominate over any common question of law and fact.

The court stated in  Kirschner,    i n the event that individual issues of reliance pose
difficulties as to case management at a later stage, there are mechanisms available to effectively
litigate the reliance questions, without destroying the efficiency of class proceedings on other
issues.   Kirschner  at 83. Also, as stated in  Albertini,  there are several other avenues
available to resolve reliance issues without sacrificing class certification (mini-hearings and
questionnaires to name a few).

Furthermore, there is case law, as Plaintiff argues (in Plaintiffs Reply Brief in Support of
Her Motion for Class Certification), that supports the idea that common misrepresentations obviates
the need to gather individual testimony as to each element of a fraud or misrepresentation claim,
especially where written misrepresentations or omissions are involved.  Cope v. Metropolitan
Life Insurance Company , 82 Ohio St. 3d 426, at 430, (1998) citing  Shields v. Lefta,
Inc. , 888 F. Supp. 891, 893 (N.D. 111. 1995). This would seem to include individual issues of
reliance. Therefore, the Court finds that common issues predominate over any questions affecting
only individual members.

12

2.  Superiority 

The second prong of plaintiff s reliability under Maryland Rule 231(b)(3) requires that
a class action be superior to other methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the case.

The plaintiff first notes that the defendant should be estopped from objecting to the class
action because it has entertained a class action in the State of Illinois in  Zawickowski, et al
v. Beneficial National Bank, et al , No. 98 (2178, N.Dist, 111., E.Dist). Defendant
distinguishes that action as a settlement only class which is allowed under  Amchem Products,
Inc. v. Windsor , 521 U.S. 591, 117 S Ct. 2231 (1997), and denotes different factors are
considered for a settlement class certification, rather than a class certification for trial. The
Courts have noted that the requirements for certification settlement purposes are less stringent
 to encourage sweeping settlements of complex litigation,   Bowling v. Pfizer , 143 F.R.D.
141, 158 (S.D. Ohio 1992). The Court agrees with Defendant and, therefore, will not find that they
have waived their right of objection to the class on this basis.

As plaintiff notes, obviously, the cost of trying this claim in separate cases would be
extremely expensive to the individual customers who felt they were wronged. Evidence presented
shows that the loss to each alleged injured party would be nominal, such as five to fifteen dollars
per RAL. Faced with those types of damages, it is unlikely that one person would undertake the
expense involved in this complex litigation. And in fact, case law notes that when the amount of
money each person loses is small, then that is when class actions are most appropriate.  Sewell
v. Sprint PCS, L.P. , supra.

In addition, class actions have the least burdensome effect on the judicial system, as
they facilitate judicial economy and efficiency, as well as consistent judgments. A class action is

13

preferable, in that it would provide a speedier and more comprehensive determination of the
allegations at issue. It would also prevent inconsistent verdicts being entered against the
defendants, and would spare the defendants, and the Court, repetitive piecemeal litigation.

While the defendant raises claims of mini trials being necessary to resolve issues of causation and
reliance, the common questions of law and fact noted above would indicate that those issues would
really go more towards damages, as opposed to the merit of the lawsuit. It is alleged that the
failure to disclose the fee arrangement between H   R Block, Inc., and its lenders, the fact that
the monies the clients received were actually loans, and not their refunds, and that Block received
incentive, or  kickbacks  from the lending institutions, and from Sears where a lot of the checks
were cashed, would be the same for all the members of the class. The specific details of each of
their visits to the H   R Block for tax preparations, or their specific disclosure forms, would not
be relevant. The defendant relies heavily on the issue that the Court must know whether each class
member would have obtained a RAL had they known that Block were receiving a percentage of the fee,
or receiving a kickback, or receiving any part of the proceeds from the cashing of the check. They
also allege that the Court cannot assume that every member of the class was lured by the same Block
ad; however, evidence shows that the ads were all similar, especially with regards to the key
information that would make a person want to apply for the Rapid Refund RAL.

In sum, the Court finds that the members of the class are clearly identifiable and have similar
claims, and that the benefits of judicial economy, consistent judgments, as well as the saving of
trial costs for punitive class members, clearly make class action a superior remedy then individual
lawsuits.

14

C.  CONCLUSION 

For the reasons stated above, the Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied the
requirements of Rule 2-231 (a) and (b)(3), and will certify the class defined by Plaintiff.
Pursuant to Rule 2-23 l(c), this determination may be altered or amended at anytime before a
decision on the merits upon further review of the Court. Additionally, the Court shall invite from
the parties a proposed order for the form of notice to be given members of the class.

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:

1. For purposes of this settlement only, the Court has jurisdiction over
the subject matter of the Action and personal jurisdiction over the parties and the
members of the Settlement Classes described below.

2. Pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) of the West Virginia Rules of Civil
Procedure, the Court confirms its prior certification of the following Settlement
Classes for purposes of settlement only:

(a)  State Law Class : All residents of the several jurisdictions identified in the
chart attached as Exhibit A who applied for and obtained a RAL through any medium, by any name,
advertised, marketed, offered or made by or through any lender through any office operating under
the trade name of  H R Block  (including franchise or sub-franchise offices of any Settling

through December 23, 2005, and did not timely request exclusion from this class;

3

(b)  West Virginia Class : All West Virginia residents who applied for

from January 1, 1994 through December 23, 2005, who did not previously request
exclusion from the  Cummins  class or timely request exclusion from this class, other
than those persons who previously requested exclusion from the  Cummins  class,
subsequently obtained a RAL through any Settling Defendant or Affiliate in 2005,
and did not timely request exclusion from this class with respect to such 2005 RAL.

(c)  Becker Class : All Ohio residents who applied for and obtained a
RAL through any medium, by any name, advertised, marketed, offered or made by
or through any lender through any office operating under the trade name of  H R
Block  (including franchise or sub-franchise offices of any HRB Defendant or
Affiliate, as defined herein, or any H R Block offices such as in Sears stores) from
January 1, 2000 through December 23, 2005, and did not timely request exclusion
from this class.

(d)  Mitchell/Green Class : All Maryland residents who applied for and
obtained a RAL at any H R Block office in Maryland from January 1, 1992 through
December 31, 1996 and did not thereafter apply for and obtain a RAL subject to an

through December 31, 1996 through any  H R Block  office in Alabama for which

4

the Settling Defendants herein received a license fee payment or portion of the finance charge, and
who did not previously request exclusion from their respective classes that were previously
certified or timely request exclusion from this class.

3. The Court confirms the appointments
of the class representatives and class counsel with respect to each Settlement Class, as follows:

(a)  State Law Class : Justin Sevey, Maryanne Hoekman and Renea
Griffith are appointed class representatives; and Daniel Hume, Esq., of Kirby
Mclnerney   Squire, LLP, Ronald L. Futterman, Esq., Michael I. Behn, Esq., and
William W. Thomas, Esq., of Futterman   Howard, Chtd, Michael B. Hyman, Esq.,

Rubenstein, P.C., and Scott S. Segal, Esq. of The Segal Law Firm are appointed as
class counsel to the State Law Class.

(b) West Virginia Class: Deadra Cummins, Ivan Bell and LaDonna Bell
are appointed class representative and Brian A. Glasser, Esq., H. F. Salsbery, Esq.,

Coordinating Counsel.

(c)  Becker Class : Lynn Becker is appointed class representative and
John Roddy, Esq., Gary Klein, Esq., and Elizabeth Ryan, Esq., of Roddy Klein  
Ryan, Ronald Frederick, Esq. of Ronald Frederick   Associates, LLC, and Bruce L.
Freeman, Esq., Freeman   Chiartas, are appointed class counsel to the Becker
Class.

5

(d)  Mitchell/Green Class : Levon and Geral Mitchell and Joyce A. Green are appointed
class representatives Steven A. Martino, Esq., Frederick T. Kuykendall III, Esq., and W. Lloyd
Copeland, Esq. of Taylor, Martino   Kuykendall, Steven E. Angstreich, Esq., Michael Coren, Esq.,
Carolyn C. Lindheim, Esq., of Levy, Angstreich, Finney, Baldante, Rubenstein and Coren, P.C.,
Charles J. Piven, Esq., of Law Offices of Charles J. Piven, PA, and Marvin W. Masters, Esq., of The
Masters Law Firm lc, are appointed class counsel to the Mitchell/Green Class.

4. With respect to each of the respective Settlement Classes, this Court confirms its
previous preliminary findings in the Preliminary Approval Order that, for settlement purposes
only, (a) the Settlement Class as defined above is so numerous that joinder of all members is
impracticable; (b) there are questions of law or fact common to the Settlement Class; (c) the
claims of the respective class representatives (the  Class Representatives ), identified in
paragraph 3 above, are typical of the claims of their respective class; (d) the Class
Representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Settlement Class; (e) the
questions of law or fact common to the members of the Settlement Class predominate over the
questions affecting only individual members, and (f) certification of the Settlement Class is
superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. In
the event the Settlement Agreement terminates pursuant to its terms or the certification of any
Settlement Class does not become final for any reason, the conditional certification of such
Settlement Class pursuant to this Order shall be vacated automatically and shall be null and void,
and any such Settlement

6

Class shall revert to its status immediately prior to the execution of the Settlement Agreement.

5. The Court finds that the Notice was given to members of the
Settlement Class in accordance with the Preliminary Approval Order and such
Notice by first-class mail and publication adequately informed members of the
Settlement Classes of all material elements of the proposed settlement, constituted
valid, due, and sufficient notice to all members of the Settlement Classes,
constituted the best notice practicable under the circumstances, and fully satisfied
all requirements of Rule 23(c) of the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure and
applicable law.

6. The persons who made timely and valid requests for exclusion are
excluded from the Settlement Classes and are not bound by this Order of Final
Judgment and Dismissal. The identities of such persons are set forth in Exhibit
B attached hereto.

7. The Settlement Agreement was arrived at as a result of arms -length
negotiations conducted in good faith by counsel for the Parties, with the assistance
of an experienced mediator, and is supported by the Representatives of the
Settlement Classes.

8. The Action presents issues as to liability and damages as to which
there are substantial grounds for differences of opinion.

9. The Court finally approves the settlement of the Action in
accordance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement and finds that the

7

settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate in all respects in light of the complexity, expense
and duration of litigation and the risks involved in establishing liability, damages and in
maintaining the class action through trial and appeal.

10. Payment
of cash as provided under the Settlement Agreement
constitutes fair value given in exchange for the release of the Released Claims
against the Released Parties. The Court finds that the consideration to be paid
to Settlement Class Members is well within the range of reasonableness
considering the facts and circumstances of the RAL transactions at issue, the
numerous types of claims and affirmative defenses asserted in the Action and
other RAL litigation over many years, and the potential risks and likelihood of
success of alternatively pursuing trial on the merits.

11. The Court orders the parties to the Settlement Agreement to
perform their obligations thereunder pursuant to the terms of the Settlement
Agreement.

12. The Court dismisses this Action, and the Released Claims, with
prejudice and without costs (except as otherwise provided herein and in the
Settlement Agreement) against Plaintiffs and all Settlement Class Members, and
adjudges that the Released Claims and all of the claims described in the Settlement
Agreement, Section I, Paragraphs 2 through 5 are released against the Released
Parties.

13. The Court adjudges that the Class Representatives and all

8

Settlement Class Members who receive money from the Settlement Fund under the Settlement
Agreement shall be deemed to have, fully, finally and forever released, relinquished and discharged
all Released Claims against the Released Parties, as defined by the Settlement Agreement. The Court
further adjudges that each Settlement Class Member who did not timely and validly request exclusion
from this settlement (the  Non-Opt Outs ), but for whatever reason did not submit a claim to
receive money from the Settlement Fund, shall be deemed to have fully, finally and forever released
and extinguished his or her right (if any ever existed) to adjudicate a Released Claim in any forum
other than by individual arbitration as permitted by and in accordance with the arbitration
provision of the 2005 RAL application, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit C to the Motion. In
all other respects, such Non-Opt Outs do not release any Released Claims for a period of one year
after the Effective Date, as defined in the Settlement Agreement, Section II, Paragraph 6, at which
time such Non-Opt Outs shall be deemed to have, fully, finally and forever released, relinquished
and discharged all Released Claims against the Released Parties.

14. The Court further adjudges that upon the Effective Date, each of the Released Parties and
all signatories to the Settlement Agreement shall be deemed to have fully, finally and forever
released, relinquished and discharged Plaintiffs, Class Counsel, and the Settling Defendants and
their counsel in this Action from any claims (including Unknown Claims) for abuse of process,
libel, malicious prosecution or similar claims arising out of, relating to, or in connection with
the

9

institution, prosecution, defense, assertion, or resolution of the Action, including any right
under any statute or federal law to seek counsel fees and costs.

15. Plaintiffs and Settlement Class Members are permanently barred and
enjoined from asserting, commencing, prosecuting or continuing any of the
Released Claims or any of the claims described in the Settlement Agreement,
Section I, Paragraphs 2 through 5 against the Released Parties, except in a manner
consistent with paragraph 13,  supra , to the extent applicable.

16. It is in the best interests of the Parties and the Settlement Class
Members and consistent with principles of judicial economy that any dispute
between any Settlement Class member (including any dispute as to whether any
person is a Settlement Class Member) and any Released Party which in any way
relates to the applicability or scope of the Settlement Agreement or this Final Order
of Judgment and Dismissal should be presented exclusively to this Court for
resolution by this Court. Therefore, without affecting the finality of this Final Order
of Judgment and Dismissal in any way, the Court retains jurisdiction over: (a)
implementation and enforcement of the Settlement Agreement until the final
judgment contemplated hereby has become effective and each and every act
agreed to be performed by the parties hereto shall have been performed pursuant
to the Settlement Agreement; (b) any other action necessary to conclude this
settlement and to administer, effectuate, interpret and monitor compliance with the
provisions of the Settlement Agreement.

17. The Court approves of Class Counsel attorneys  fees, costs and

10

expenses for the  Cummins  class in the amount of                       , and
for the State Law class, the  Becker  class,
and the  Mitchell/Green  class in the total amount of                       . These amounts shall be paid from the
Settlement Fund to Coordinating Counsel in accordance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement.
Coordinating Counsel will then distribute the money among class counsel in his discretion.

18. The Court approves the service fee payment of
$                       for Class Representative Deadra
Cummins. This amount shall be paid from the Settlement Fund in accordance with the terms of
the Settlement Agreement.

19. The Court approves the service fee payment of
$                       for Class Representatives Ivan and
LaDonna Bell. This amount shall be paid from the Settlement Fund in accordance with the
terms of the Settlement Agreement.

20. The Court approves the service fee payment of
$                       for Class Representative Joyce Green.
This amount shall be paid from the Settlement Fund in accordance with the terms of the
Settlement Agreement.

21. The Court approves the service fee payment of
$                       for Class Representatives Levon and
Geral Mitchell. This amount shall be paid from the Settlement Fund in accordance with the
terms of the Settlement Agreement.

22. The Court approves the service fee payment of
$                       for Class Representative Lynn Becker.
This amount shall be paid from the Settlement Fund in accordance with the terms of the
Settlement Agreement.

23. The Court approves the service fee payment of
$                       for Class

11

Representative Renea Griffith. This amount shall be paid from the Settlement Fund in
accordance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement.

24. The Court approves the service fee payment of
$                       for Class Representative Maryanne
Hoekman. This amount shall be paid from the Settlement Fund in accordance with the terms of
the Settlement Agreement.

25. The Court approves the service fee payment of
$                       for Class Representative Justin Sevey.
This amount shall be paid from the Settlement Fund in accordance with the terms of the
Settlement Agreement.

26. Neither this Final Order of Judgment and Dismissal nor the Settlement Agreement is an
admission or concession by any of the Settling
Defendants or their Affiliates of any fault, omission, liability, or wrongdoing. This
Final Order of Judgment and Dismissal shall not constitute a finding of either fact
or law as to the merits or the validity or invalidity of any claims in this Action or a
determination of any wrongdoing by the Settling Defendants, or a finding as to
any obligation of the Settling Defendants or their Affiliates to take any actions
agreed to be done or avoided as necessary in order to bring them into
compliance with law. The final approval of the Settlement Agreement does not
constitute any opinion, position, or determination of this Court, one way or the
other, as to the merits of the claims and defenses of the Settling Defendants or
the Settlement Class members.

27. All objections to the Settlement Agreement are overruled and denied
in all respects. The Court finds that no just reason exists for delay in entering this

12

Final Order of Judgment and Dismissal. Accordingly, the Clerk is hereby directed forthwith to
enter this Final Order of Judgment and Dismissal.

PROPOSED  ORDER PRELIMINARILY APPROVING CLASS ACTION 
SETTLEMENT AND PROVIDING FOR NOTICE 
( PRELIMINARY APPROVAL ORDER )

WHEREAS, the Court has been advised that the parties to this action, Plaintiffs Deadra D.
Cummins, and Ivan and LaDonna Bell, and Defendants H R Block, Inc., et al., along with the parties
in three related actions,  Mitchell v. H R Block, Inc. et

collectively referred to as the Settling Actions) have agreed, subject to Court approval
following notice to the Settlement Class and a hearing, to settle these actions upon the
terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement of Settlement ( Agreement ), which has been
filed with the Court as an attachment to the Motion for Preliminary Approval;

WHEREAS, the Plaintiffs having made application, pursuant to West Virginia Rule
of Civil Procedure 23, for an order preliminarily approving the settlement of the Action in
accordance with the Agreement of Settlement and the Exhibits annexed thereto, which set
forth the terms and conditions for a proposed settlement of this action and the Settling
Cases and for dismissal of the this action and the Settling Cases with prejudice upon the
terms and conditions set forth therein; and

WHEREAS, the Plaintiffs have moved for leave to file a Consolidated and Amended
Complaint, consolidating this action and the Settling Actions for purposes of settlement,
and the plaintiffs have lodged with the Court a Consolidated and Amended Complaint; and

WHEREAS, all defined terms contained herein shall have the same meanings as set forth
in the Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the Court having read and considered the Agreement, and

2

based upon the Agreement and all of the files, records, and proceedings herein, and it
appearing to the Court that upon preliminary examination the Agreement and settlement appears
fair, reasonable and adequate, and that a hearing should and will be held after notice to the
proposed Settlement Classes to confirm that the Agreement and settlement are fair, reasonable, and
adequate, and to determine whether a Final Order of Judgment and Dismissal should be
entered in this action based upon the Agreement;

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:

1. For purposes of settlement only, the Court has jurisdiction over the
subject matter of the Settling Actions and personal jurisdiction over the parties
and the members of the proposed Settlement Classes described below.

2. For purposes of settlement only, the Court allows the motion to consolidate this
action and the Settling Actions (hereinafter collectively referred to as the  Action ), and
accepts the Consolidated and Amended Complaint as filed. In the event that one or more of the
Settlement Classes as provided in the Agreement is not approved by the Court, such
Consolidated and Amended Complaint will be stricken and this order vacated automatically, as far
as they relate to any such disapproved Settlement Class, (i) concurrently with any order rejecting
approval of this Agreement or disapproving any such Settlement Class or, (ii) in the event that
the Court grants final approval of one or more Settlement Classes as provided in the Agreement but
such final approval order is subsequently reversed or modified on appeal, concurrently with any
order remanding the Action to this Court, in either

3

case without the need for any further order of this Court, and in either such instance any
Settlement Class that is not approved by the Court or for which certification is reversed or
modified on appeal will revert to its status immediately prior to the execution of the Agreement.

3. The Agreement and the settlement contained therein are preliminarily approved as fair,
reasonable, and adequate.

4. Pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) of the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court
certifies the following Settlement Classes for purposes of settlement only:

(a)  State Law Class:  All residents of the several jurisdictions identified in the

offices such as in Sears

4

stores) from January 1, 1994 through December 23, 2005 who have not previously requested exclusion
from the  Cummins  class; provided, however, that persons who opted-out of the certified  Cummins 
litigation class and who obtained a RAL through any Settling Defendant or Affiliate in 2005, will
receive another opt-out opportunity for their 2005 RALs only.

(c)  Becker Class:  All Ohio residents who applied for and obtained a RAL through any
medium, by any name, advertised, marketed, offered or made by or through any lender through any
office operating under the trade name of  H R Block  (including franchise or sub-franchise offices

Sears stores) from January 1, 2000 through December 23, 2005.

any H R Block office in Maryland from January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1996 and did not

class.

5. The Court makes the following appointments with respect to each Settlement Class, for

5

over the questions affecting only individual members, and (e) certification of the Settlement Class
is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.
In the event the Agreement terminates pursuant to its terms for any reason, the conditional
certification of the Settlement Classes pursuant to this Order shall be vacated automatically and
shall be null and void, and this action shall revert to its status immediately prior to the

-1-

1. Why Did I Get This Notice? 

You got at least one Refund Anticipation Loan ( RAL ) through an H R Block office between
January 1, 1994 and December 23, 2005. You received this notice to inform you about
settlement of a class action lawsuit that may affect your rights. This notice provides
information about all of your options, so that you can evaluate those options before the
Court decides whether to approve the settlement. Those options include making a claim for
money from the settlement (see Questions 7-9), excluding yourself from the settlement
(Questions 11   12) or raising concerns about the fairness of the settlement (Question 16).
This package explains the lawsuit, the settlement, your legal rights, what benefits are
available, who is eligible for them, and how to get them. The Court in charge of the case is
the Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia ( the Court ).

2. What Is This Lawsuit About? 

This case combines several lawsuits that were filed against H R Block, Inc. and various
related corporations. For simplicity, the H  R Block defendants are referred to throughout
the rest of this notice as simply  Block.  The cases were filed against Block in different
parts of the country at different times, but all essentially make the same claim   that
Block violated particular state laws in the way it made RALs available. The lawyers in these
cases have filed with the Court an Amended and Consolidated Class Action Complaint (called
the  Consolidated Action  from here on), which brings together all of the claims made in
these cases. One of the principal claims the Consolidated Action makes is that Block
violated the Credit Services Organization Acts of the affected jurisdictions, or violated
similar laws.

Block denies that it violated any laws, did anything wrong, or that anyone was harmed by its
conduct. Block nevertheless has agreed to settle the Consolidated Action solely to avoid the
burden, expense, risk and uncertainty of continuing the various lawsuits.

Block and the plaintiffs in the Consolidated Actions have reached agreement on a Settlement
of the claims in the Consolidated Action including claims that had been pending previously
in Ohio, Maryland, and Alabama. The Settlement, if approved, would resolve all litigation
involving RALs which Block sold in West Virginia between January 1, 1994 and December 23,
2005. Other cases are also being settled at the same time, in the same settlement agreement,
covering legal rights of individuals in a number of other jurisdictions.

3. Why Is This A Class Action? 

In a class action, one or more people called Class Representatives (in this case Deadra D. Cummins,
Ivan Bell and LaDonna Bell), sue on behalf of people who have similar claims. All these people are
a Class or Class Members. One court resolves the issues for all Class Members, except for those who
exclude themselves from the Class. Circuit Court Judge Louis Bloom is in charge of this class
action.

4. Why Is There A Settlement? 

The Court did not decide in favor of Block or any of the Plaintiffs in the various lawsuits. The
Plaintiffs in those lawsuits think they could have won if they went to trial. Block thinks the
Plaintiffs would have lost. In fact, in most cases, Block thinks that the Plaintiffs would not have
even been able to continue their cases in court, because Block s RAL contract required them to try
their claims before an arbitrator. But there was no trial and no arbitration. Instead, both sides
agreed to a settlement. This avoids the cost of a trial, and the people affected have an
opportunity to be paid. The Class Representatives and the attorneys think the settlement is best
for all Class Members.

5. How Do I Know If I Am Part Of The Settlement? 

You received this notice because records identified you as a  Cummins  class member. That means that
you fit the description of the class which the Court certified for this settlement. The Court
decided that everyone who fits this description is a Class Member:

All West Virginia residents who applied for and obtained a RAL through any medium, by any name,
advertised, marketed, offered or made by or through any lender through any office operating under
the trade name of  H R Block  (including franchise or sub-franchise offices of any Settling
Defendant or Affiliate, or any H R Block offices such as in Sears stores) from January 1, 1994
through December 23, 2005, who did not previously request exclusion from the  Cummins  class, other
than those persons who previously requested exclusion from the  Cummins  class, subsequently obtained
a RAL through any Settling Defendant or Affiliate in 2005.

There are three other classes that are part of the overall Settlement. The following classes are
composed of people who live in one of the following jurisdictions and got a RAL through an H R
Block office during the specified years:

a.) The Becker Class (Ohio residents)   January 1, 2000 to December 23, 2005;

b.)
The  Mitchell/Green  Class (residents of Maryland and Alabama)
  Maryland   January 1, 1992 to May
19, 2000, excluding those people who obtained RALs

after 1996 whose RAL application contains an arbitration clause; Alabama   June 13, 1989 through
December 31, 1996;

c.)
The  State Law  Class (residents of 22 states and the District
of Columbia)   January 1, 2000
through December 23, 2005: Arkansas, Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois,
Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire,
Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington or Wisconsin.

6. What Does The Settlement Provide? 

Block has agreed to provide additional information to customers who obtain RALs and to pay a total
of $62.5 million, plus costs of notice estimated at $4 million, to settle this case. The total
Block will pay is called the  common fund. 

You are a member of the  Cummins  class.  Cummins  class members are entitled to $32.5 million of the
$62.5 million, before deductions for the pro rata portion of administration costs, attorney s fees
and expenses relating to the  Cummins  Class, and service fees paid to the class representatives,
Deadra D. Cummins, Ivan Bell and LaDonna Bell. The State Law class will divide more than $22.5
million; the  Becker  class will divide more than $5.8 million; and the  Mitchell/Green  (Maryland and
Alabama) class will divide over $1.6 million; all before the same deductions are made for
administration costs, attorney s fees and expenses, and service fees applicable to each class.

Members of the different classes who submit claims will receive different amounts because each of
these cases is at a different stage of proceedings, holds different risks and different chances of
success. Each class settlement was negotiated based upon these differences. The four classes are
represented independently.

7. How Much Will My Payments Be? 

In order to receive any payment, you must return a claim form (see Question 8 and the attached
claim form). Every Class Member who returns a valid claim form will receive at least some
distribution from the common fund. Your share of the fund will depend on the number of valid claim
forms that  Cummins  Class Members send in and how many RALs you had. If every class member submitted
a claim, your share of the common fund would be a minimum of $60.90 for each RAL you obtained
during the class period. However, only a percentage of class members will actually submit claim
forms. For example, if one of every two class members return claim forms, your share of the fund
would be $121.80 for each RAL you obtained ($60.90 times two). Please remember that this is only an
example; the amount you receive from the settlement could be greater or smaller. Your share will be
reduced by whatever percentage of the common fund is taken up with administration costs, attorney s
fees, expenses, and service payments. It is unlikely that such costs will exceed 35%, but they

could be higher or lower. The maximum amount any class member can receive is $175 for each RAL
obtained during the class period.

8. How Can I Get A Payment? 

To qualify for payment, you must send in a complete and valid claim form.  A claim form is attached
to this Notice.  You may also get a claim form from the Settlement Administrator s website
  www.INSERTWEBADDRESS.com  . Read the instructions carefully, fill out the form, include all the
information the form asks for, sign it, and mail it so that it is postmarked no later than  June 30,
2006.  You may also email the claim form to the Settlement Administrator at  claims@INSERTWEBADDRESS.com . If you email the claim form, you must do so no later than midnight on  June
30, 2006. 

9. When Would I Get My Payment? 

The Court will hold a hearing at  time/date/month/2006 at the Kanawha County Judicial Annex, 111
Court Street, Charleston, West Virginia 25301,  to decide whether to approve the settlement. If the
Court approves the settlement after that, there may be appeals. It s always uncertain whether these
appeals can be resolved, and resolving them can take time, perhaps more than a year. The settlement
administrator will keep the settlement website at  www.INSERTWEBADDRESS.com  updated so that
everyone who is in the class may keep informed of the progress of the settlement. Please be
patient. Note: It is unlikely that you will receive your payment until six months or more after the
date you send in a claim form.

10. Am I Giving Up Anything To Get A Payment Or Stay In The Class? 

Unless you exclude yourself, also called  opting out  (see Question 12), you will be considered a
member of the class, which means that you can t sue, continue to sue, or be part of any other
lawsuit against Block about the legal issues in this case. Giving up your claims is called a
 release.  Unless you exclude yourself from the settlement, you will release your claims whether or
not you submit a claim form and receive payment.

However, certain claims are not released even if you stay in the class. All claims made in other
currently existing class actions that relate to the RAL or other products and services offered by
Block are not released. Claims under state law based solely on allegations that a tax preparer
failed (A) to properly prepare a tax return or (B) to maintain the confidentiality of taxpayer
information resulting in injury based on  stolen identity  or similar misuse of taxpayer
information or theft of a RAL check; and claims to enforce the terms and conditions of the
Settlement Agreement, are similarly not released.

Class members who do not exclude themselves, but do not make a claim for money from this settlement
may choose to arbitrate their individual claims

against Block for another year after the settlement is finalized. Although Class Counsel recommend
this settlement, they take no position on your likelihood of succeeding on an individual basis in
an arbitration case. You should obtain independent legal help if you need more information about
the economic value of the arbitration alternative to excluding yourself or making a claim for money
under the settlement.

The settlement requires Block to follow certain business practices with future RALs, and provides
Block with an incentive to register as a Credit Service Organization ( CSO ) in the jurisdictions
covered by the settlement. Block has two years to decide whether to register and come into
compliance with the various CSO statutes.

Important:   If  you decide to go back to Block to obtain a RAL during the two-year period Block has
to register as a CSO in the various jurisdictions,  and  Block does register and comply with your
jurisdiction s CSO statute in that two-year period, then  you will not be able to sue Block for any
new RAL violation that you claim happened during the two-year period.  But,  if Block does not
register  as a CSO  and comply  with the CSO statute in your jurisdiction, you will be able to sue
based on any new RAL violation that you claimed happened during that period. In addition, any
deadline on when you can sue Block (called the  statute of limitations ) will be suspended for the
two-year period.

11. Can I Exclude Myself From The Settlement (Sometimes Called
 Opting Out )? 

Yes, you may  opt out  and exclude yourself from the Settlement Class. If you opt out, you will not
receive any payment from the common fund, you will not release any claims you may have against
Block, and you will not be bound by anything that happens in the Consolidated Action. If you opt
out, you will be free to pursue whatever legal rights you may have by pursuing your own lawsuit
against Block at your own risk and expense.

12. What Do I Do If I Want To Exclude Myself? 

In order to opt out and exclude yourself from the Settlement Class, you must mail a  Request for
Exclusion  to the Settlement Administrator at  address . Your Request for Exclusion must be in
writing and must be postmarked no later than May 1, 2006. To be effective, a Request for Exclusion
must contain: (a) the name of this case  (Cummins, v. H   R Block, Inc.);  (b) your name, address,
social security number and telephone number; (c) a statement that you want to opt out of the
lawsuit; and (d) your signature. If the Request for Exclusion is not postmarked by the deadline,
you will be included automatically in the Settlement Class and you may be eligible to receive
Settlement payments as summarized above. Even if you do not file a claim, you will be legally bound
by the proposed Settlement, including provisions releasing Block.

13. When And Where Will The Court Decide Whether To Approve The
Settlement? 

The Court will hold a Fairness Hearing on  time/date/ at the Kanawha County Judicial Annex, 111
Court Street, Charleston, West Virginia 25301.  At this
hearing the Court will consider whether the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. If there
are objections, the Court will consider them. The Court will listen to people who have asked to
speak at the hearing. The Court may also decide how much to pay to Class Counsel. After the
hearing, the Court will decide whether to approve the settlement. We do not know how long these
decisions will take. The hearing can be continued at any time by the Court without any further
notice to you.

14. Do I Have To Come To The Hearing? 

No. You are not required to attend the hearing. But you are welcome to come at your own expense. If
you wish to speak, you may ask the Court for permission to speak at the Fairness Hearing. To do so,
you must send a letter saying that it is your  Notice of Intention to Appear in  Cummins v. H R
Block.   Be sure to include your name, address, telephone number, and your signature. Your Notice of
Intention to Appear must be received no later than  May 1, 2006,  and be sent to the Clerk of the
Court, Class Counsel, and Defense Counsel, at the addresses in Question 16. You cannot speak at the
hearing if you excluded yourself, because once you exclude yourself, the settlement does not affect
your rights.

15. What If I Do Nothing? 

If you do nothing, you ll get no money from this settlement. But, unless you exclude yourself, you
won t be able to start a lawsuit, continue with a lawsuit, or be part of any other lawsuit against
Block about the legal issues in this case. You would, however, be able to arbitrate your claims
against Block for another year, as described in Question 10.

16. What If I Want To Object To The Settlement? 

If you re a Class Member who has not requested exclusion, you can object to the settlement if you
don t like it. If you wish to object, you must write a letter stating your objections, the specific
reasons for each objection (including any legal support you want to bring to the Court s attention)
and a description of any evidence you wish to introduce in support of your objections. You must
include your name, address, telephone number and your signature. Also include the name and number
of this action  (Cummins v. H R Block, Inc.,  Civil Action No. 03-C-134). Your letter must be
received in these four different places no later than  May 1, 2006: 

(i) Coordinating Counsel:

Brian A. Giasser, Esq.

Bailey   Glasser, LLP 
227 Capitol Street 
Charleston, WV 25301

(ii) Defendants  Counsel:

(iii) The Court:

Clerk of Court 
Kanawha County Circuit Court 
111 Court Street 
Charleston, WV 25301

17. What Is The Difference Between Excluding Myself And Objecting? 

Excluding yourself is telling the Court that you don t want to be part of the Class. If you
exclude yourself, you have no basis to object because the case no longer affects you. Objecting is
telling the Court that you don t like something about the settlement and you don t want the Court
to approve it. You can object only if you stay in the Class.

18. Who Are The Lawyers For The    Cummins    Class? 

The Court has appointed the following law firm to represent you and other  Cummins  Class Members.
These lawyers are called Class Counsel. If you want to be represented by your own lawyer, you may
hire one at your own expense.

Brian A. Glasser 
H. F. Salsbery 
John W. Barrett 
Eric B. Snyder 
Bailey   Glasser LLP 
227 Capitol Street 
Charleston,WV 25301

19. How Will Class Counsel s Fees And Expenses Be Paid? 

Class Counsel will make an application to the Court for approval of an award of attorneys  fees and
expenses in an amount not more than one-third of the portion of the common fund attributable to the
 Cummins  Class. The fees would pay Class Counsel for investigating the facts, litigating the case,
and negotiating

the settlement. The Court will determine the amount of any fees and expenses awarded to Class
Counsel.

20. Does The Class Representative Get Additional Compensation? 

Subject to Court approval, the named plaintiffs in the five cases which make up the Consolidated
Action will seek  service awards  for their active participation in this litigation. Any such
 service award  will be paid from the portions of the common fund attributable to the cases those
plaintiffs brought. The  Cummins  class representatives will seek a service award in an amount to be
determined by the Court.

21. What If The Court Does Not Approve The Settlement? 

If the Court does not approve the proposed Settlement as being fair, adequate and reasonable,
the Settlement Agreement will be null and void, and all parties will be returned to their
respective pre-Settlement status in the various lawsuits that the proposed Settlement hopes to
resolve.

22. Where Do I Get Additional Information? 

This notice summarizes the proposed settlement. You can find answers to common questions about the
settlement, plus other helpful information at the Settlement Administrator s website
 www.INSERTWEBADDRESS.com . You can also get a copy of the Settlement Agreement from the website,
or by writing to the Settlement Administrator at ####. If you cannot get the information you need
from this notice or from the Settlement Administrator, you may contact  Cummins  Class Counsel.

Please    Do     Not    Contact The Court Or Block For Information.

1. Why Did I Get This Notice? 

You got at least one Refund Anticipation Loan ( RAL ) through an H R Block office between
January 1, 2000 and December 23, 2005. You received this notice to inform you about
settlement of a class action lawsuit that may affect your rights. This notice provides
information about all of your options, so that you can evaluate those options before the
Court decides whether to approve the settlement. Those options include making a claim for
money from the settlement (see Questions 7-9), excluding yourself from the settlement
(Questions 11   12) or raising concerns about the fairness of the settlement (Question 16).
This package explains the lawsuit, the settlement, your legal rights, what benefits are
available, who is eligible for them, and how to get them. The Court in charge of the case is
the Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia ( the Court ).

2. What Is This Lawsuit About? 

This case combines several lawsuits that were filed against H R Block, Inc. and various
related corporations. For simplicity, the H  R Block defendants are referred to throughout
the rest of this notice as simply  Block.  The cases were filed against Block in different
parts of the country at different times, but all essentially make the same claim   that
Block violated particular state laws in the way it made RALs available. The lawyers in these
cases have filed with the Court an Amended and Consolidated Class Action Complaint (called
the  Consolidated Action  from here on), which brings together all of the claims made in
these cases. One of the principal claims the Consolidated Action makes is that Block
violated the Credit Services Organization Acts of the affected jurisdictions, or violated
similar laws.

Block denies that it violated any laws, did anything wrong, or that anyone was harmed by its
conduct. Block nevertheless has agreed to settle the Consolidated Action solely to avoid the
burden, expense, risk and uncertainty of continuing the various lawsuits.

Block and the plaintiffs in the Consolidated Actions have reached agreement on a Settlement
of the claims in the Consolidated Action including claims that had been pending previously
in Ohio, Maryland, and Alabama. The Settlement, if approved, would resolve all litigation
involving RALs which Block sold in Ohio between January 1, 2000 and December 23, 2005. Other
cases are also being settled at the same time, in the same settlement agreement, covering
legal rights of individuals in a number of other jurisdictions.

3. Why Is This A Class Action? 

In a class action, one or more people called Class Representatives (in this case Lynn Becker), sue
on behalf of people who have similar claims. All these people are a Class or Class Members. One
court resolves the issues for all Class Members, except for those who exclude themselves from the
Class. Circuit Court Judge Louis Bloom is in charge of this class action.

4. Why Is There A Settlement? 

The Court did not decide in favor of Block or any of the Plaintiffs in the various lawsuits. The
Plaintiffs in those lawsuits think they could have won if they went to trial. Block thinks the
Plaintiffs would have lost. In fact, in most cases, Block thinks that the Plaintiffs would not have
even been able to continue their cases in court, because Block s RAL contract required them to try
their claims before an arbitrator. But there was no trial and no arbitration. Instead, both sides
agreed to a settlement. This avoids the cost of a trial, and the people affected have an
opportunity to be paid. The Class Representative and the attorneys think the settlement is best for
all Class Members.

5. How Do I Know If I Am Part Of The Settlement? 

You received this notice because records identified you as a  Becker  class member. That means that
you fit the description of the class which the Court certified for this settlement. The Court
decided that everyone who fits this description is a Class Member:

All Ohio residents who applied for and obtained a RAL through any medium, by any name, advertised,
marketed, offered or made by or through any lender through any office operating under the trade
name of  H R Block  (including franchise or sub-franchise offices of any Settling Defendant or
Affiliate, as defined herein, or any H R Block offices such as in Sears stores) from January 1,
2000 through December 23, 2005.

There are three other classes that are part of the overall Settlement. The following classes are
composed of people who live in one of the following jurisdictions and got a RAL through an H R
Block office during the specified years:

a.) The  Cummins  Class (West Virginia residents)   January 1, 1994 to December 23, 2005;

b.)
The  Mitchell/Green  Class (residents of Maryland and Alabama)
  Maryland   January 1, 1992 to May
19, 2000, excluding those people who obtained RALs after 1996 whose RAL application contains an
arbitration clause; Alabama   June 13, 1989 through December 31, 1996;

c.)
The  State Law  Class (residents of 22 states and the District
of Columbia)   January 1, 2000
through December 23, 2005: Arkansas, Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois,
Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire,
Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington or Wisconsin.

6. What Does The Settlement Provide? 

Block has agreed to provide additional information to customers who obtain RALs and to pay a total
of $62.5 million, plus costs of notice estimated at $4 million, to settle this case. The total
Block will pay is called the  common fund. 

You are a member of the  Becker  class.  Becker  class members are entitled to more than $5.8 million
of the $62.5 million, before deductions for the pro rata portion of administration costs,
attorney s fees and expenses relating to the  Becker  Class, and service fees paid to the class
representative, Lynn Becker. The  Cummins  class members will divide $32.5 million; the State Law
class will divide more than $22.5 million; and the  Mitchell/Green  (Maryland and Alabama) class will
divide more than $1.6 million; all before the same deductions are made for administration costs,
attorney s fees and expenses, and service fees applicable to each class.

Members of the different classes who submit claims will receive different amounts because each of
these cases is at a different stage of proceedings, holds different risks and different chances of
success. Each class settlement was negotiated based upon these differences. The four classes are
represented independently.

7. How Much Will My Payments Be? 

In order to receive any payment, you must return a claim form (see Question 8 and the attached
claim form). Every Class Member who returns a valid claim form will receive at least some
distribution from the common fund. Your share of the fund will depend on the number of valid claim
forms that  Becker  Class Members send in and how many RALs you had. If every class member submitted
a claim, your share of the common fund would be a minimum of $3.66 for each RAL you obtained during
the class period. However, only a percentage of class members will actually submit claim forms. For
example, if only one of every four class members return claim forms, your share of the fund would
be $14.64 for each RAL you obtained ($3.66 times four). Your share will be reduced by whatever
percentage of the common fund is taken up with administration costs, attorney s fees, expenses, and
service payments. It is unlikely that such costs will exceed 30%, but they could be higher or
lower. Please remember that this is only an example; the amount you receive from the settlement
could be greater or smaller.

8. How Can I Get A Payment? 

To
qualify for payment, you must send in a complete and valid claim
form.  A claim form is attached
to this Notice . You may also get a claim form from the Settlement Administrator s website
  www.INSERTWEBADDRESS.com  . Read the instructions carefully, fill out the form, include all the
information the form asks for, sign it, and mail it so that it is postmarked no later than  June 30,
2006 . You may also email the claim form to the Settlement Administrator at  claims@
INSERTWEBADDRESS.com . If you email the claim form, you must do so no later than midnight on  June
30, 2006 .

9. When Would I Get My Payment? 

The Court will hold a hearing at  time/date/month/2006 at the Kanawha County Judicial Annex, 111
Court Street, Charleston, West Virginia 25301 , to decide whether to approve the settlement. If the
Court approves the settlement after that, there may be appeals. It s always uncertain whether these
appeals can be resolved, and resolving them can take time, perhaps more than a year. The settlement
administrator will keep the settlement website at  www.INSERTWEBADDRESS.com  updated so that
everyone who is in the class may keep informed of the progress of the settlement. Please be
patient. Note: It is unlikely that you will receive your payment until six months or more after the
date you send in a claim form.

10. Am I Giving Up Anything To Get A Payment Or Stay In The Class? 

Unless you exclude yourself, also called  opting out  (see Question 12), you will be considered a
member of the class, which means that you can t sue, continue to sue, or be part of any other
lawsuit against Block about the legal issues in this case. Giving up your claims is called a
 release.  Unless you exclude yourself from the settlement, you will release your claims whether or
not you submit a claim form and receive payment.

However, certain claims are not released even if you stay in the class. All claims made in other
currently existing class actions that relate to the RAL or other products and services offered by
Block are not released. Claims under state law based solely on allegations that a tax preparer
failed (A) to properly prepare a tax return or (B) to maintain the confidentiality of taxpayer
information resulting in injury based on  stolen identity  or similar misuse of taxpayer
information or theft of a RAL check; and claims to enforce the terms and conditions of the
Settlement Agreement, are similarly not released.

Class members who do not exclude themselves, but do not make a claim for money from this settlement
may choose to arbitrate their individual claims against Block for another year after the settlement
is finalized. Although Class Counsel recommend this settlement, they take no position on your
likelihood of succeeding on an individual basis in an arbitration case. You should obtain

independent legal help if you need more information about the economic value of the arbitration
alternative to excluding yourself or making a claim for money under the settlement.

The settlement requires Block to follow certain business practices with future RALs, and provides
Block with an incentive to register as a Credit Service Organization ( CSO ) in the jurisdictions
covered by the settlement. Block has two years to decide whether to register and come into
compliance with the various CSO statutes.

Important:   If  you decide to go back to Block to obtain a RAL during the two-year period Block has
to register as a CSO in the various jurisdictions,  and  Block does register and comply with your
jurisdiction s CSO statute in that two-year period, then  you will not be able to sue Block for any
new RAL violation that you claim happened during the two-year period.  But,  if Block does not
register  as a CSO  and comply  with the CSO statute in your jurisdiction, you will be able to sue
based on any new RAL violation that you claimed happened during that period. In addition, any
deadline on when you can sue Block (called the  statute of limitations ) will be suspended for the
two-year period.

11. Can I Exclude Myself From The Settlement (Sometimes Called
 Opting Out )? 

Yes, you may  opt out  and exclude yourself from the Settlement Class. If you opt out, you will not
receive any payment from the common fund, you will not release any claims you may have against
Block, and you will not be bound by anything that happens in the Consolidated Action. If you opt
out, you will be free to pursue whatever legal rights you may have by pursuing your own lawsuit
against Block at your own risk and expense.

12. What Do I Do If I Want To Exclude Myself? 

In order to opt out and exclude yourself from the Settlement Class, you must mail a  Request for
Exclusion  to the Settlement Administrator at  address . Your Request for Exclusion must be in
writing and must be postmarked no later than May 1, 2006. To be effective, a Request for Exclusion
must contain: (a) the name of this case  (Cummins. v. H   R Block, Inc.);  (b) your name, address,
social security number and telephone number; (c) a statement that you want to opt out of the
lawsuit; and (d) your signature. If the Request for Exclusion is not postmarked by the deadline,
you will be included automatically in the Settlement Class and you may be eligible to receive
Settlement payments as summarized above. Even if you do not file a claim, you will be legally bound
by the proposed Settlement, including provisions releasing Block.

13. When And Where Will The Court Decide Whether To Approve The
Settlement? 

The
Court will hold a Fairness Hearing on  time/date/ at the Kanawha County Judicial Annex, 111
Court Street, Charleston, West Virginia 25301 . At this hearing the Court will consider whether the
settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. If there are objections, the Court will consider
them. The Court will listen to people who have asked to speak at the hearing. The Court may also
decide how much to pay to Class Counsel. After the hearing, the Court will decide whether to
approve the settlement. We do not know how long these decisions will take. The hearing can be
continued at any time by the Court without any further notice to you.

14. Do I Have To Come To The Hearing? 

No. You are not required to attend the hearing. But you are welcome to come at your own expense. If
you wish to speak, you may ask the Court for permission to speak at the Fairness Hearing. To do so,
you must send a letter saying that it is your  Notice of Intention to Appear in  Cummins v. H R
Block.   Be sure to include your name, address, telephone number, and your signature. Your Notice of
Intention to Appear must be received no later than  May 1,
2006 , and be sent to the Clerk of the
Court, Class Counsel, and Defense Counsel, at the addresses in Question 16. You cannot speak at the
hearing if you excluded yourself, because once you exclude yourself, the settlement does not affect
your rights.

15. What If I Do Nothing? 

If you do nothing, you ll get no money from this settlement. But, unless you exclude yourself, you
won t be able to start a lawsuit, continue with a lawsuit, or be part of any other lawsuit against
Block about the legal issues in this case. You would, however, be able to arbitrate your claims
against Block for another year, as described in Question 10.

16. What If I Want To Object To The Settlement? 

If you re a Class Member who has not requested exclusion, you can object to the settlement if you
don t like it. If you wish to object, you must write a letter stating your objections, the specific
reasons for each objection (including any legal support you want to bring to the Court s attention)
and a description of any evidence you wish to introduce in support of your objections. You must
include your name, address, telephone number and your signature. Also include the name and number
of this action  (Cummins v. H   R Block, Inc.,  Civil Action No. 03-C-134). Your letter must be
received in these four different places no later than  May 1, 2006: 

(i) Coordinating Counsel:

Brian
A. Glasser, Esq.

Bailey   Glasser, LLP 
227 Capitol Street 
Charleston, WV 25301

(ii) Defendants  Counsel:

(iii) The Court:

Clerk of Court 
Kanawha County Circuit Court 
111 Court Street 
Charleston, WV 25301

17. What Is The Difference Between Excluding Myself And Objecting? 

Excluding yourself is telling the Court that you don t want to be part of the Class. If you
exclude yourself, you have no basis to object because the case no longer affects you. Objecting
is telling the Court that you don t like something about the settlement and you don t want the
Court to approve it. You can object only if you stay in the Class.

18. Who Are The Lawyers For The    Becker    Class? 

The Court has appointed the following law firms to represent you and other  Becker  Class
Members. These lawyers are called Class Counsel. If you want to be represented by your own
lawyer, you may hire one at your own expense.

19. How Will Class Counsel s Fees And Expenses Be Paid? 

Class Counsel will make an application to the Court for approval of an award of attorneys  fees
and expenses in an amount not more than 25% of the portion of the common fund attributable to
the  Becker  Class. The fees would pay Class Counsel for investigating the facts, litigating the
case, and negotiating the

settlement. The Court will determine the amount of any fees and expenses awarded to Class
Counsel.

20. Does The Class Representative Get Additional Compensation? 

Subject to Court approval, the named plaintiffs in the five cases which make up the Consolidated
Action will seek  service awards  for their active participation in this litigation. Any such
 service award  will be paid from the portions of the common fund attributable to the cases those
plaintiffs brought. Lynn Becker will seek a  service award  of $5,000. The Court will determine
whether Ms. Becker receives a  service award  and the amount of that award.

21. What If The Court Does Not Approve The Settlement? 

If the Court does not approve the proposed Settlement as being fair, adequate and reasonable,
the Settlement Agreement will be null and void, and all parties will be returned to their
respective pre-Settlement status in the various lawsuits that the proposed Settlement hopes to
resolve.

22. Where Do I Get Additional Information? 

This notice summarizes the proposed settlement. You can find answers to common questions about the
settlement, plus other helpful information at the Settlement Administrator s website
 www.INSERTWEBADDRESS.com . You can also get a copy of the Settlement Agreement from the website,
or by writing to the Settlement Administrator at ####. If you cannot get the information you need

1. Why Did I Get This Notice? 

You got at least one Refund Anticipation Loan ( RAL ) through an H R Block office in
Maryland between January 1, 1992 and December 31,1996, or through an H R Block office in
Alabama between June 13, 1989 and December 31, 1996. You received this notice to inform
you about settlement of a class action lawsuit that may affect your rights. This notice
provides information about all of your options, so that you can evaluate those options
before the Court decides whether to approve the settlement. Those options include making
a claim for money from the settlement (see Questions 7-9), excluding yourself from the
settlement (Questions 11   12) or raising concerns about the fairness of the settlement
(Question 16). This package explains the lawsuit, the settlement, your legal rights, what
benefits are available, who is eligible for them, and how to get them. The Court in
charge of the case is the Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia ( the
Court ).

2. What Is This Lawsuit About? 

This case combines several lawsuits that were filed against H R Block, Inc. and
various related corporations. For simplicity, the H R Block defendants are referred to
throughout the rest of this notice as simply  Block.  The cases were filed against Block
in different parts of the country at different times, but all essentially make the same
claim   that Block violated particular state laws in the way it made RALs available. The
lawyers in these cases have filed with the Court an Amended and Consolidated Class Action
Complaint (called the  Consolidated Action  from here on), which brings together all of
the claims made in these cases. One of the principal claims the Consolidated Action makes
is that Block violated the Credit Services Organization Acts of the affected
jurisdictions, or violated similar laws.

Block
denies that it violated any laws, did anything wrong, or that anyone was harmed by
its conduct. Block nevertheless has agreed to settle the Consolidated Action solely to
avoid the burden, expense, risk and uncertainty of continuing the various lawsuits.

Block and the plaintiffs in the Consolidated Actions have reached agreement on a
Settlement of the claims in the Consolidated Action including claims that had been
pending previously in Ohio, Maryland, and Alabama. The Settlement, if approved, would
resolve all litigation involving RALs which Block sold in Alabama between June 13, 1989
and December 31, 1996, and in Maryland between January 1, 1992 and December 31, 1996. Other cases are also being settled at

the same time, in the same settlement agreement, covering legal rights of
individuals in a number of other jurisdictions.

3. Why Is This A Class Action? 

In a class action, one or more people called Class Representatives (in this case Levon Mitchell
and Geral Mitchell of Alabama, and Joyce A. Green of Maryland) sue on behalf of people who have
similar claims. All these people are a Class or Class Members. One court resolves the issues for
all Class Members, except for those who exclude themselves from the Class. Circuit Court Judge
Louis Bloom is in charge of this class action.

4. Why Is There A Settlement? 

The Court did not decide in favor of Block or any of the Plaintiffs in the various lawsuits. The
Plaintiffs in those lawsuits think they could have won if they went to trial. Block thinks the
Plaintiffs would have lost. In fact, in most cases, Block thinks that the Plaintiffs would not have
even been able to continue their cases in court, because Block s RAL contract required them to try
their claims before an arbitrator. But there was no trial and no arbitration. Instead, both sides
agreed to a settlement. This avoids the cost of a trial, and the people affected have an
opportunity to be paid. The Class Representatives and the attorneys think the settlement is best
for all Class Members.

5. How Do I Know If I Am Part Of The Settlement? 

You received this notice because records identified you as a  Mitchell/Green  class member. That
means that you fit the description of the class which the Court certified for this settlement. The
Court decided that everyone who fits this description is a Class Member:

All Maryland residents who applied for and obtained a RAL at any H R Block office in Maryland from
January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1996 and did not thereafter apply for and obtain a RAL
subject to an arbitration provision, and all individuals who obtained a RAL from June 13, 1989
through December 31, 1996 through any  H R Block  office in Alabama for which the Settling
Defendants herein received a license fee payment or portion of the finance charge, and who did not
previously request exclusion from their respective classes that were previously certified or timely
request exclusion from this class.

There are three other classes that are part of the overall Settlement. The following classes are
composed of people who live in one of the following jurisdictions and got a RAL through an H R
Block office during the specified years:

a.) The  Cummins  Class (West Virginia residents)   January 1, 1994 to December 23, 2005;

b.) The  Becker  Class (residents of Ohio)   January 1, 2000 to December 23, 2005

c.) The State Law Class (residents of 22 states and the District of Columbia)   January 1, 2000
through December 23, 2005: Arkansas, Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois,
Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire,
Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington or Wisconsin.

6. What Does The Settlement Provide? 

Block has agreed to provide additional information to customers who obtain RALs and to pay a total
of $62.5 million, plus costs of notice estimated at $4 million, to settle this case. The total
Block will pay is called the  common fund. 

You are a member of the  Mitchell/Green  class.  Mitchell/Green  class members are entitled to over
$1.6 million of the $62.5 million, before deductions for the pro rata portion of administration
costs, attorney s fees and expenses relating to the  Mitchell/Green  class, and service fees paid to
the class representatives, Joyce A. Green, Levon Mitchell and Geral Mitchell. The  Cummins  class
members will divide $32.5 million; the State Law class will divide more than $22.5 million; and the
 Becker  class will divide more than $5.8 million; all before the same deductions are made for
administration costs, attorney s fees and expenses, and service fees applicable to each class.

Members of the different classes who submit claims will receive different amounts because each of
these cases is at a different stage of proceedings, holds different risks and different chances of
success. Each class settlement was negotiated based upon these differences. The four classes are
represented independently.

7. How Much Will My Payments Be? 

In order to receive any payment, you must return a claim form (see Question 8 and the attached
claim form). Every Class Member who returns a valid claim form will receive at least some
distribution from the common fund. Your share of the fund will depend on the number of valid claim
forms that  Mitchell/Green  Class Members send in and how many RALs you had. If every class member
submitted a claim, your share of the common fund would be a minimum of $3.66 for each RAL you
obtained during the class period. However, only a percentage of class members will actually
submit claim forms. For example, if only one of every four class members return claim forms, your
share of the fund would be $14.64 for each RAL you obtained ($3.66 times four). Your share will be
reduced by whatever percentage of the common fund is taken up with administration costs, attorney s
fees, expenses, and service payments. It is unlikely that such costs will exceed 30%, but they
could be higher or lower. Please remember that

this is only an example; the amount you receive from the settlement could be greater or smaller.

8. How Can I Get A Payment? 

To qualify
for payment, you must send in a complete and valid claim form.  A claim form is attached
to this Notice.  You may also get a claim  form from the  Settlement Administrator s website
  www.INSERTWEBADDRESS.com  . Read the instructions carefully, fill out the form, include all the
information  the form asks  for, sign it, and mail it so that it
is postmarked no later than  June 30,
2006.  You may also email the claim form to the Settlement
Administrator at   claims@ INSERTWEBADDRESS.com . If you email the claim form, you must do so no later than midnight on  June
30, 2006. 

9. When Would I Get My Payment? 

The Court
will hold a hearing at  time/date/month/2006  at  the Kanawha County Judicial Annex, 111
Court Street, Charleston, West Virginia 25301,  to decide whether to approve the settlement. If the
Court approves the settlement after that, there may be appeals. It s always uncertain whether these
appeals can be resolved, and resolving them can take time, perhaps more than a year. The settlement
administrator will keep the settlement website at  www.INSERTWEBADDRESS.com  updated so that
everyone who is in the class may keep informed of the progress of the settlement. Please be
patient. Note: It is unlikely that you will receive your payment until six months or more after the
date you send in a claim form.

10. Am I Giving Up Anything To Get A Payment Or Stay In The Class? 

Unless you exclude yourself, also called  opting out  (see Question 12), you will be
considered a member of the class, which means that you can t sue, continue to sue, or be
part of any other lawsuit against Block about the legal issues in this case. Giving up
your claims is called a  release.  Unless you exclude yourself from the settlement, you
will release your claims whether or not you submit a claim form and receive payment.

However, certain claims are not released even if you stay in the class. All claims made
in other currently existing class actions that relate to the RAL or other products and
services offered by Block are not released. Claims under state law based solely on
allegations that a tax preparer failed (A) to properly prepare a tax return or (B) to
maintain the confidentiality of taxpayer information resulting in injury based on
 stolen identity  or similar misuse of taxpayer information or theft of a RAL check; and
claims to enforce the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement, are similarly
not released.

Class members who do not exclude themselves, but do not make a claim for money from this settlement may choose to arbitrate their individual claims

against Block for another year after the settlement is finalized. Although Class Counsel recommend
this settlement, they take no position on your likelihood of succeeding on an individual basis in
an arbitration case. You should obtain independent legal help if you need more information about
the economic value of the arbitration alternative to excluding yourself or making a claim for money
under the settlement.

The settlement requires Block to follow certain business practices with future RALs.

11. Can I Exclude Myself From The Settlement (Sometimes Called  Opting Out )? 

Yes, you may  opt out  and exclude yourself from the Settlement Class. If you opt out, you
will not receive any payment from the common fund, you will not release any claims you may have
against Block, and you will not be bound by anything that happens in the Consolidated Action. If
you opt out, you will be free to pursue whatever legal rights you may have by pursuing your own
lawsuit against Block at your own risk and expense.

12. What Do I Do If I Want To Exclude Myself? 

In order to opt out and exclude yourself from the Settlement Class, you must mail a  Request for
Exclusion  to the Settlement Administrator at  address.  Your Request for Exclusion must be in
writing and must be postmarked no later than May 1, 2006. To be effective, a Request for Exclusion
must contain: (a) the name of this case  (Cummins. v. H  R Block, Inc.);  (b) your name, address,
social security number and telephone number; (c) a statement that you want to opt out of the
lawsuit; and (d) your signature. If the Request for Exclusion is not postmarked by the deadline,
you will be included automatically in the Settlement Class and you may be eligible to receive
Settlement payments as summarized above. Even if you do not file a claim, you will be legally bound
by the proposed Settlement, including provisions releasing Block.

13. When And Where Will The Court Decide Whether To Approve The Settlement? 

The Court
will hold a Fairness Hearing on  time/date/ at the Kanawha County Judicial Annex,
111 Court Street, Charleston, West Virginia 25301.  At this hearing the Court will consider whether
the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. If there are objections, the Court will consider
them. The Court will listen to people who have asked to speak at the hearing. The Court may also
decide how much to pay to Class Counsel. After the hearing, the Court will decide whether to
approve the settlement. We do not know how long these decisions will take. The hearing can be
continued at any time by the Court without any further notice to you.

14. Do I Have To Come To The Hearing? 

No, You are not required to attend the hearing. But you are welcome to come at your own expense. If
you wish to speak, you may ask the Court for permission to speak at the Fairness Hearing. To do so,
you must send a letter saying that it is your  Notice of Intention to Appear in  Cummins v. H R
Block.   Be sure to include your name, address, telephone number, and your signature. Your Notice of
Intention to Appear must be received no later than  May 1,
2006,  and be sent to the Clerk of the
Court, Class Counsel, and Defense Counsel, at the addresses in Question 16. You cannot speak at the
hearing if you excluded yourself, because once you exclude yourself, the settlement does not affect
your rights.

15. What If I Do Nothing? 

If you do nothing, you ll get no money from this settlement. But, unless you exclude yourself, you
won t be able to start a lawsuit, continue with a lawsuit, or be part of any other lawsuit against
Block about the legal issues in this case. You would, however, be able to arbitrate your claims
against Block for another year, as described in Question 10.

16. What If I Want To Object To The Settlement? 

If you re a Class Member who has not requested exclusion, you can object to the settlement if you
don t like it. If you wish to object, you must write a letter stating your objections, the specific
reasons for each objection (including any legal support you want to bring to the Court s attention)
and a description of any evidence you wish to introduce in support of your objections. You must
include your name, address, telephone number and your signature. Also include the name and number
of this action  (Cummins v. H R Block, Inc.,  Civil Action No. 03-C-134). Your letter must be received
in these four different places no later than  May 1, 2006: 

(i) Coordinating Counsel:

227 Capitol Street 
Charleston, WV 25301

(iii) The Court:

Clerk of Court 
Kanawha County Circuit Court 
111 Court Street 
Charleston, WV 25301

17. What Is The Difference Between Excluding Myself And Objecting? 

Excluding yourself is telling the Court that you don t want to be part of the Class. If you exclude
yourself, you have no basis to object because the case no longer affects you. Objecting is telling
the Court that you don t like something about the settlement and you don t want the Court to
approve it. You can object only if you stay in the Class.

18. Who Are The Lawyers For The    Mitchell/Green    Class? 

The Court has appointed the following law firms to represent you and other  Mitchell/Green  Class
Members. These lawyers are called Class Counsel. If you want to be represented by your own lawyer,
you may hire one at your own expense.

Class Counsel will make an application to the Court for approval of an award of attorneys  fees and
expenses in an amount not more than 25% of the portion of the common fund attributable to the
 Mitchell/Green  Class. The fees would pay Class Counsel for investigating the facts, litigating the
case, and negotiating the settlement. The Court will determine the amount of any fees and expenses
awarded to Class Counsel.

20. Does The Class Representative Get Additional Compensation? 

Subject to Court approval, the named plaintiffs in the five cases which make up the Consolidated
Action will seek  service awards  for their active participation in this litigation. Any such
 service award  will be paid from the portions of the common fund attributable to the cases those
plaintiffs brought. Joyce A. Green, Levon Mitchell and Geral Mitchell will seek a  service award 
of $5,000. The Court will determine whether they receive a  service award  and the amount of that
award.

21. What If The Court Does Not Approve The Settlement? 

If the Court does not approve the proposed Settlement as being fair, adequate and reasonable,
the Settlement Agreement will be null and void, and all parties will be returned to their
respective pre-Settlement status in the various lawsuits that the proposed Settlement hopes to

1. Why Did I Get This Notice? 

You got at least one Refund Anticipation Loan ( RAL ) through an H R Block office between January
1, 2000 and December 23, 2005. You received this notice to inform you about settlement of a class
action lawsuit that may affect your rights. This notice provides information about all of your
options, so that you can evaluate those options before the Court decides whether to approve the
settlement. Those options include making a claim for money from the settlement (see Questions 7-9),
excluding yourself from the settlement (Questions 11   12) or raising concerns about the fairness
of the settlement (Question 16). This package explains the lawsuit, the settlement, your legal
rights, what benefits are available, who is eligible for them, and how to get them. The Court in
charge of the case is the Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia ( the Court ).

2. What Is This Lawsuit About? 

This case combines several lawsuits that were filed against H R Block, Inc. and various
related corporations. For simplicity, the H  R Block defendants are referred to
throughout the rest of this notice as simply  Block.  The cases were filed against Block
in different parts of the country at different times, but all essentially make the same
claim   that Block violated particular state laws in the way it made RALs available. The
lawyers in these cases have filed with the Court an Amended and Consolidated Class Action
Complaint (called the  Consolidated Action  from here on), which brings together all of
the claims made in these cases. One of the principal claims the Consolidated Action makes
is that Block violated the Credit Services Organization Acts of the affected
jurisdictions, or violated similar laws.

Block denies that it violated any laws, did anything wrong, or that anyone was harmed by
its conduct. Block nevertheless has agreed to settle the Consolidated Action solely to
avoid the burden, expense, risk and uncertainty of continuing the various lawsuits.

Block and the plaintiffs in the Consolidated Actions have reached agreement on a
Settlement of the claims in the Consolidated Action including claims that had been
pending previously in Ohio, Maryland, and Alabama. The Settlement, if approved, would
resolve all litigation involving RALs which Block sold in Arkansas, Arizona, California,
District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine,
Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin between January 1, 2000 and December
23, 2005.

Other cases are also being settled at the same time, in the same settlement agreement,
covering legal rights of individuals in a number of other jurisdictions.

3. Why Is This A Class Action? 

In a class action, one or more people called Class Representatives (in this case Renea Griffith,
Maryanne Hoekman and Justin Sevey), sue on behalf of people who have similar claims. All these
people are a Class or Class Members. One court resolves the issues for all Class Members, except
for those who exclude themselves from the Class. Circuit Court Judge Louis Bloom is in charge of
this class action.

4. Why Is There A Settlement? 

The Court did not decide in favor of Block or any of the Plaintiffs in the various lawsuits. The
Plaintiffs in those lawsuits think they could have won if they went to trial. Block thinks the
Plaintiffs would have lost. In fact, in most cases, Block thinks that the Plaintiffs would not have
even been able to continue their cases in court, because Block s RAL contract required them to try
their claims before an arbitrator. But there was no trial and no arbitration. Instead, both sides
agreed to a settlement. This avoids the cost of a trial, and the people affected have an
opportunity to be paid. The Class Representatives and the attorneys think the settlement is best
for all Class Members.

5. How Do I Know If I Am Part Of The Settlement? 

You received this notice because records identified you as a State Law class member. That means
that you fit the description of the class which the Court certified for this settlement. The Court
decided that everyone who fits this description is a Class Member:

All residents of Arkansas, Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Indiana,
Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Nevada,
Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin who applied for and
obtained a RAL through any medium, by any name, advertised, marketed, offered or made by or through
any lender through any office operating under the trade name of  H R Block  (including franchise or
sub-franchise offices of any Settling Defendant or Affiliate, or any H R Block offices such as in
Sears stores) from January 1, 2000 through December 23, 2005.

There are three other classes that are part of the overall Settlement. The following classes are
composed of people who live in one of the following jurisdictions and got a RAL through an H R
Block office during the specified years:

a.) The  Cummins  Class (West Virginia residents)   January 1, 1994 to December 23, 2005;

b.) The  Mitchell/Green  Class (residents of Maryland and Alabama)   Maryland   January 1,1992 to May
19, 2000, excluding those people who obtained RALs after 1996 whose RAL application contains an
arbitration clause; Alabama   June 13, 1989 through December 31, 1996;

c.) The  Becker  Class (residents of Ohio)   January 1, 2000 through December 23, 2005.

6. What Does The Settlement Provide? 

Block has agreed to provide additional information to customers who obtain RALs and to pay a total
of $62.5 million, plus costs of notice estimated at $4 million, to settle this case. The total
Block will pay is called the  common fund. 

You are a member of the State Law Class. State Law class members are entitled to over $22.5 million
of the $62.5 million, before deductions for the pro rata portion of administration costs,
attorney s fees and expenses relating to the State Law class, and service fees paid to the class
representatives, Renea Griffith, Maryanne Hoekman and Justin Sevey. The  Cummins  class members will
divide $32.5 million; the Becker class will divide over $5.8 million; and the  Mitchell/Green 
(Maryland and Alabama) class will divide more than $1.6 million; all before the same deductions are
made for administration costs, attorney s fees and expenses, and service fees applicable to each
class.

Members of the different classes who submit claims will receive different amounts because each of
these cases is at a different stage of proceedings, holds different risks and different chances of
success. Each class settlement was negotiated based upon these differences. The four classes are
represented independently.

7. How Much Will My Payments Be? 

In order to receive any payment, you must return a claim form (see Question 8 and the attached
claim form). Every Class Member who returns a valid claim form will receive at least some
distribution from the common fund. Your share of the fund will depend on the number of valid claim
forms that State Law Class Members send in and how many RALs you had. If every class member
submitted a claim, your share of the common fund would be a minimum of $1.67 for each RAL you
obtained during the class period. However, only a percentage of class members will actually
submit claim forms. For example, if only one of every four class members return claim forms, your
share of the fund would be $6.68 for each RAL you obtained ($1.67 times four). Your share will be
reduced by whatever percentage of the common fund is taken up with administration costs, attorney s
fees, expenses, and service payments. It is unlikely that such costs will exceed 30%, but they
could be higher or lower. Please remember that this is only an example; the amount you receive from
the settlement could be greater or smaller.

8. How Can I Get A Payment? 

To qualify for payment, you must send in a complete and valid claim form.  A claim form is
attached to this Notice.  You may also get a claim form from the Settlement
Administrator s website   www.INSERTWEBADDRESS.com  . Read the instructions carefully, fill
out the form, include all the information the form asks for, sign it, and mail it so that
it is postmarked no later than  June 30, 2006.  You may also email the claim form to the
Settlement Administrator at  claims@INSERTWEBADDRESS.com . If you email the claim form,
you must do so no later than midnight on  June 30, 2006. 

9. When Would I Get My Payment? 

The Court will hold a hearing at  time/date/month/2006 at the Kanawha County Judicial
Annex, 111 Court Street, Charleston, West Virginia 25301,  to decide whether to approve
the settlement. If the Court approves the settlement after that, there may be appeals.
It s always uncertain whether these appeals can be resolved, and resolving them can take
time, perhaps more than a year. The settlement administrator will keep the settlement
website at  www.INSERTWEBADDRESS.com  updated so that everyone who is in the class may
keep informed of the progress of the settlement. Please be patient.

Note: It is unlikely that you will receive your payment until six months or more after
the date you send in a claim form.

10. Am I Giving Up Anything To Get A Payment Or Stay In The Class? 

Unless you exclude yourself, also called  opting out  (see Question 12), you will be
considered a member of the class, which means that you can t sue, continue to sue, or be
part of any other lawsuit against Block about the legal issues in this case. Giving up
your claims is called a  release.  Unless you exclude yourself from the settlement, you
will release your claims whether or not you submit a claim form and receive payment.

However, certain claims are not released even if you stay in the class. All claims made
in other currently existing class actions that relate to the RAL or other products and
services offered by Block are not released. Claims under state law based solely on
allegations that a tax preparer failed (A) to properly prepare a tax return or (B) to
maintain the confidentiality of taxpayer information resulting in injury based on  stolen
identity  or similar misuse of taxpayer information or theft of a RAL check; and claims
to enforce the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement, are similarly not
released.

Class members who do not exclude themselves, but do not make a claim for money from this
settlement may choose to arbitrate their individual claims against Block for another year
after the settlement is finalized. Although Class Counsel recommend this settlement, they
take no position on your likelihood of succeeding on an individual basis in an arbitration case. You should obtain

independent legal help if you need more information about the economic value of the arbitration
alternative to excluding yourself or making a claim for money under the settlement.

The settlement requires Block to follow certain business practices with future RALs, and provides
Block with an incentive to register as a Credit Service Organization ( CSO ) in the jurisdictions
covered by the settlement. Block has two years to decide whether to register and come into
compliance with the various CSO statutes.

Important :  If  you decide to go back to Block to obtain a RAL during the two-year period Block has
to register as a CSO in the various jurisdictions,  and  Block does register and comply with your
jurisdiction s CSO statute in that two-year period, then  you will not be able to sue Block for any
new RAL violation that you claim happened during the two-year period.  But,  if Block does not
register  as a CSO  and comply  with the CSO statute in your jurisdiction, you will be able to sue
based on any new RAL violation that you claimed happened during that period. In addition, any
deadline on when you can sue Block (called the  statute of limitations ) will be suspended for the
two-year period.

11. Can I Exclude Myself From The Settlement (Sometimes Called  Opting Out )? 

Yes, you may  opt out  and exclude yourself from the Settlement Class. If you opt out, you will not
receive any payment from the common fund, you will not release any claims you may have against
Block, and you will not be bound by anything that happens in the Consolidated Action. If you opt
out, you will be free to pursue whatever legal rights you may have by pursuing your own lawsuit
against Block at your own risk and expense.

12. What Do I Do If I Want To Exclude Myself? 

In order to opt out and exclude yourself from the Settlement Class, you must mail a  Request for
Exclusion  to the Settlement Administrator at  address.  Your Request for Exclusion must be in
writing and must be postmarked no later than May 1, 2006. To be effective, a Request for Exclusion
must contain: (a) the name of this case  (Cummins. v. H  
R Block, Inc.) ; (b) your name, address,
social security number and telephone number; (c) a statement that you want to opt out of the
lawsuit; and (d) your signature. If the Request for Exclusion is not postmarked by the deadline,
you will be included automatically in the Settlement Class and you may be eligible to receive
Settlement payments as summarized above. Even if you do not file a claim, you will be legally bound
by the proposed Settlement, including provisions releasing Block.

13. When And Where Will The Court Decide Whether To Approve The Settlement? 

The Court will hold a Fairness Hearing on  time/date/ at the Kanawha County Judicial Annex, 111
Court Street, Charleston, West Virginia 25301.  At this hearing the Court will consider whether the
settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. If there are objections, the Court will consider
them. The Court will listen to people who have asked to speak at the hearing. The Court may also
decide how much to pay to Class Counsel. After the hearing, the Court will decide whether to
approve the settlement. We do not know how long these decisions will take. The hearing can be
continued at any time by the Court without any further notice to you.

14. Do I Have To Come To The Hearing? 

No. You are not required to attend the hearing. But you are welcome to come at your own expense. If
you wish to speak, you may ask the Court for permission to speak at the Fairness Hearing. To do so,
you must send a letter saying that it is your  Notice of Intention to Appear in  Cummins v. H R
Block.   Be sure to include your name, address, telephone number, and your signature. Your Notice of
Intention to Appear must be received no later than  May 1, 2006 , and be sent to the Clerk of the
Court, Class Counsel, and Defense Counsel, at the addresses in Question 16. You cannot speak at the
hearing if you excluded yourself, because once you exclude yourself, the settlement does not affect
your rights.

15. What If I Do Nothing? 

If you do nothing, you ll get no money from this settlement. But, unless you exclude yourself, you
won t be able to start a lawsuit, continue with a lawsuit, or be part of any other lawsuit against
Block about the legal issues in this case. You would, however, be able to arbitrate your claims
against Block for another year, as described in Question 10.

16. What If I Want To Object To The Settlement? 

If you re a Class Member who has not requested exclusion, you can object to the settlement if you
don t like it. If you wish to object, you must write a letter stating your objections, the specific
reasons for each objection (including any legal support you want to bring to the Court s attention)
and a description of any evidence you wish to introduce in support of your objections. You must
include your name, address, telephone number and your signature. Also include the name and number
of this action  (Cummins v. H   R Block, Inc.,  Civil Action No. 03-C-134). Your letter must be
received in these four different places no later than  May 1, 2006: 

(i) Coordinating Counsel:

Brian A.Glasser, Esq.

17. What Is The Difference Between Excluding Myself And Objecting? 

Excluding yourself is telling the Court that you don t want to be part of the Class. If you
exclude yourself, you have no basis to object because the case no longer affects you. Objecting is
telling the Court that you don t like something about the settlement and you don t want the Court
to approve it. You can object only if you stay in the Class.

18. Who Are The Lawyers For The State Law Class? 

The Court has appointed the following law firms to represent you and other State Law Class Members.
These lawyers are called Class Counsel. If you want to be represented by your own lawyer, you may
hire one at your own expense.

19. How Will Class Counsel s Fees And Expenses Be Paid? 

Class Counsel will make an application to the Court for approval of an award of attorneys  fees and
expenses in an amount not more than 25% of the portion of the common fund attributable to the State
Law Class. The fees would pay Class Counsel for investigating the facts, litigating the case, and
negotiating the settlement. The Court will determine the amount of any fees and expenses awarded to
Class Counsel.

20. Does The Class Representative Get Additional Compensation? 

Subject to Court approval, the named plaintiffs in the five cases which make up the Consolidated
Action will seek  service awards  for their active participation in this litigation. Any such
 service award  will be paid from the portions of the common fund attributable to the cases those
plaintiffs brought. Renea Griffith, Maryanne Hoekman and Justin Sevey will seek a  service award 
of $5,000. The Court will determine whether they receive  service awards  and the amount of their
award.

21. What If The Court Does Not Approve The Settlement? 

If the Court does not approve the proposed Settlement as being fair, adequate and reasonable,
the Settlement Agreement will be null and void, and all parties will be returned to their
respective pre-Settlement status in the various lawsuits that the proposed Settlement hopes to
resolve.

22. Where Do I Get Additional Information? 

This notice summarizes the proposed settlement. You can find answers to common questions about the
settlement, plus other helpful information at the Settlement Administrator s website
 www.INSERTWEBADDRESS.com . You can also get a copy of the Settlement Agreement from the website,
or by writing to the Settlement Administrator at ####. If you cannot get the information you need
from this notice or from the Settlement Administrator, you may contact State Law Class Counsel.

SUMMARY NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED 
 SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION AND HEARING 

If You Got A Refund Anticipation Loan From H R Block 
This Notice Concerns Settlement Of A Lawsuit Which May Affect You 

This
Notice is given pursuant to Rule 23 of the West Virginia Rules of Civil
Procedure and the December   , 2005 Order of the Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia
( Court ) in a case called  Cummins v. H R Block, Inc.,  Civil Action No. 03-C-134. A settlement has
been proposed in a class action lawsuit about the way that H R Block offered refund anticipation
loans ( RALs ). If you qualify, you may send in a claim form to get money, you can exclude yourself
from the settlement, or you can object to it. The Circuit Court Of Kanawha County, West Virginia
( the Court ) authorized this notice. Before any money is paid, the Court will have a hearing to
decide whether to approve the settlement.

What Is The Lawsuit About? 

The lawsuit claimed that H R Block violated certain state laws in the way it offered
RALs. H R Block denies that it did anything wrong. The Court did not decide which side was right.
But both sides agreed to the settlement to resolve the case and get benefits to RAL customers. The
two sides disagree on how much money could have been won if the RAL customers who brought the suit
had won at a trial.

Who Is Included In The Settlement? 

You are a Class Member if you got a RAL through an H R Block office between 2000 and
2005 and live in one of the following jurisdictions:

Arkansas, Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Indiana,
Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Nevada,
Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington or Wisconsin.

You are also a Class Member if you live in one of the following states and got a RAL through
an H R Block office during the specified years:

West Virginia   1994 through 2005 
     Maryland   1992 through 1996 
     Alabama   June 13, 1989 through 1996

you will not receive any money from the settlement  but you will still be entitled to pursue an
individual claim against Block in an arbitration forum for a period of one year. If you don t want
to be legally bound by the settlement, you must exclude yourself by May 1, 2006, or you won t be
able to sue, or continue to sue, H R Block about the legal claims in this case in any forum. If
you exclude yourself, you can t get money from this settlement. If you stay in the settlement, you
may object to it by May 1, 2006. The detailed notice explains how to exclude yourself or object.
The Court will hold a hearing in this case on  day/date/2006,  to consider whether to approve the
settlement and a request by the eight law firms representing the different Class Members for an
award of attorneys  fees and costs for investigating the facts, litigating the case, and

3.
 Applicable Law . This Application and all the other documents executed in connection with
this Application or my RAL (collectively,  Documents ) shall be governed by and construed, interpreted, and enforced in
accordance with federal law and, to the extent state law applies, the law of the State of Delaware
(without reference to conflict of laws principles).

4.
 Important Information About RALs.  I understand that: (a) I can file my federal income
tax return electronically without obtaining a RAL; (b) the IRS will send me a refund check or
electronically deposit my refund to my existing bank account: (c) the IRS normally sends a refund
check by mail within 3 weeks after an electronic filing; (d) the IRS normally makes an electronic
deposit in an average of about 12 days after an electronic
filing; (e) HSBC tries to make proceeds
of an instant RAL available on the day of application and a Classic RAL available on the first
business day after application; (f) HSBC cannot guarantee when any proceeds of a RAL or an IRS
refund will be available to me: and (g) a RAL may cost substantially more than other sources of
credit, and I may want to consider using other sources of credit.

5.  Deposit Authorization.  (a) After I sign my Application, my ERO and/or my
Transmitter will electronically transmit my tax return to the IRS and my Application to
HSBC, I understand that I will sign or authorize an IRS Transmittal Form 8453 or IRS
e-file signature authorization ( Deposit Authorization ) as
part of my Application and
electronic tax filing, and that the Deposit Authorization and this Application provide an
irrevocable agreement to have my tax refund disbursed to HSBC, and irrevocably transfers
to HSBC all of my rights, title, and interest in the proceeds of my tax refund for
purposes of the RAL I have requested and other purposes authorized by
this Application.
(b) If my Application is denied or cancelled, and HSBC receives my tax refund, HSBC will
forward to me promptly any proceeds of my refund after deducting amounts permitted by this
Agreement. (c) If for any reason, any part of the anticipated tax refund is disallowed or
offset by the IRS, or if I should receive a refund check in the mail,
I will advise HSBC
immediately and promptly pay HSBC any amounts owing with respect to my Application or a
RAL, and pay my ERO and/or my Transmitter any fees owed to them involving my tax return.

6.
 Refund Account.  (a) I request that a Refund Account be opened at HSBC upon receipt of
my tax refund for the purposes of ensuring the repayment of my RAL and other amounts described in
the Documents. The Annual Percentage Yield and interest rate on the
Refund Account will be 0%. This
means I will not receive any interest on funds in the Refund Account. I understand that I cannot
make withdrawals from the Refund Account and that the funds in the Refund Account will be disbursed
only as expressly provided in the Documents. (b) HSBC may deduct
any amounts I owe HSBC, my ERO, my
Transmitter or their affiliates from my tax refund, any funds received in the Refund Account, and
any proceeds of a RAL. My engagement with the ERO for services in connection with my 2004 income
tax return will end, and I am required to pay all fees to the ERO for
services rendered by the ERO, when I pick up my check for a RAL (or
when HSBC electronically transfers my proceeds to me or to another
entity at my direction). If a
check or an electronic transfer of proceeds is not made available to me because I do not receive a
tax refund, then I am required to pay all fees to the ERO for services rendered by the ERO on
demand, HSBC also may withdraw amounts deposited into the Refund Account from my tax refund to pay
any check I receive for a RAL that I endorse and present for payment or to disburse money to me in
accordance with my Application. (c) I will not receive a periodic statement for the Refund Account,
but I will receive notice if funds in the Refund Account are not
sufficient to repay my RAL or are
used for any purpose other than repayment of my RAL or disbursement to me. HSBC may, immediately
after disbursement of all funds in the Refund Account, close the account without further notice to
or authorization from me.

7.
 Refund Account Fee.  I will pay HSBC a fee of $24.95 for
the administration of the Refund Account and any disbursements to me from that
account ( Refund Account Fee ), I irrevocably commit to pay the Refund Account
Fee after the Deposit Authorization is filed with the IRS regardless of whether
(a) I apply for a RAL or (b) my Application is approved or denied. The Refund
Account Fee is not imposed directly or indirectly as an incident to or condition
of any extension of credit. I can avoid the Refund Account Fee if I direct that
my tax refund not be deposited to HSBC before filing my Deposit Authorization
with the IRS.

8.  No Fiduciary/Agency Duty.  I understand that for various fees received, my ERO is acting
only at my tax preparer (if applicable), my electronic filer and the deliverer of checks for RALs
with respect to this RAL transaction. I understand that an affiliate of my ERO may purchase an
interest in my RAL issued by HSBC. I further understand that my ERO is not acting in a fiduciary,
confidential, or agency capacity with respect to me in connection with this transaction and has no
other duties to me beyond the preparation of my tax return (if applicable), the transmission of my
tax return information to HSBC, the electronic filing of my tax return with the IRS, and the
delivery of checks for RALs. I acknowledge that I have independently evaluated and decided to apply
for a RAL, and that I am not relying on any recommendation from my ERO. I also understand that HSBC
is not acting in a fiduciary, confidential, or agency capacity with respect to me in connection
with this transaction.

9.  Disclosure Information.  (a)  Information  means my 2004 federal and state income tax
returns, any information obtained in connection with my tax return (including information relating
to a possible offset of my tax refund or the possibility that my tax return is incorrect), and any
information relating to my Application or a RAL, RAC, or similar financial service I have received
or requested from HSBC. (b)  Authorized Parties  means HSBC, HSBC TFS, my ERO, my Transmitter,
and their respective affiliates and agents, and includes the Fraud Service Bureau operated for
HSBC. (c) The Authorized Parties may share Information to process my Application, to determine

institutions that provide RALs, RACs, or other financial services. (e) The Authorized Parties may

may not use or disclose Information for any purpose, except as permitted under Treas. Reg. Sec.
301.7216-2 or as provided in this Application. (g) I consent to HSBC sharing information as
provided in the Privacy Statement.

provide me with a copy of my Application, loan agreement, billing statement or other document HSBC
may charge me $10 per document.

11.  Arbitration Provision.  Any claim, dispute or controversy between me and HSBC (as

Provision), whether in contract or tort

advertisements, promotions, or oral or written statements related to this or any other Application
for a RAL or any RAL or RAC that I have previously requested or received from HSBC, (c) the
relationship of HSBC and me relating to any of these or any other Documents or any RAL or RAC that
I have previously requested or received from HSBC; and (d) except as provided below, the validity,
enforceability or scope of this Arbitration Provision or any part thereof, including but not limited
to, the issue whether any particular claim, dispute or controversy must be submitted to arbitration
(collectively the  Claim ), shall be resolved, upon the election of either me or HSBC, by binding
arbitration pursuant to this Arbitration Provision and the applicable rules of the American
Arbitration Association ( AAA ) or the National Arbitration
Forum ( NAF ) in effect at the time the Claim is filed. I shall have the right to
select one of these arbitration administrators (the  Administrator ). The arbitrator must be a
lawyer with more than ten (10) years of experience or a retired or former judge. In the event of a
conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the rules of the Administrator, this Arbitration
Provision shall govern. In the event of a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the
balance of this Application or any other Documents, this Arbitration Provision shall govern.
Notwithstanding any language in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, no arbitration may be
administered, without the consent of all parties to the arbitration, by any organization that has
in place a formal or informal policy that is inconsistent with and purports to override the terms
of this Arbitration Provision, including the Class Action Wavier Provision defined below.

HSBC hereby agrees not to invoke its right to arbitrate an individual Claim I may bring in
small claims court or an equivalent court, if any, so long as the
Claim is pending only in that
court. No class actions or private attorney general actions in court or in arbitration or joinder
or consolidation of claims in court or in arbitration with other persons, are permitted without the
consent of HSBC and me. The validity and effect of the preceding sentence (herein referred to as
the  Class Action Waiver Provision ) shall be determined exclusively by a court and not by the
Administrator or any arbitrator. Neither the Administrator nor any arbitrator shall have the power
or authority to waive, modify or fail to enforce the Class Action Waiver Provision, and any attempt
to do so, whether by rule, policy, arbitration decision or otherwise, shall be invalid and
unenforceable.

Any arbitration hearing that I attend will take place in a location that is reasonably
convenient for me. On any Claim I file, I will pay the first $50.00 of the filing fee. At my
request, HSBC will pay the remainder of the filing fee and any administrative or hearing fees
charged by the Administrator, up to $1,500.00 on any Claim asserted by me in the arbitration. If I
should be required to pay any additional fees to the Administrator, HSBC will consider a request by
me to pay all or part of the additional fees; however, HSBC shall not be obligated to pay any
additional fees unless the arbitrator grants me an award. If the arbitrator grants an award in my
favor, HSBC will reimburse me for any additional fees paid or owed by me to the Administrator up to
the amount of the fees that would have been charged if the original Claim had been for the amount
of the actual award in my favor. If the arbitrator issues an award in HSBC s favor, I will not be
required to reimburse HSBC for any fees HSBC has previously paid to the Administrator or for which
HSBC is responsible.

This Arbitration Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce,
and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
Sections 1-16 (the  FAA ). The arbitrator shall apply substantive law consistent with
the FAA, and not by any state law concerning arbitration. The arbitrator shall follow and apply
applicable substantive law to the

HSBC COPY 

extent consistent with the FAA, statutes of limitation and claims of privilege and shall be
authorized to award all remedies permitted by applicable substantive law, including, without
limitation, compensatory, statutory and punitive damages, declaratory, injunctive and other
equitable relief and attorneys  fees and costs. The arbitrator will follow rules of procedure and
evidence consistent with the FAA, this Arbitration Provision and, to the extent consistent with
this Arbitration Provision, the Administrator s rules Upon request of either party, the arbitrator
shall prepare a short reasoned written opinion supporting the arbitration award. Judgment upon the
award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator s award will be final and
binding except for: (a) any appeal right under the FAA: and (b) any appeal of Claims involving more
than $100,000. For such Claims, any party may appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel
appointed by the Administrator, which will reconsider de novo (i.e., in its entirety) any aspect or
all aspects of the initial award that is appealed. The panel s decision will be final and binding,
except for any appeal right under the FAA. Unless applicable law provides otherwise, the appealing
party will pay the appeal s costs (i.e., the amounts owed to the Administrator and the arbitrators),
regardless of its outcome. However, HSBC will consider in good faith any reasonable request for
HSBC to bear up to the full costs of the appeal. Nothing in this Arbitration Provision shall be
construed to prevent HSBC s use of offset or other contractual rights involving payment of my
income tax refund or other amount on deposit with HSBC to pay off any RAL, RAC, or similar
financial service, or ERO or other foes, now or thereafter owed by me to HSBC or any Other RAL
Lender or ERO or third party pursuant to the Documents or similar prior documents.

I
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN COURT BEFORE A
JUDGE OR JURY, BUT I
PREFER TO RESOLVE ANY SUCH CLAIMS THROUGH ARBITRATION AND HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE MY
RIGHTS TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, UPON ELECTION OF ARBITRATION BY
HSBC OR BY ME. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR
MEMBER OF ANY CLASS OF CLAIMANTS OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PERTAINING TO ANY CLAIM SUBJECT

previous RAL or RAC application or related agreement and shall survive repayment of any RAL or RAC
and termination of my accounts: provided, however, that if I reject this Arbitration Provision as set below, any prior Arbitration
Provisions shall remain in full force and effect. If any portion of this Arbitration Provision is
deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of this Arbitration
Provision. However, if a determination is made that the Class Action Waiver Provision is
unenforceable, this Arbitration Provision (other than this sentence) and any prior Arbitration
Provision shall be null and void.

may be financial services providers (such as mortgage bankers or insurance agents) or they may be
non-financial companies (such as retailers, tax preparers, or marketing companies). These offers
are typically for products and services that you might not otherwise hear about. The information we
may provide them comes from the sources described above and might include your name, address and
phone number. You may tell us not to share information with non-affiliated companies in this way by

SUMMARY NOTICE OF PENDENCY AND PROPOSED 
 SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION AND HEARING 

If You Got A Refund Anticipation Loan From H R
Block   This Notice Concerns Settlement Of A Lawsuit Which May
Affect You 

This Notice is given pursuant to Rule 23 of the West Virginia Rules of Civil
Procedure and the
December                       , 2005 Order of the Circuit Court of
Kanawha County, West Virginia ( Court ) in a case called  Cummins v. H R Block, Inc.,  Civil Action
No. 03-C-134. A settlement has been proposed in a class action lawsuit about the way that H R Block
offered refund anticipation loans ( RALs ). If you qualify, you may send in a claim form to get
money, you can exclude yourself from the settlement, or you can object to it. The Circuit Court Of
Kanawha County, West Virginia ( the Court ) authorized this notice. Before any money is paid, the
Court will have a hearing to decide whether to approve the settlement.

What Is The Lawsuit About? 

The lawsuit claimed that H R Block violated certain state laws in the way it offered
RALs. H R Block denies that it did anything wrong. The Court did not decide which side was right.
But both sides agreed to the settlement to resolve the case and get benefits to RAL customers. The
two sides disagree on how much money could have been won if the RAL customers who brought the suit
had won at a trial.

Who Is Included In The Settlement? 

You are a Class Member if you got a RAL through an H R Block office between 2000 and
2005 and live in one of the following jurisdictions:

Arkansas, Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Indiana,
Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Nevada,
Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington or Wisconsin.

You are also a Class Member if you live in one of the following states and got a RAL through
an H R Block office during the specified years:

Alabama   June 13, 1989 through 1996

by June 30, 2006. 

What Are Your Other Options? 

If
you decide to remain a member of the settlement class but do not submit a claim form,
you will not receive any money from the settlement  but you will still be entitled to pursue an
individual claim against Block in an arbitration forum for a period of one year. If you don t want
to be legally bound by the settlement, you must exclude yourself by May 1, 2006, or you won t be
able to sue, or continue to sue, H R Block about the legal claims in this case in any forum. If
you exclude yourself, you can t get money from this settlement. If you stay in the settlement, you
may object to it by May 1, 2006. The detailed notice explains how to exclude yourself or object.
The Court will hold a hearing in this case on  day/date/2006,  to consider whether to approve the
settlement and a request by the eight law firms representing the different Class Members for an
award of attorneys  fees and costs for investigating the facts, litigating the case, and
negotiating the settlement. You may ask to appear at the hearing, but you don t have to. For more
information, call the Settlement Administrator toll free at 1-800-000-0000, visit the website

1. Why Did I Get This Notice? 

You got at least one Refund Anticipation Loan ( RAL ) through an H R Block office between
January 1,1994 and December 23, 2005. You received this notice to inform you about
settlement of a class action lawsuit that may affect your rights. This notice provides
information about all of your options, so that you can evaluate those options before the
Court decides whether to approve the settlement. Those options include making a claim for
money from the settlement (see Questions 7-9), excluding yourself from the settlement
(Questions 11   12) or raising concerns about the fairness of the settlement (Question 16).
This package explains the lawsuit, the settlement, your legal rights, what benefits are
available, who is eligible for them, and how to get them. The Court in charge of the case
is the Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia ( the Court ).

2. What Is This Lawsuit About? 

This case combines several lawsuits that were filed against H R Block, Inc. and various
related corporations. For simplicity, the H  R Block defendants are referred to throughout
the rest of this notice as simply  Block.  The cases were filed against Block in different
parts of the country at different times, but all essentially make the same claim   that
Block violated particular state laws in the way it made RALs available. The lawyers in
these cases have filed with the Court an Amended and Consolidated Class Action Complaint
(called the  Consolidated Action  from here on), which brings together all of the claims
made in these cases. One of the principal claims the Consolidated Action makes is that
Block violated the Credit Services Organization Acts of the affected jurisdictions, or
violated similar laws.

Block denies that it violated any laws, did anything wrong, or that anyone was harmed by
its conduct. Block nevertheless has agreed to settle the Consolidated Action solely to
avoid the burden, expense, risk and uncertainty of continuing the various lawsuits.

Block and the plaintiffs in the Consolidated Actions have reached agreement on a Settlement
of the claims in the Consolidated Action including claims that had been pending previously
in Ohio, Maryland, and Alabama. The Settlement, if approved, would resolve all litigation
involving RALs which Block sold in West Virginia between January 1,1994 and December 23,
2005. Other cases are also being settled at the same time, in the same settlement
agreement, covering legal rights of individuals in a number of other jurisdictions.

3. Why Is This A Class Action? 

In a class action, one or more people called Class Representatives (in this case Deadra D. Cummins,
Ivan Bell and LaDonna Bell), sue on behalf of people who have similar claims. All these people are
a Class or Class Members. One court resolves the issues for all Class Members, except for those who
exclude themselves from the Class. Circuit Court Judge Louis Bloom is in charge of this class
action.

4. Why Is There A Settlement? 

The Court did not decide in favor of Block or any of the Plaintiffs in the various lawsuits. The
Plaintiffs in those lawsuits think they could have won if they went to trial. Block thinks the
Plaintiffs would have lost. In fact, in most cases, Block thinks that the Plaintiffs would not have
even been able to continue their cases in court, because Block s RAL contract required them to try
their claims before an arbitrator. But there was no trial and no arbitration. Instead, both sides
agreed to a settlement. This avoids the cost of a trial, and the people affected have an
opportunity to be paid. The Class Representatives and the attorneys think the settlement is best
for all Class Members.

5. How Do I Know If I Am Part Of The Settlement? 

You received this notice because records identified you as a  Cummins  class member. That means that
you fit the description of the class which the Court certified for this settlement. The Court
decided that everyone who fits this description is a Class Member:

All West Virginia residents who applied for and obtained a RAL through any medium, by any name,
advertised, marketed, offered or made by or through any lender through any office operating under
the trade name of  H R Block  (including franchise or sub-franchise offices of any Settling
Defendant or Affiliate, or any H R Block offices such as in Sears stores) from January 1,1994
through December 23, 2005, who did not previously request exclusion from the  Cummins  class, other
than those persons who previously requested exclusion from the  Cummins  class, subsequently obtained
a RAL through any Settling Defendant or Affiliate in 2005.

There are three other classes that are part of the overall Settlement. The following classes are
composed of people who live in one of the following jurisdictions and got a RAL through an H R
Block office during the specified years:

a.) The  Becker  Class (Ohio residents)   January 1,2000 to December 23, 2005;

b.) The
 Mitchell/Green  Class (residents of Maryland and Alabama)
  Maryland   January 1,1992 to May
19, 2000, excluding those people who obtained RALs

after 1996
whose RAL application contains an arbitration clause; Alabama -
June 13, 1989 through
December 31, 1996;

c.) The
 State Law  Class (residents of 22 states and the District of Columbia) - January 1, 2000
through December 23, 2005: Arkansas, Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois,
Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire,
Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington
or Wisconsin.

6. What Does The Settlement Provide? 

Block has agreed to provide additional information to customers who obtain RALs and to pay a
total of $62.5 million, plus costs of notice estimated at $4 million, to settle this case. The
total Block will pay is called the  common fund. 

You are a member of the  Cummins  class.  Cummins  class members are entitled to $32.5 million of the
$62.5 million, before deductions for the pro rata portion of administration costs, attorney s fees
and expenses relating to the  Cummins  Class, and service fees paid to the class representatives,
Deadra D. Cummins, Ivan Bell and LaDonna Bell. The State Law class will divide more than $22.5
million; the Becker class will divide more than $5.8 million; and the  Mitchell/Green  (Maryland and
Alabama) class will divide over $1.6 million; all before the same deductions are made for
administration costs, attorney s fees and expenses, and service fees applicable to each class.

Members of the different classes who submit claims will receive different amounts because each of
these cases is at a different stage of proceedings, holds different risks and different chances of
success. Each class settlement was negotiated based upon these differences. The four classes are
represented independently.

7. How Much Will My Payments Be? 

In order to receive any payment, you must return a claim form (see Question 8 and the attached
claim form). Every Class Member who returns a valid claim form will receive at least some
distribution from the common fund. Your share of the fund will depend on the number of valid claim
forms that  Cummins  Class Members send in and how many RALs you had. If every class member submitted
a claim, your share of the common fund would be a minimum of $60.90 for each RAL you obtained
during the class period. However, only a percentage of class members will actually submit claim
forms. For example, if one of every two class members return claim forms, your share of the fund
would be $121.80 for each RAL you obtained ($60.90 times two). Please remember that this is only an
example; the amount you receive from the settlement could be greater or smaller. Your share will be
reduced by whatever percentage of the common fund is taken up with administration costs, attorney s
fees, expenses, and service payments. It is unlikely that such costs will exceed 35%, but they

could be higher or lower. The maximum amount any class member can receive is $175 for each RAL
obtained during the class period.

8. How Can I Get A Payment? 

To qualify for payment, you must send in a complete and valid claim form.  A claim form is attached
to this Notice . You may also get a claim form from the Settlement Administrator s website
  www.INSERTWEBADDRESS.com  . Read the instructions carefully, fill out the form, include all the
information the form asks for, sign it, and mail it so that it is postmarked no later than  June
30, 2006 . You may also email the claim form to the Settlement Administrator at   claims @
INSERTWEBADDRESS.com . If you email the claim form, you must do so no later than midnight on  June
30, 2006. 

9. When Would I Get My Payment? 

The Court will hold a hearing at  time/date/month/2006  at  the Kanawha County Judicial Annex, 111
Court Street, Charleston, West Virginia 25301 , to decide whether to approve the settlement. If the
Court approves the settlement after that, there may be appeals. It s always uncertain whether these
appeals can be resolved, and resolving them can take time, perhaps more than a year. The settlement
administrator will keep the settlement website at  www.INSERTWEBADDRESS.com  updated so that
everyone who is in the class may keep informed of the progress of the settlement. Please be
patient. Note: It is unlikely that you will receive your payment until six months or more after the
date you send in a claim form.

10. Am I Giving Up Anything To Get A Payment Or Stay In The Class? 

Unless you exclude yourself, also called  opting out  (see Question 12), you will be considered a
member of the class, which means that you can t sue, continue to sue, or be part of any other
lawsuit against Block about the legal issues in this case. Giving up your claims is called a
 release.  Unless you exclude yourself from the settlement, you will release your claims whether or
not you submit a claim form and receive payment.

However, certain claims are not released even if you stay in the class. All claims made in other
currently existing class actions that relate to the RAL or other products and services offered by
Block are not released. Claims under state law based solely on allegations that a tax preparer
failed (A) to properly prepare a tax return or (B) to maintain the confidentiality of taxpayer
information resulting in injury based on  stolen identity  or similar misuse of taxpayer
information or theft of a RAL check; and claims to enforce the terms and conditions of the
Settlement Agreement, are similarly not released.

Class members who do not exclude themselves, but do not make a claim for money from this settlement
may choose to arbitrate their individual claims

against Block for another year after the settlement is finalized. Although Class Counsel recommend
this settlement, they take no position on your likelihood of succeeding on an individual basis in
an arbitration case. You should obtain independent legal help if you need more information about
the economic value of the arbitration alternative to excluding yourself or making a claim for money
under the settlement.

The settlement requires Block to follow certain business practices with future RALs, and provides
Block with an incentive to register as a Credit Service Organization ( CSO ) in the jurisdictions
covered by the settlement. Block has two years to decide whether to register and come into
compliance with the various CSO statutes.

Important:   If  you decide to go back to Block to obtain a RAL during the two-year period Block has
to register as a CSO in the various jurisdictions,  and  Block does register and comply with your
jurisdiction s CSO statute in that two-year period, then  you will not be able to sue Block for any
new RAL violation that you claim happened during the two-year period.  But,  if Block does not
register  as a CSO  and comply  with the CSO statute in your jurisdiction, you will be able to sue
based on any new RAL violation that you claimed happened during that period. In addition, any
deadline on when you can sue Block (called the  statute of limitations ) will be suspended for the
two-year period.

11. Can I Exclude Myself From The Settlement (Sometimes Called  Opting Out )? 

Yes, you may  opt out  and exclude yourself from the Settlement Class. If you opt out, you will not
receive any payment from the common fund, you will not release any claims you may have against
Block, and you will not be bound by anything that happens in the Consolidated Action. If you opt
out, you will be free to pursue whatever legal rights you may have by pursuing your own lawsuit
against Block at your own risk and expense.

12. What Do I Do If I Want To Exclude Myself? 

In order to opt out and exclude yourself from the Settlement Class, you must mail a  Request for
Exclusion  to the Settlement Administrator at  address . Your Request for Exclusion must be in
writing and must be postmarked no later than May 1, 2006. To be effective, a Request for Exclusion
must contain: (a) the name of this case  (Cummins, v. H R Block, Inc.);  (b) your name, address,
social security number and telephone number; (c) a statement that you want to opt out of the
lawsuit; and (d) your signature. If the Request for Exclusion is not postmarked by the deadline,
you will be included automatically in the Settlement Class and you may be eligible to receive
Settlement payments as summarized above. Even if you do not file a claim, you will be legally bound
by the proposed Settlement, including provisions releasing Block.

13. When And Where Will The Court Decide Whether To Approve The
Settlement? 

The Court will hold a Fairness Hearing on  time/date/at the Kanawha County Judicial Annex, 111 Court
Street, Charleston, West Virginia 25301 . At this
hearing the Court will consider whether the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. If there
are objections, the Court will consider them. The Court will listen to people who have asked to
speak at the hearing. The Court may also decide how much to pay to Class Counsel. After the
hearing, the Court will decide whether to approve the settlement. We do not know how long these
decisions will take. The hearing can be continued at any time by the Court without any further
notice to you.

14. Do I Have To Come To The Hearing? 

No. You are not required to attend the hearing. But you are welcome to come at your own expense. If
you wish to speak, you may ask the Court for permission to speak at the Fairness Hearing. To do so,
you must send a letter saying that it is your  Notice of Intention to Appear in  Cummins v. H R
Block.   Be sure to include your name, address, telephone number, and your signature. Your Notice of
Intention to Appear must be received no later than  May 1, 2006 , and be sent to the Clerk of the
Court, Class Counsel, and Defense Counsel, at the addresses in Question 16. You cannot speak at the
hearing if you excluded yourself, because once you exclude yourself, the settlement does not affect
your rights.

15. What If I Do Nothing? 

If you do nothing, you ll get no money from this settlement. But, unless you exclude yourself, you
won t be able to start a lawsuit, continue with a lawsuit, or be part of any other lawsuit against
Block about the legal issues in this case. You would, however, be able to arbitrate your claims
against Block for another year, as described in Question 10.

16. What If I Want To Object To The Settlement? 

If you re a Class Member who has not requested exclusion, you can object to the settlement if you
don t like it. If you wish to object, you must write a letter stating your objections, the specific
reasons for each objection (including any legal support you want to bring to the Court s attention)
and a description of any evidence you wish to introduce in support of your objections. You must
include your name, address, telephone number and your signature. Also include the name and number
of this action  (Cummins v. H  R Block, Inc.,  Civil Action No. 03-C-134). Your letter must be
received in these four different places no later than  May 1, 2006: 

(i) Coordinating Counsel:

Brian A.Glasser, Esq.

Bailey   Glasser, LLP 
227 Capitol Street 
Charleston, WV 25301

(iii) The Court:

Clerk of Court 
Kanawha County Circuit Court 
111 Court Street 
Charleston, WV 25301

17. What Is The Difference Between Excluding Myself And Objecting? 

Excluding yourself is telling the Court that you don t want to be part of the Class. If you
exclude yourself, you have no basis to object because the case no longer affects you. Objecting is
telling the Court that you don t like something about the settlement and you don t want the Court
to approve it. You can object only if you stay in the Class.

18.
Who Are The Lawyers For The  Cummins  Class? 

The Court has appointed the following law firm to represent you and other  Cummins  Class Members.
These lawyers are called Class Counsel. If you want to be represented by your own lawyer, you may
hire one at your own expense.

Brian A. Glasser 
H.F. Salsbery 
John W. Barrett 
Eric B. Snyder 
Bailey   Glasser LLP 
227 Capitol Street 
Charleston, WV 25301

19. How Will Class Counsel s Fees And Expenses Be Paid? 

Class Counsel will make an application to the Court for approval of an award of attorneys  fees and
expenses in an amount not more than one-third of the portion of the common fund attributable to the
 Cummins  Class. The fees would pay Class Counsel for investigating the facts, litigating the case,
and negotiating

the settlement. The Court will determine the amount of any fees and expenses awarded to
Class Counsel.

20. Does The Class Representative Get Additional Compensation? 

Subject to Court approval, the named plaintiffs in the five cases which make up the Consolidated
Action will seek  service awards  for their active participation in this litigation. Any such
 service award  will be paid from the portions of the common fund attributable to the cases those
plaintiffs brought. The  Cummins  class representatives will seek a service award in an amount to be
determined by the Court.

21. What If The Court Does Not Approve The Settlement? 

If the Court does not approve the proposed Settlement as being fair, adequate and reasonable,
the Settlement Agreement will be null and void, and all parties will be returned to their
respective pre-Settlement status in the various lawsuits that the proposed Settlement hopes to
resolve.

22. Where Do I Get Additional Information? 

This notice summarizes the proposed settlement. You can find answers to common questions about the
settlement, plus other helpful information at the Settlement Administrator s website
 www.INSERTWEBADDRESS.com . You can also get a copy of the Settlement Agreement from the website,

22. Where Do I Get Additional
Information? 

1. Why Did I Get This Notice? 

You got at least one Refund Anticipation Loan ( RAL ) through an H R Block office between
January 1, 2000 and December 23, 2005. You received this notice to inform you about
settlement of a class action lawsuit that may affect your rights. This notice provides
information about all of your options, so that you can evaluate those options before the
Court decides whether to approve the settlement. Those options include making a claim for
money from the settlement (see Questions 7-9), excluding yourself from the settlement
(Questions 11   12) or raising concerns about the fairness of the settlement (Question 16).
This package explains the lawsuit, the settlement, your legal rights, what benefits are
available, who is eligible for them, and how to get them. The Court in charge of the case
is the Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia ( the Court ).

2. What Is This Lawsuit About? 

This case combines several lawsuits that were filed against H R Block, Inc. and various
related corporations. For simplicity, the H  R Block defendants are referred to throughout
the rest of this notice as simply  Block.  The cases were filed against Block in different
parts of the country at different times, but all essentially make the
same claim   that
Block violated particular state laws in the way it made RALs available. The lawyers in
these cases have filed with the Court an Amended and Consolidated Class Action Complaint
(called the  Consolidated Action  from here on), which brings together all of the claims
made in these cases. One of the principal claims the Consolidated Action makes is that
Block violated the Credit Services Organization Acts of the affected jurisdictions, or
violated similar laws.

Block denies that it violated any laws, did anything wrong, or that anyone was harmed by its
conduct. Block nevertheless has agreed to settle the Consolidated Action solely to avoid the
burden, expense, risk and uncertainty of continuing the various lawsuits.

Block and the plaintiffs in the Consolidated Actions have reached agreement on a Settlement
of the claims in the Consolidated Action including claims that had been pending previously
in Ohio, Maryland, and Alabama. The Settlement, if approved, would resolve all litigation
involving RALs which Block sold in Ohio between January 1, 2000
and December 23, 2005. Other
cases are also being settled at the same time, in the same settlement agreement, covering
legal rights of individuals in a number of other jurisdictions.

3. Why Is This A Class Action? 

In a class action, one or more people called Class Representatives (in this case Lynn Becker), sue
on behalf of people who have similar claims. All these people are a Class or Class Members. One
court resolves the issues for all Class Members, except for those who exclude themselves from the
Class. Circuit Court Judge Louis Bloom is in charge of this class action.

4. Why Is There A Settlement? 

The Court did not decide in favor of Block or any of the Plaintiffs in the various lawsuits. The
Plaintiffs in those lawsuits think they could have won if they went to trial. Block thinks the
Plaintiffs would have lost. In fact, in most cases, Block thinks that the Plaintiffs would not have
even been able to continue their cases in court, because Block s RAL contract required them to try
their claims before an arbitrator. But there was no trial and no arbitration. Instead, both sides
agreed to a settlement. This avoids the cost of a trial, and the people affected have an
opportunity to be paid. The Class Representative and the attorneys think the settlement is best for
all Class Members.

5. How Do I Know If I Am Part Of The Settlement? 

You received this notice because records identified you as a  Becker  class member. That means that
you fit the description of the class which the Court certified for this settlement. The Court
decided that everyone who fits this description is a Class Member:

All Ohio residents who applied for and obtained a RAL through any medium, by any name, advertised,
marketed, offered or made by or through any lender through any office operating under the trade
name of  H R Block  (including franchise or sub-franchise offices of any Settling Defendant or
Affiliate, as defined herein, or any H R Block offices such as in Sears stores) from January 1,
2000 through December 23, 2005.

There are three other classes that are part of the overall Settlement. The following classes are
composed of people who live in one of the following jurisdictions and got a RAL through an H R
Block office during the specified years:

a.) The  Cummins  Class (West Virginia residents)   January 1, 1994 to December 23, 2005;

b.) The  Mitchell/Green  Class (residents of Maryland and Alabama)   Maryland   January 1, 1992 to May
19, 2000, excluding those people who obtained RALs after 1996 whose RAL application contains an
arbitration clause; Alabama   June 13, 1989 through December 31, 1996;

c.) The  State Law  Class (residents of 22 states and the District of Columbia)   January 1, 2000
through December 23, 2005: Arkansas, Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois,
Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire,
Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington or Wisconsin.

6. What Does The Settlement Provide? 

Block has agreed to provide additional information to customers who obtain RALs and to pay a total
of $62.5 million, plus costs of notice estimated at $4 million, to settle this case. The total
Block will pay is called the  common fund. 

You are a member of the  Becker  class.  Becker  class members are entitled to more than $5.8 million
of the $62.5 million, before deductions for the pro rata portion of administration costs,
attorney s fees and expenses relating to the  Becker  Class, and service fees paid to the class
representative, Lynn Becker. The  Cummins  class members will divide $32.5 million; the State Law
class will divide more than $22.5 million; and the  Mitchell/Green  (Maryland and Alabama) class will
divide more than $1.6 million; all before the same deductions are made for administration costs,
attorney s fees and expenses, and service fees applicable to each class.

Members of the different classes who submit claims will receive different amounts because each of
these cases is at a different stage of proceedings, holds different risks and different chances of
success. Each class settlement was negotiated based upon these differences. The four classes are
represented independently.

7. How Much Will My Payments Be? 

In order to receive any payment, you must return a claim form (see Question 8 and the attached
claim form). Every Class Member who returns a valid claim form will receive at least some
distribution from the common fund. Your share of the fund will depend on the number of valid claim
forms that  Becker  Class Members send in and how many RALs you had. If every class member submitted
a claim, your share of the common fund would be a minimum of $3.66 for each RAL you obtained during
the class period. However, only a percentage of class members will actually submit claim forms.
For example, if only one of every four class members return claim forms, your share of the fund
would be $14.64 for each RAL you obtained ($3.66 times four). Your share will be reduced by
whatever percentage of the common fund is taken up with administration costs, attorney s fees,
expenses, and service payments. It is unlikely that such costs will exceed 30%, but they could be
higher or lower. Please remember that this is only an example; the amount you receive from the
settlement could be greater or smaller.

8. How Can I Get A Payment? 

To qualify for payment, you must send in a complete and valid claim form.  A claim form is attached
to this Notice.  You may also get a claim form from the Settlement Administrator s website
  www.INSERTWEBADDRESS.com  . Read the instructions carefully, fill out the form, include all the
information the form asks for, sign it, and mail it so that it is postmarked no later than  June 30,
2006.  You may also email the claim form to the Settlement Administrator at  claims@
INSERTWEBADDRESS.com . If you email the claim form, you must do so no later than midnight on  June
30, 2006. 

9. When Would I Get My Payment? 

The Court will hold a hearing at  time/date/month/2006 at the Kanawha County Judicial Annex, 111
Court Street, Charleston, West Virginia 25301,  to decide whether to approve the settlement. If the
Court approves the settlement after that, there may be appeals. It s always uncertain whether these
appeals can be resolved, and resolving them can take time, perhaps more than a year. The settlement
administrator will keep the settlement website at  www.INSERTWEBADDRESS.com  updated so that
everyone who is in the class may keep informed of the progress of the settlement. Please be
patient. Note: It is unlikely that you will receive your payment until six months or more after the
date you send in a claim form.

10. Am I Giving Up Anything To Get A Payment Or Stay In The Class? 

Unless you exclude yourself, also called  opting out  (see Question 12), you will be considered a
member of the class, which means that you can t sue, continue to sue, or be part of any other
lawsuit against Block about the legal issues in this case. Giving up your claims is called a
 release.  Unless you exclude yourself from the settlement, you will release your claims whether or
not you submit a claim form and receive payment.

However, certain claims are not released even if you stay in the class. All claims made in other
currently existing class actions that relate to the RAL or other products and services offered by
Block are not released. Claims under state law based solely on allegations that a tax preparer
failed (A) to properly prepare a tax return or (B) to maintain the confidentiality of taxpayer
information resulting in injury based on  stolen identity  or similar misuse of taxpayer
information or theft of a RAL check; and claims to enforce the terms and conditions of the
Settlement Agreement, are similarly not released.

Class members who do not exclude themselves, but do not make a claim for money from this settlement
may choose to arbitrate their individual claims against Block for another year after the settlement
is finalized. Although Class Counsel recommend this settlement, they take no position on your
likelihood of succeeding on an individual basis in an arbitration case. You should obtain

independent legal help if you need more information about the economic value of the arbitration
alternative to excluding yourself or making a claim for money under the settlement.

The settlement requires Block to follow certain business practices with future RALs, and provides
Block with an incentive to register as a Credit Service Organization ( CSO ) in the jurisdictions
covered by the settlement. Block has two years to decide whether to register and come into
compliance with the various CSO statutes.

Important:   If  you decide to go back to Block to obtain a RAL during the two-year period Block has
to register as a CSO in the various jurisdictions,  and  Block does register and comply with your
jurisdiction s CSO statute in that two-year period, then  you will not be able to sue Block for any
new RAL violation that you claim happened during the two-year period.  But,  if Block does not
register  as a CSO  and comply  with the CSO statute in your jurisdiction, you will be able to sue
based on any new RAL violation that you claimed happened during that period. In addition, any
deadline on when you can sue Block (called the  statute of limitations ) will be suspended for the
two-year period.

11. Can I Exclude Myself From The Settlement (Sometimes Called  Opting Out )? 

Yes, you may  opt out  and exclude yourself from the Settlement Class. If you opt out, you will not
receive any payment from the common fund, you will not release any claims you may have against
Block, and you will not be bound by anything that happens in the Consolidated Action. If you opt
out, you will be free to pursue whatever legal rights you may have by pursuing your own lawsuit
against Block at your own risk and expense.

12. What Do I Do If I Want To Exclude Myself? 

In order to opt out and exclude yourself from the Settlement Class, you must mail a  Request for
Exclusion  to the Settlement Administrator at  address . Your Request for Exclusion must be in
writing and must be postmarked no later than May 1, 2006. To be effective, a Request for Exclusion
must contain: (a) the name of this case  (Cummins, v. H   R Block, Inc.);  (b) your name, address,
social security number and telephone number; (c) a statement that you want to opt out of the
lawsuit; and (d) your signature. If the Request for Exclusion is not postmarked by the deadline,
you will be included automatically in the Settlement Class and you may be eligible to receive
Settlement payments as summarized above. Even if you do not file a claim, you will be legally bound
by the proposed Settlement, including provisions releasing Block.

13. When And Where Will The Court Decide Whether To Approve The 
Settlement? 

The Court will hold a Fairness Hearing on  time/date/ at the Kanawha County Judicial Annex, 111
Court Street, Charleston, West Virginia 25301.  At this hearing the Court will consider whether the
settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. If there are objections, the Court will consider
them. The Court will listen to people who have asked to speak at the hearing. The Court may also
decide how much to pay to Class Counsel. After the hearing, the Court will decide whether to
approve the settlement. We do not know now long these decisions will take. The hearing can be
continued at any time by the Court without any further notice to you.

14. Do I Have To Come To The Hearing? 

No. You are not required to attend the hearing. But you are welcome to come at your own expense. If
you wish to speak, you may ask the Court for permission to speak at the Fairness Hearing. To do so,
you must send a letter saying that it is your  Notice of Intention to Appear in  Cummins v. H R
Block.   Be sure to include your name, address, telephone number, and your signature. Your Notice of
Intention to Appear must be received no later than  May 1, 2006,  and be sent to the Clerk of the
Court, Class Counsel, and Defense Counsel, at the addresses in Question 16. You cannot speak at the
hearing if you excluded yourself, because once you exclude yourself, the settlement does not affect
your rights.

15. What If I Do Nothing? 

If you do nothing, you ll get no money from this settlement. But, unless you exclude yourself, you
won t be able to start a lawsuit, continue with a lawsuit, or be part of any other lawsuit against
Block about the legal issues in this case. You would, however, be able to arbitrate your claims
against Block for another year, as described in Question 10.

16. What If I Want To Object To The Settlement? 

If you re a Class Member who has not requested exclusion, you can object to the settlement if you
don t like it. If you wish to object, you must write a letter stating your objections, the specific
reasons for each objection (including any legal support you want to bring to the Court s attention)
and a description of any evidence you wish to introduce in support of your objections. You must
include your name, address, telephone number and your signature. Also include the name and number
of this action  (Cummins v. H   R Block, Inc.,  Civil Action No. 03-C-134). Your letter must be
received in these four different places no later than  May 1, 2006: 

(i) Coordinating Counsel:

Brian A.Glasser, Esq.

Bailey   Glasser, LLP 
227 Capitol Street 
Charleston, WV 25301

(iii) The Court:

Clerk of Court 
Kanawha County Circuit Court 
111 Court Street 
Charleston, WV 25301

17. What Is The Difference Between Excluding Myself And Objecting? 

Excluding yourself is telling the Court that you don t want to be part of the Class. If you exclude
yourself, you have no basis to object because the case no longer affects you. Objecting is telling
the Court that you don t like something about the settlement and you don t want the Court to
approve it. You can object only if you stay in the Class.

18. Who Are The Lawyers For The  Becker  Class? 

The Court has appointed the following law firms to represent you and other  Becker  Class Members.
These lawyers are called Class Counsel. If you want to be represented by your own lawyer, you may
hire one at your own expense.

19. How Will Class Counsel s Fees And Expenses Be Paid? 

Class Counsel will make an application to the Court for approval of an award of attorneys  fees and
expenses in an amount not more than 25% of the portion of the common fund attributable to the
 Becker  Class. The fees would pay Class Counsel for investigating the facts, litigating the case,
and negotiating the

settlement. The Court will determine the amount of any fees and  expenses  awarded to Class
Counsel.

20. Does The Class Representative Get Additional Compensation? 

Subject to Court approval, the named plaintiffs in the five cases which make up the Consolidated
Action will seek  service awards  for their active participation in this litigation. Any such
 service award  will be paid from the portions of the common fund attributable to the cases those
plaintiffs brought. Lynn Becker will seek a  service award  of $5,000. The Court will determine
whether Ms. Becker receives a  service award  and the amount of that award.

21. What If The Court Does Not Approve The Settlement? 

If the Court does not approve the proposed Settlement as being fair, adequate and reasonable,
the Settlement Agreement will be null and void, and all parties will be returned to their
respective pre-Settlement status in the various lawsuits that the proposed Settlement hopes to
resolve.

22. Where Do I Get Additional Information? 

This notice summarizes the proposed settlement. You can find answers to common questions about the
settlement, plus other helpful information at the Settlement Administrator s website
 www.INSERTWEBADDRESS.com . You can also get a copy of the Settlement Agreement from the website,
or by writing to the Settlement Administrator at ####. If you cannot get the information you need
from this notice or from the Settlement Administrator, you may contact  Becker  Class Counsel.

Please    Do     Not    Contact The Court Or Block For Information.

-1-

1. Why Did I Get This Notice? 

You got at least one Refund Anticipation Loan ( RAL ) through an H R Block office in
Maryland between January 1, 1992 and December 31, 1996, or through an H R Block office in
Alabama between June 13, 1989 and December 31, 1996. You received this notice to inform you
about settlement of a class action lawsuit that may affect your rights. This notice
provides information about all of your options, so that you can evaluate those options
before the Court decides whether to approve the settlement. Those options include making a
claim for money from the settlement (see Questions 7-9), excluding yourself from the
settlement (Questions 11   12) or raising concerns about the fairness of the settlement
(Question 16). This package explains the lawsuit, the settlement, your legal rights, what
benefits are available, who is eligible for them, and how to get them. The Court in charge
of the case is the Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia ( the Court ).

2. What Is This Lawsuit About? 

This case combines several lawsuits that were filed against H R Block, Inc. and various
related corporations. For simplicity, the H  R Block defendants are referred to throughout
the rest of this notice as simply  Block.  The cases were filed against Block in different
parts of the country at different times, but all essentially make the same claim   that
Block violated particular state laws in the way it made RALs available. The lawyers in
these cases have filed with the Court an Amended and Consolidated Class Action Complaint
(called the  Consolidated Action  from here on), which brings together all of the claims
made in these cases. One of the principal claims the Consolidated Action makes is that
Block violated the Credit Services Organization Acts of the affected jurisdictions, or
violated similar laws.

Block denies that it violated any laws, did anything wrong, or that anyone was harmed by
its conduct. Block nevertheless has agreed to settle the Consolidated Action solely to
avoid the burden, expense, risk and uncertainty of continuing the various lawsuits.

Block and the plaintiffs in the Consolidated Actions have reached agreement on a
Settlement of the claims in the Consolidated Action including claims that had been pending
previously in Ohio, Maryland, and Alabama. The Settlement, if approved, would resolve all
litigation involving RALs which Block sold in Alabama between
June 13, 1989 and December
31, 1996, and in Maryland between January 1, 1992 and
December 31, 1996. Other cases are also
being settled at

the same time, in the same settlement agreement, covering legal rights of individuals
in a number of other jurisdictions.

3. Why Is This A Class Action? 

In a class action, one or more people called Class Representatives (in this case Levon Mitchell
and Geral Mitchell of Alabama, and Joyce A. Green of Maryland) sue on behalf of people who have
similar claims. All these people are a Class or Class Members. One court resolves the issues for
all Class Members, except for those who exclude themselves from the Class. Circuit Court Judge
Louis Bloom is in charge of this class action.

4. Why Is There A Settlement? 

The Court did not decide in favor of Block or any of the Plaintiffs in the various lawsuits. The
Plaintiffs in those lawsuits think they could have won if they went to trial. Block thinks the
Plaintiffs would have lost. In fact, in most cases, Block thinks that the Plaintiffs would not have
even been able to continue their cases in court, because Block s RAL contract required them to try
their claims before an arbitrator. But there was no trial and no arbitration. Instead, both sides
agreed to a settlement. This avoids the cost of a trial, and the people affected have an
opportunity to be paid. The Class Representatives and the attorneys think the settlement is best
for all Class Members.

5. How Do I Know If I Am Part Of The Settlement? 

You received this notice because records identified you as a  Mitchell/Green  class member. That
means that you fit the description of the class which the Court certified for this settlement. The
Court decided that everyone who fits this description is a Class Member:

All Maryland residents who applied for and obtained a RAL at any H R Block office in Maryland from
January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1996 and did not thereafter apply for and obtain a RAL subject
to an arbitration provision, and all individuals who obtained a RAL
from June 13, 1989 through
December 31, 1996 through any  H R Block  office in Alabama for which the Settling Defendants herein
received a license fee payment or portion of the finance charge, and who did not previously request
exclusion from their respective classes that were previously certified or timely request exclusion
from this class.

There are three other classes that are part of the overall Settlement. The following classes are
composed of people who live in one of the following jurisdictions and got a RAL through an H R
Block office during the specified years:

a.) The
 Cummins  Class (West Virginia residents)   January 1, 1994 to December 23, 2005;

b.) The
 Becker  Class (residents of Ohio)   January 1, 2000 to December 23, 2005

c.) The
State Law Class (residents of 22 states and the District of Columbia)
 January 1, 2000
through December 23, 2005: Arkansas, Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois,
Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire,
Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington or Wisconsin.

6. What Does The Settlement Provide? 

Block has agreed to provide additional information to customers who obtain RALs and to pay a total
of $62.5 million, plus costs of notice estimated at $4 million, to settle this case. The total
Block will pay is called the  common fund. 

You are a member of the  Mitchell/Green  class.  Mitchell/Green  class members are entitled to over
$1.6 million of the $62.5 million, before deductions for the pro rata portion of administration
costs, attorney s fees and expenses relating to the  Mitchell/Green  class, and service fees paid to
the class representatives, Joyce A. Green, Levon Mitchell and Geral Mitchell. The  Cummins  class
members will divide $32.5 million; the State Law class will divide more than $22.5 million; and the
 Becker  class will divide more than $5.8 million; all before the same deductions are made for
administration costs, attorney s fees and expenses, and service fees applicable to each class.

Members of the different classes who submit claims will receive different amounts because each of
these cases is at a different stage of proceedings, holds different risks and different chances of
success. Each class settlement was negotiated based upon these differences. The four classes are
represented independently.

7. How Much Will My Payments Be? 

In order to receive any payment, you must return a claim form (see Question 8 and the attached
claim form). Every Class Member who returns a valid claim form will receive at least some
distribution from the common fund. Your share of the fund will depend on the number of valid claim
forms that  Mitchell/Green  Class Members send in and how many RALs you had. If every class member
submitted a claim, your share of the common fund would be a minimum of $3.66 for each RAL you
obtained during the class period. However, only a percentage of class members will actually
submit claim forms. For example, if only one of every four class members return claim forms, your
share of the fund would be $14.64 for each RAL you obtained ($3.66 times four). Your share will be
reduced by whatever percentage of the common fund is taken up with administration costs, attorney s
fees, expenses, and service payments. It is unlikely that such costs will exceed 30%, but they
could be higher or lower. Please remember that

this is only an example; the amount you receive from the settlement could be greater or smaller.

8. How Can I Get A Payment? 

To qualify for payment, you must send in a complete and valid claim form.  A claim form is
attached to this Notice.  You may also get a claim form from the Settlement Administrator s website
  www.INSERTWEBADDRESS.com  . Read the instructions carefully, fill out the form, include all the
information the form asks for, sign it, and mail it so that it is
postmarked no later than  June 30, 2006.  You may also email the claim form to the Settlement
Administrator at  claims @ INSERTWEBADDRESS.com . If you email the claim form, you must do so no later than midnight on  June
30, 2006. 

9. When Would I Get My Payment? 

The Court will hold a hearing at  time/date/month/2006 at the Kanawha County Judicial Annex,
111 Court Street, Charleston, West Virginia 25301,  to decide whether to approve the settlement. If
the Court approves the settlement after that, there may be appeals. It s always uncertain whether
these appeals can be resolved, and resolving them can take time, perhaps more than a year. The
settlement administrator will keep the settlement website at  www.INSERTWEBADDRESS.com  updated so
that everyone who is in the class may keep informed of the progress of the settlement. Please be
patient. Note: It is unlikely that you will receive your payment until six months or more after the
date you send in a claim form.

10. Am I Giving Up Anything To Get A Payment Or Stay In The Class? 

Unless you exclude yourself, also called  opting out  (see Question 12), you will be
considered a member of the class, which means that you can t sue, continue to sue, or be part of
any other lawsuit against Block about the legal issues in this case. Giving up your claims is
called a  release.  Unless you exclude yourself from the settlement, you will release your claims
whether or not you submit a claim form and receive payment.

However, certain claims are not released even if you stay in the class. All claims made in other
currently existing class actions that relate to the RAL or other products and services offered by
Block are not released. Claims under state law based solely on allegations that a tax prepare
failed (A) to properly prepare a tax return or (B) to maintain the confidentiality of taxpayer
information resulting in injury based on  stolen identity  or similar misuse of taxpayer
information or theft of  a  RAL check; and claims to enforce the terms and conditions of the
Settlement Agreement, are similarly not released.

Class members who do not exclude themselves, but do not make a claim for money from this settlement
may choose to arbitrate their individual claims

against Block for another year after the settlement is finalized. Although Class Counsel
recommend this settlement, they take no position on your likelihood of succeeding on an individual
basis in an arbitration case. You should obtain independent legal help if you need more information
about the economic value of the arbitration alternative to excluding yourself or making a claim for
money under the settlement.

The settlement requires Block to follow certain business practices with future RALs.

11. Can I Exclude Myself From The Settlement (Sometimes Called  Opting Out )? 

Yes, you may  opt out  and exclude yourself from the Settlement Class. If you opt out, you will not
receive any payment from the common fund, you will not release any claims you may have against
Block, and you will not be bound by anything that happens in the Consolidated Action. If you opt
out, you will be free to pursue whatever legal rights you may have by pursuing your own lawsuit
against Block at your own risk and expense.

12. What Do I Do If I Want To Exclude Myself? 

In order to opt out and exclude yourself from the Settlement Class, you must mail a  Request for
Exclusion  to the Settlement Administrator at  address.  Your Request for Exclusion must be in
writing and must be postmarked no later than May 1, 2006. To be effective, a Request for Exclusion
must contain: (a) the name of this case  (Cummins. v. H  
R Block, Inc.);  (b) your name, address,
social security number and telephone number; (c) a statement that you want to opt out of the
lawsuit; and (d) your signature. If the Request for Exclusion is not postmarked by the deadline,
you will be included automatically in the Settlement Class and you may be eligible to receive
Settlement payments as summarized above. Even if you do not file a claim, you will be legally bound
by the proposed Settlement, including provisions releasing Block.

13. When And Where Will The Court Decide Whether To Approve The Settlement? 

The Court will hold a Fairness Hearing on  time/date/ at the Kanawha County Judicial Annex, 111
Court Street, Charleston, West Virginia 25301.  At this hearing the Court will consider whether the
settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. If there are objections, the Court will consider
them. The Court will listen to people who have asked to speak at the hearing. The Court may also
decide how much to pay to Class Counsel. After the hearing, the Court will decide whether to
approve the settlement. We do not know how long these decisions will take. The hearing can be
continued at any time by the Court without any further notice to you.

14. Do I Have To Come To The Hearing? 

No. You are not required to attend the hearing. But you are welcome to come at your own expense. If
you wish to speak, you may ask the Court for permission to speak at the Fairness Hearing. To do so,
you must send a letter saying that it is your  Notice of
Intention to Appear in  Cummins v. H R
Block.   Be sure to include your name, address, telephone number, and your signature. Your Notice of
Intention to Appear must be received no later than  May 1, 2006,  and be sent to the Clerk of the
Court, Class Counsel, and Defense Counsel, at the addresses in Question 16. You cannot speak at the
hearing if you excluded yourself, because once you exclude yourself, the settlement does not affect
your rights.

15. What If I Do Nothing? 

If you do nothing, you ll get no money from this settlement. But, unless you exclude yourself, you
won t be able to start a lawsuit, continue with a lawsuit, or be part of any other lawsuit against
Block about the legal issues in this case. You would, however, be able to arbitrate your claims
against Block for another year, as described in Question 10.

16. What If I Want To Object To The Settlement? 

If you re a Class Member who has not requested exclusion, you can object to the settlement if you
don t like it. If you wish to object, you must write a letter stating your objections, the specific
reasons for each objection (including any legal support you want to bring to the Court s attention)
and a description of any evidence you wish to introduce in support of your objections. You must
include your name, address, telephone number and your signature. Also include the name and number
of this action  (Cummins v. H   R Block, Inc.,  Civil Action No. 03-C-134). Your letter must be
received in these four different places no later than  May 1, 2006: 

(i) Coordinating Counsel:

Brian A.Glasser, Esq. 
Bailey   Glasser, LLP 
227 Capitol Street 
Charleston, WV 25301

(ii) Defendants  Counsel:

(iii) The Court:

Clerk of Court 
Kanawha County Circuit Court 
111 Court Street 
Charleston, WV 25301

17. What Is The Difference Between Excluding Myself And Objecting? 

Excluding yourself is telling the Court that you don t want to be part of the Class. If you
exclude yourself, you have no basis to object because the case no longer affects you. Objecting
is telling the Court that you don t like something about the settlement and you don t want the
Court to approve it. You can object only if you stay in the Class.

18.
Who Are The Lawyers For The  Mitchell/Green Class?  

The Court has appointed the following law firms to represent you and other  Mitchell/Green  Class
Members. These lawyers are called Class Counsel. If you want to be represented by your own
lawyer, you may hire one at your own expense.

Steven E. Angstreich, Esq.

19. How Will Class Counsel s Fees And Expenses Be Paid? 

Class Counsel will make an application to the Court for approval of an award of attorneys 
fees and expenses in an amount not more than 25% of the portion of the common fund attributable to
the  Mitchell/Green  Class. The fees would pay Class Counsel for investigating the facts, litigating
the case, and negotiating the settlement. The Court will determine the amount of any fees and
expenses awarded to Class Counsel.

20. Does The Class Representative Get Additional Compensation? 

Subject to Court approval, the named plaintiffs in the five cases which make up the Consolidated
Action will seek  service awards  for their active participation in this litigation. Any such
 service award  will be paid from the portions of the common fund attributable to the cases those
plaintiffs brought. Joyce A. Green, Levon Mitchell and Geral Mitchell will seek a  service award 
of $5,000. The Court will determine whether they receive a  service award  and the amount of that
award.

21. What If The Court Does Not Approve The Settlement? 

If the Court does not approve the proposed Settlement as being fair, adequate and
reasonable, the Settlement Agreement will be null and void, and all parties will be returned to
their respective pre-Settlement status in the various lawsuits that the proposed Settlement
hopes to resolve.

1. Why Did I Get This Notice? 

You got at least one Refund Anticipation Loan ( RAL ) through an H R Block office between
January 1, 2000 and December 23, 2005. You received this notice to inform you about
settlement of a class action lawsuit that may affect your rights. This notice provides
information about all of your options, so that you can evaluate those options before the
Court decides whether to approve the settlement. Those options include making a claim for
money from the settlement (see Questions 7-9), excluding yourself from the settlement
(Questions 11   12) or raising concerns about the fairness of the settlement (Question
16). This package explains the lawsuit, the settlement, your legal rights, what benefits
are available, who is eligible for them, and how to get them. The Court in charge of the
case is the Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia ( the Court ).

2. What Is This Lawsuit About? 

This case combines several lawsuits that were filed against H R Block, Inc. and various
related corporations. For simplicity, the H   R Block defendants are referred to
throughout the rest of this notice as simply  Block.  The cases were filed against Block
in different parts of the country at different times, but all essentially make the same
claim   that Block violated particular state laws in the way it made RALs available. The
lawyers in these cases have filed with the Court an Amended and Consolidated Class Action
Complaint (called the  Consolidated Action  from here on), which brings together all of
the claims made in these cases. One of the principal claims the Consolidated Action makes
is that Block violated the Credit Services Organization Acts of the affected
jurisdictions, or violated similar laws.

Block denies that it violated any laws, did anything wrong, or that anyone was harmed by
its conduct. Block nevertheless has agreed to settle the Consolidated Action solely to
avoid the burden, expense, risk and uncertainty of continuing the various lawsuits.

Block and the plaintiffs in the Consolidated Actions have reached agreement on a
Settlement of the claims in the Consolidated Action including claims that had been pending
previously in Ohio, Maryland, and Alabama. The Settlement, if approved, would resolve all
litigation involving RALs which Block sold in Arkansas, Arizona, California, District of
Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota,
Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah,
Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin between January 1, 2000 and December 23, 2005.

Other cases are also being settled at the same time, in the same settlement agreement,
covering legal rights of individuals in a number of other jurisdictions.

3. Why Is This A Class Action? 

In a class action, one or more people called Class Representatives (in this case Renea Griffith,
Maryanne Hoekman and Justin Sevey), sue on behalf of people who have similar claims. All these
people are a Class or Class Members. One court resolves the issues for all Class Members, except
for those who exclude themselves from the Class. Circuit Court Judge Louis Bloom is in charge of
this class action.

4. Why Is There A Settlement? 

The Court did not decide in favor of Block or any of the Plaintiffs in the various lawsuits. The
Plaintiffs in those lawsuits think they could have won if they went to trial. Block thinks the
Plaintiffs would have lost. In fact, in most cases, Block thinks that the Plaintiffs would not have
even been able to continue their cases in court, because Block s RAL contract required them to try
their claims before an arbitrator. But there was no trial and no arbitration. Instead, both sides
agreed to a settlement. This avoids the cost of a trial, and the people affected have an
opportunity to be paid. The Class Representatives and the attorneys think the settlement is best
for all Class Members.

5. How Do I Know If I Am Part Of The Settlement? 

You received this notice because records identified you as a State Law class member. That means
that you fit the description of the class which the Court certified for this settlement. The Court
decided that everyone who fits this description is a Class Member:

All residents of Arkansas, Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Indiana,
Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Nevada,
Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin who applied for and
obtained a RAL through any medium, by any name, advertised, marketed, offered or made by or through
any lender through any office operating under the trade name of  H R Block  (including franchise or
sub-franchise offices of any Settling Defendant or Affiliate, or any H R Block offices such as in
Sears stores) from January 1, 2000 through December 23, 2005.

There are three other classes that are part of the overall Settlement. The following classes are
composed of people who live in one of the following jurisdictions and got a RAL through an H R
Block office during the specified years:

a.) The  Cummins  Class (West Virginia residents)   January 1, 1994 to December 23, 2005;

b.) The
 Mitchell/Green  Class (residents of Maryland and Alabama)
  Maryland   January 1, 1992
to May 19, 2000, excluding those people who obtained RALs after 1996 whose RAL application contains
an arbitration clause; Alabama   June 13, 1989 through December 31, 1996;

c.) The
 Becker  Class (residents of Ohio)   January 1, 2000 through December 23, 2005.

6. What Does The Settlement Provide? 

Block has agreed to provide additional information to customers who obtain RALs and to pay a total
of $62.5 million, plus costs of notice estimated at $4 million, to settle this case. The total
Block will pay is called the  common fund. 

You are a member of the State Law Class. State Law class members are entitled to over $22.5 million
of the $62.5 million, before deductions for the pro rata portion of administration costs,
attorney s fees and expenses relating to the State Law class, and service fees paid to the class
representatives, Renea Griffith, Maryanne Hoekman and Justin Sevey. The  Cummins  class members will
divide $32.5 million; the  Becker  class will divide over $5.8 million; and the  Mitchell/Green 
(Maryland and Alabama) class will divide more than $1.6 million; all before the same deductions are
made for administration costs, attorney s fees and expenses, and service fees applicable to each
class.

Members of the different classes who submit claims will receive different amounts because each of
these cases is at a different stage of proceedings, holds different risks and different chances of
success. Each class settlement was negotiated based upon these differences. The four classes are
represented independently.

7. How Much Will My Payments Be? 

In order to receive any payment, you must return a claim form (see Question 8 and the attached
claim form). Every Class Member who returns a valid claim form will receive at least some
distribution from the common fund. Your share of the fund will depend on the number of valid claim
forms that State Law Class Members send in and how many RALs you had. If every class member
submitted a claim, your share of the common fund would be a minimum of $1.67 for each RAL you
obtained during the class period. However, only a percentage of class members will actually
submit claim forms. For example, if only one of every four class members return claim forms, your
share of the fund would be $6.68 for each RAL you obtained ($1.67 times four). Your share will be
reduced by whatever percentage of the common fund is taken up with administration costs, attorney s
fees, expenses, and service payments. It is unlikely that such costs will exceed 30%, but they
could be higher or lower. Please remember that this is only an example; the amount you receive from
the settlement could be greater or smaller.

8. How Can I Get A Payment? 

To qualify for payment, you must send in a complete and valid claim form.  A claim form is attached
to this Notice.  You may also get a claim form from the Settlement Administrator s website
  www.INSERTWEBADDRESS.com  . Read the instructions carefully, fill out the form, include all the
information the form asks for, sign it, and mail it so that it is postmarked no later than  June
30, 2006.  You may also email the claim form to the Settlement
Administrator at
 claims @ INSERTWEBADDRESS.com . If you email the claim form, you must do so no later than midnight on  June
30, 2006. 

9. When Would I Get My Payment? 

The Court will hold a hearing at  time/date/month/2006 at the Kanawha County Judicial Annex, 111
Court Street, Charleston, West Virginia 25301,  to decide whether to approve the settlement. If the
Court approves the settlement after that, there may be appeals. It s always uncertain whether these
appeals can be resolved, and resolving them can take time, perhaps more than a year. The settlement
administrator will keep the settlement website at  www.INSERTWEBADDRESS.com  updated so that
everyone who is in the class may keep informed of the progress of the settlement. Please be
patient. Note: It is unlikely that you will receive your payment until six months or more after the
date you send in a claim form.

10. Am I Giving Up Anything To Get A Payment Or Stay In The Class? 

Unless you exclude yourself, also called  opting out  (see Question 12), you will be considered a
member of the class, which means that you can t sue, continue to sue, or be part of any other
lawsuit against Block about the legal issues in this case. Giving up your claims is called a
 release.  Unless you exclude yourself from the settlement, you will release your claims whether or
not you submit a claim form and receive payment.

However, certain claims are not released even if you stay in the class. All claims made in other
currently existing class actions that relate to the RAL or other products and services offered by
Block are not released. Claims under state law based solely on allegations that a tax preparer
failed (A) to properly prepare a tax return or (B) to maintain the confidentiality of taxpayer
information resulting in injury based on  stolen identity  or similar misuse of taxpayer
information or theft of a RAL check; and claims to enforce the terms and conditions of the
Settlement Agreement, are similarly not released.

Class members who do not exclude themselves, but do not make a claim for money from this settlement
may choose to arbitrate their individual claims against Block for another year after the settlement
is finalized. Although Class Counsel recommend this settlement, they take no position on your
likelihood of succeeding on an individual basis in an arbitration case. You should obtain

independent legal help if you need more information about the economic value of the arbitration
alternative to excluding yourself or making a claim for money under the settlement.

The settlement requires Block to follow certain business practices with future RALs, and provides
Block with an incentive to register as a Credit Service Organization ( CSO ) in the jurisdictions
covered by the settlement. Block has two years to decide whether to register and come into
compliance with the various CSO statutes.

Important:
  If  you decide to go back to Block to obtain a RAL during the two-year period Block has
to register as a CSO in the various jurisdictions,  and  Block does register and comply with your
jurisdiction s CSO statute in that two-year period, then you  will not be able to sue Block for any
new RAL violation that you claim happened during the two-year period.  But,  if Block does not
register  as a CSO and  comply  with the CSO statute in your jurisdiction, you will be able to sue
based on any new RAL violation that you claimed happened during that period. In addition, any
deadline on when you can sue Block (called the  statute of limitations ) will be suspended for the
two-year period.

11. Can I Exclude Myself From The Settlement (Sometimes Called  Opting Out )? 

Yes, you may  opt out  and exclude yourself from the Settlement Class. If you opt out, you will not
receive any payment from the common fund, you will not release any claims you may have against
Block, and you will not be bound by anything that happens in the Consolidated Action. If you opt
out, you will be free to pursue whatever legal rights you may have by pursuing your own lawsuit
against Block at your own risk and expense.

12. What Do I Do If I Want To Exclude Myself? 

In order to opt out and exclude yourself from the Settlement Class, you must mail a  Request for
Exclusion  to the Settlement Administrator at  address . Your Request for Exclusion must be in
writing and must be postmarked no later than May 1, 2006. To be effective, a Request for Exclusion
must contain: (a) the name of this case  (Cummins, v. H   R Block, Inc.); (b)  your name, address,
social security number and telephone number; (c) a statement that you want to opt out of the
lawsuit; and (d) your signature. If the Request for Exclusion is not postmarked by the deadline,
you will be included automatically in the Settlement Class and you may be eligible to receive
Settlement payments as summarized above. Even if you do not file a claim, you will be legally bound
by the proposed Settlement, including provisions releasing Block.

13. When And Where Will The Court Decide Whether To Approve The Settlement? 

The Court will hold a Fairness Hearing on  time/date/ at the Kanawha County Judicial Annex, 111
Court Street, Charleston, West Virginia 25301.  At this hearing the Court will consider whether the
settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. If there are objections, the Court will consider
them. The Court will listen to people who have asked to speak at the hearing. The Court may also
decide how much to pay to Class Counsel. After the hearing, the Court will decide whether to
approve the settlement. We do not know how long these decisions will take. The hearing can be
continued at any time by the Court without any further notice to you.

14. Do I Have To Come To The Hearing? 

No. You are not required to attend the hearing. But you are welcome to come at your own expense. If
you wish to speak, you may ask the Court for permission to speak at the Fairness Hearing. To do so,
you must send a letter saying that it is your  Notice of Intention to Appear in  Cummins v. H R
Block.   Be sure to include your name, address, telephone number, and your signature. Your Notice of
Intention to Appear must be received no later than  May 1, 2006,  and be sent to the Clerk of the
Court, Class Counsel, and Defense Counsel, at the addresses in Question 16. You cannot speak at the
hearing if you excluded yourself, because once you exclude yourself, the settlement does not affect
your rights.

15. What If I Do Nothing? 

If you do nothing, you ll get no money from this settlement. But, unless you exclude yourself, you
won t be able to start a lawsuit, continue with a lawsuit, or be part of any other lawsuit against
Block about the legal issues in this case. You would, however, be able to arbitrate your claims
against Block for another year, as described in Question 10.

16. What If I Want To Object To The Settlement? 

If you re a Class Member who has not requested exclusion, you can object to the settlement if you
don t like it. If you wish to object, you must write a letter stating your objections, the specific
reasons for each objection (including any legal support you want to bring to the Court s attention)
and a description of any evidence you wish to introduce in support of your objections. You must
include your name, address, telephone number and your signature. Also include the name and number
of this action  (Cummins v. H   R Block, Inc.,  Civil Action No. 03-C-134). Your letter must be
received in these four different places no later than  May 1, 2006: 

(i) Coordinating Counsel:

Brian A. Giasser, Esq.

Bailey   Glasser, LLP 
227 Capitol Street 
Charleston, WV 25301
 (ii) Defendants 
Counsel:

(iii) The Court:

Clerk of Court 
Kanawha County Circuit Court 
111 Court Street 
Charleston, WV 25301

17. What Is The Difference Between Excluding Myself And Objecting? 

Excluding yourself is telling the Court that you don t want to be part of the Class. If you
exclude yourself, you have no basis to object because the case no longer affects you. Objecting
is telling the Court that you don t like something about the settlement and you don t want the
Court to approve it. You can object only if you stay in the Class.

18. Who Are The Lawyers For The State Law Class? 

The Court has appointed the following law firms to represent you and other State Law Class
Members. These lawyers are called Class Counsel. If you want to be represented by your own
lawyer, you may hire one at your own expense.

19. How Will Class Counsel s Fees And Expenses Be Paid? 

Class Counsel will make an application to the Court for approval of an award of attorneys  fees and
expenses in an amount not more than 25% of the portion of the common fund attributable to the State
Law Class. The fees would pay Class Counsel for investigating the facts, litigating the case, and
negotiating the settlement. The Court will determine the amount of any fees and expenses awarded to
Class Counsel.

20. Does The Class Representative Get Additional Compensation? 

Subject to Court approval, the named plaintiffs in the five cases which make up the Consolidated
Action will seek  service awards  for their active participation in this litigation. Any such
 service award  will be paid from the portions of the common fund attributable to the cases those
plaintiffs brought. Renea Griffith, Maryanne Hoekman and Justin Sevey will seek a  service award 
of $5,000. The Court will determine whether they receive  service awards  and the amount of their
award.

21. What If The Court Does Not Approve The Settlement? 

If the Court does not approve the proposed Settlement as being fair, adequate and reasonable,
the Settlement Agreement will be null and void, and all parties will be returned to their
respective pre-Settlement status in the various lawsuits that the proposed Settlement hopes to
resolve.

22. Where Do I Get Additional Information? 

This notice summarizes the proposed settlement. You can find answers to common questions about the
settlement, plus other helpful information at the Settlement Administrator s website
 www.INSERTWEBADDRESS.com . You can also get a copy of the Settlement Agreement from the website,
or by writing to the Settlement Administrator at ####. If you cannot get the information you need

PROPOSED H R BLOCK COMMITMENTS 
PERTAINING TO REFUND ANTICIPATION LOANS 

A. H R Block Associate Training 

Objective: Ensure that all Tax Professionals, Tax Professional Assistants, Client Service
Coordinators, Office Support Coordinators, Office Managers, Office Supervisors, Client Care
Specialists, Phone Specialists, District Managers, Assistant District Managers, Administrative
Assistants who support any of these positions, and any similar or successor positions ( client
contact associates ) who work in H R Block tax offices or administrative locations such as call
centers that provide support to H R Block tax offices are trained to deliver refund anticipation
loans to their clients in a manner that accurately and non-coercively presents all of the
client s tax filing options and all of the client s disposition options for the client s refund
or balance due ( settlement options ) and enables the client to make an informed choice from
among the available alternatives. This objective will be implemented through a commitment to the
following business standards and practices:

1) 
       
     H R Block will produce training curriculum, updated at least annually, that provides
tax office associates and other client contact associates who work in H R Block tax
offices or administrative locations with in-depth knowledge of all tax filing and
settlement options. This training, which will be mandatory for all H R Block tax
professionals and other client contact associates, will counsel associates not to pre-judge
clients  interest or propensity to choose any particular option, and will emphasize that
clients should be fully informed of all options in order to make the most personally
appropriate choice. 

2) 
       
     The training module for the refund anticipation loan product will cover all product
features in depth, including these elements at minimum: 

i) 
       
     A RAL is a short-term loan based upon the client s anticipated tax
refund, and it must be repaid whether or not the IRS actually delivers the refund
for the expected dollar amount. 

ii) 
       
     A RAL is provided by a third party lender, (institution name). H R Block is not
the creditor, or a credit service provider, or a loan broker in this transaction. 

iii) 
       
     Part of the fee charged by the lender (to be described based on then-current
pricing structure) will be owed whether or not the RAL is approved. 

iv) 
       
     The annual percentage rate (APR) for a RAL is higher when compared to many other forms of
credit. 

v) 
       
     H R Block may purchase a financial interest in the RALs it originates. 

vi) 
       
     If the client owes debt for prior years  refund anticipation loans to any RAL provider, or
owes H R Block tax preparation or other fees, those debts may be deducted from the
amount of the client s RAL or, in the event a RAL is denied, from the client s
refund amount. 

vii) 
       
     Pursuant to the Refund Anticipation Loan Application signed by the tax client,
disputes that arise from the client s RAL decision (other than an individual claim
the client brings in small claims court) will be settled by arbitration if elected
by either party and no class actions can be brought in the arbitration forum. 

viii) 
       
     H R Block may use client information to market other products in
accordance with IRS regulations. 

1

Appendix    A 

Proposed H R Block Commitments 

2  

3) 
       
     The training module for refund anticipation loans will cover product delivery
requirements in depth, including these elements at minimum: 

i) 
       
     Tools used to inform clients about refund anticipation loans and other options
at client intake and during tax interview, 

ii) 
       
     Procedures for proper completion and retention of refund anticipation loan
paperwork including the application, loan agreement, and Truth-In-Lending-
Act disclosure? 

iii) 
       
     Necessity of verifying and documenting client identification, as required by the USA Patriot Act. 

iv) 
       
     RAL check distribution process, including methods for confirming identity when clients pick up checks. 

4) 
       
     Every tax office associate and other client contact associate who works in an H R Block
tax office or administrative location will be required to sign a statement affirming that
he/she has received training on refund anticipation loan products, and agreeing to
represent, explain and/or deliver the products as defined in sections (2) and (3) above. 

B. Product Delivery 

Objective: Ensure that the presentation and delivery of refund anticipation loans to
clients in H R Block tax offices is straightforward and non-coercive, and provides clients with
the information they need to make an informed choice from among the available alternatives.
This objective will be implemented through a commitment to the following business standards and
practices:

1) 
       
     Every H R Block client will be provided with a written description of all available
filing and settlement options. The lowest-cost alternatives (e-filing or mailing the return,
receiving a refund by direct deposit or IRS check, or paying the balance due from
personal funds) will be presented first. The higher-cost alternatives, including refund
anticipation checks and refund anticipation loans, will be presented last, and will be
clearly described as third party bank offerings available for an additional fee. 

2) 
       
     Every H R Block client, during the tax preparation process when the amount of the
client s refund or balance due is known, will be presented with a side-by-side comparison
of all applicable filing and settlement options in a screen shot in substantially the same
form as Exhibit 1 hereto. For refund clients, this comparison will show the fees and
timeline for refund delivery associated with each option, and the options will be arrayed
from lowest client cost to greatest client cost. 

3) 
       
     Every H R Block client who elects a refund anticipation loan will be provided with
additional disclosures before this product election is finalized and the return is e-filed.
These disclosures will be available for review in Spanish as well as English upon
request, and will inform the client: 

i) 
       
     A RAL is a short-term loan based upon the client s anticipated tax refund, and
it must be repaid whether or not the IRS actually delivers the refund for the
expected dollar amount. 

ii) 
       
     A RAL is provided by a third party lender, (institution name). H R Block is
not the creditor, or a credit service provider, or a loan broker in this
transaction. 

Appendix    A 

Proposed H R Block Commitments 

3  

iii) 
       
     Part of the fee charged by the lender (to be described based on then-current
pricing structure) will be owed whether or not the RAL is approved. 

iv) 
       
     A RAL may be canceled within 48 hours of application. However, the IRS
will nevertheless direct the client s refund to the lending bank per instructions
it received when the return was e-filed. This lender may charge the client a
partial fee to cover the costs of handling the client s refund, which will
typically be delivered in 8-15 days. 

v) 
       
     The annual percentage rate (APR) for a RAL is higher when compared to
many other forms of credit. 

vi) 
       
     H R Block may purchase a financial interest in the RALs it originates. 

vii) 
       
     If the client owes debt for prior years  refund anticipation loans to
any RAL provider, or owes H R Block tax preparation or other fees, those debts may
be deducted from the amount of the client s RAL or, in the event a RAL is denied,
from the client s refund amount. 

viii) 
       
     Pursuant to the Refund Anticipation Loan Application signed by the tax
client, disputes that arise from the client s RAL decision (other than an
individual claim the client brings in small claims court) will be settled by
arbitration if elected by either party and no class actions can be brought in the
arbitration forum. 

ix) 
       
     H R Block may use client information to market other products in
accordance with IRS regulations. 

4) 
       
     A product reference card will be produced annually that summarizes the refund
anticipation loan product attributes and disclosures. This will be made available at
every tax workstation to help tax associates discuss refund anticipation loans with their
clients. 

5) 
       
     H R Block tax office associates will inform clients who elect refund anticipation loans
that there are lower-cost ways to obtain a refund that do not involve the bank fees
associated with RALs. This information, delivered to the client in a written and/or
electronic format as part of a personalized advice report, will suggest that opening a
bank account would allow the un-banked client to take advantage of the IRS direct
deposit option that typically yields the client s refund in 8-15 days. Messaging to clients
who are known to have bank accounts will also emphasize the IRS direct deposit option. 

C.
Advertising   Marketing 

Objective: Ensure that all H R Block advertising and marketing materials are clear,
accurate and consistent in their presentation of refund anticipation loan products. This
objective will be implemented through a commitment to the following business standards and
practices:

1) 
       
     Any reference to a refund anticipation loan product in H R Block advertising and
marketing materials will describe the product as a  refund anticipation loan  rather
than any contraction or alternate construction such as  loan ,  refund loan ,  tax loan ,
 your money ,  your tax refund ,  rapid refund  or  refund advance . 

2) 
       
     Any reference to H R Block s  Instant Money  product will use  Instant Money refund
anticipation loan  rather than any contraction or alternate construction such as  Instant 

Appendix    A 

Proposed H R Block Commitments 

4  

Money
loan ,  Instant Money refund loan ,  Instant Money tax loan , or  Instant
Money refund advance .

3) 
       
     Advertising and marketing materials using the acronym
 RAL  will define that
acronym in its first occurrence by use of the phrase  refund
anticipation loan (RAL) . 

4) 
       
     H R Block advertising and marketing materials will refer to the proceeds of a
refund anticipation loan as a  loan check ,  refund anticipation loan check ,  RAL check  or
similar wording. H R Block advertising and marketing materials will not use
references like  refund ,  rapid refund ,  refund check ,  refund amount ,  your
money ,  your tax refund  or  your money fast  when describing the proceeds of a refund
anticipation loan. 

5) 
       
     H R Block advertising and marketing for standard refund anticipation loans Will
include clear and conspicuous disclosure, as that phrase is contemporaneously defined
by the Federal Trade Commission, that informs the audience: 

i) 
       
     A refund account fee and an additional fee, disclosed as a finance charge, are
charged by (institution name), the lender, 

ii) 
       
     RAL amount or refund amount (in the event a RAL is denied) may be reduced
by debts, if any, owed for prior year refund anticipation loans or other fees owed
to H R Block, such as tax preparation fees, 

iii) 
       
     Clients who e-file their returns and specify direct deposit to their own bank
accounts will typically receive their refunds in 8-15 days. 

6) 
       
     H R Block advertising and marketing for same-day ( Instant Money ) refund
anticipation loans will include clear and conspicuous disclosure, as that phrase is
contemporaneously defined by the Federal Trade Commission, that informs the audience: 

(l) 
       
     A refund account fee and an additional fee, disclosed as a finance charge, are
charged by (institution name), the lender. 

ii) 
       
     Availability is based on credit qualification. Clients not qualifying for a full
same-day RAL may receive a partial same-day RAL and/or a RAL available as
soon as one day later. 

iii) 
       
     RAL amount or refund amount (in the event a RAL is denied) may be reduced
by debts, if any, owed for prior year refund anticipation loans or other fees owed
to H R Block, such as tax preparation fees. 

iv) 
       
     Clients who e-file their returns and specify direct deposit to their own bank
accounts will typically receive their refunds in 8-15 days. 

D. Compliance   Performance Assessment 

Objective:  Ensure that H R Block standards pertaining to the marketing and delivery
of refund anticipation loans are met. This objective will be implemented through a
commitment to the following business standards and practices:

1) 
       
     The Compliance and Legal departments will have authority to approve, modify, or
veto any element of H R Block refund anticipation loan training, product delivery
systems and processes, and marketing   advertising that does not conform to the
standards specified in Sections A, B and C of this document. 

Appendix
A  

Proposed H R Block
Commitments 

5  

2) 
       
     H R Block will designate one or more members of its Tax Compliance unit to oversee
all training, delivery systems, and marketing   advertising pertaining to refund
anticipation loans. 

3) 
       
     H R Block will utilize  mystery shopping  at a representative sample of tax offices
each tax season to assess compliance with company standards for in office refund
anticipation loan product delivery. 

4) 
       
     H R Block will require each District Manager to review compliance with refund
anticipation loan disclosure, documentation, and product delivery standards throughout
each tax season by use of a checklist to be completed during office visits. Results of
these visits would be forwarded to the Compliance Department for review.

 H R Block  means each of H R Block, Inc. and each of its affiliates and subsidiaries (and
franchisees thereof);  Transmitter  means my electronic tax return transmitter, which may be the

1.  IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT . TO HELP THE GOVERNMENT
FIGHT THE FUNDING OF TERRORISM AND MONEY LAUNDERING ACTIVITIES, FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES ALL FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS TO OBTAIN, VERIFY, AND RECORD INFORMATION THAT IDENTIFIES EACH PERSON WHO OPENS AN
ACCOUNT. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR ME: WHEN I OPEN AN ACCOUNT, YOU WILL ASK FOR MY NAME, ADDRESS, DATE OF
BIRTH, AND OTHER INFORMATION THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO IDENTIFY ME. I MAY ALSO BE ASKED TO PRODUCE MY
DRIVER S LICENSE OR OTHER IDENTIFYING DOCUMENTS.

2.  Collections . In consideration of the ease and convenience of the following
method of paying any delinquent debt I owe or the other applicant owes to HSBC Taxpayer
Financial Services  inc.  ( HSBC TFS ), H R Block or Transmitter for prior years, or
Bank One, River City Bank, First Security Bank, Republic Bank, Santa Barbara Bank   Trust
or First Bank of Delaware (the  Other RAL Lenders ), and provided that such debt has not
been discharged in bankruptcy, I authorize and direct the repayment of such debt,
calculated as of the date of my Application, by means of (a) having such debt deducted from
the proceeds of my RAL, or (b) having my request for new loan proceeds denied or the amount
for which I have applied reduced and having such debt repaid to those entities by offset or
otherwise from my tax refund directly transmitted into my Refund Account with HSBC. If I
owe delinquent debt to more than one of the entities listed above, I authorize and direct
HSBC to pay such debts in the following order: HSBC TFS, Other RAL Lenders, and ERO. I also
authorize and instruct HSBC, HSBC TFS, and the Other RAL Lenders to disclose to each other
information about their respective credit experiences concerning my present and prior RALs,
Refund Anticipation Checks ( RACs ) or similar financial services, and my prior tax
returns.

PLEASE NOTE: If I have delinquent debt, I understand that HSBC or its servicer may be acting as a
debt collector to collect a debt and that any Information obtained will be used for that purpose.

3.  Applicable Law . This Application and all the other documents executed in
connection with this Application or my RAL (collectively,  Documents ) shall be governed by
and construed, interpreted, and enforced in accordance with federal law and, to the extent
state law applies, the law of the State of Delaware (without reference to conflict of laws
principles).

4.  Important Information About RALs . I understand that (a) I can file my federal income lax
return electronically without obtaining a RAL; (b) the IRS will send me a refund check or
electronically deposit my refund to my existing bank account; (c) the IRS normally makes an
electronic deposit in an average of about 12 days after an electronic filing; (d) HSBC tries to
make proceeds of an Instant RAL available on the day of application and a Classic RAL available on
the first business day after application; (e) HSBC cannot guarantee when any proceeds of a RAL or
an IRS refund will be available to me; and (f) a RAL may cost substantially more than other sources
of credit, and 1 may want to consider using other sources of credit.

5.  Deposit Authorization . (a) After I sign my Application, H R Block and/or my Transmitter
will electronically transmit my tax return to the IRS and my Application to HSBC. I understand
that I will sign or authorize an IRS Transmittal Form 8453 or IRS e-file signature authorization
( Deposit Authorization ) as part of my Application and electronic tax filing, and that the Deposit
Authorization and this Application provide an irrevocable agreement to have my tax refund disbursed
to HSBC, and irrevocably transfers to HSBC all of my rights, title, and interest in the proceeds of
my tax refund for purposes of the RAL I have requested and other purposes authorized by this
Application. (b) If my Application is denied or cancelled, and HSBC receives my tax refund, HSBC
will forward to me promptly any proceeds of my refund after deducting amounts permitted by this
Agreement. (c) If for any reason, any part of the anticipated tax refund is disallowed or offset by
the IRS, or if I should receive a refund check in the mail, I will advise HSBC immediately and
promptly pay HSBC any amounts owing with respect to my Application or a RAL, and pay H R Block
and/or my Transmitter any fees owed to them involving my tax return.

6.
 Refund Account . (a) I request that a deposit account ( Refund Account ) be
opened at HSBC upon receipt of my tax refund for the purposes of ensuring the repayment of
my RAL and other amounts described in the Documents. The Annual Percentage Yield and
interest rate on the Refund Account will be 0%. This means I will not receive any interest
on funds in the Refund Account. I understand that I cannot make withdrawals from the Refund
Account and that the funds in the Refund Account will be disbursed only as expressly
provided in the Documents. (b) HSBC may deduct any amounts I owe HSBC, H R Block, my
Transmitter or their affiliates from my tax refund, any funds received in the Refund
Account, and any proceeds of a RAL. My engagement with H R Block for services in connection
with my 2004 income tax return will end, and I am required to pay all fees to H R Block for
services rendered by H R Block, when I pick up my check for a RAL (or when HSBC
electronically transfers my proceeds to me or to another entity at my direction). If a
check or an electronic transfer of proceeds is not made available to me because I do not
receive a tax refund, then I am required to pay all fees to H R Block for services rendered
by H R Block on demand. HSBC also may withdraw amounts deposited into the Refund Account
from my tax refund to pay any check I receive for a RAL that I endorse and present for
payment or to disburse money to me in accordance with my Application. (c) I will not
receive a periodic statement for the Refund Account, but I will receive notice if funds in
the Refund Account are not sufficient to repay my RAL or are used for any purpose other
than repayment of my RAL or disbursement to me. HSBC may, immediately after disbursement of
all funds in the Refund Account, close the account without further notice to or
authorization from me.

7.  Refund Account Fee . I will pay HSBC a fee of $24.95 for the administration of
the Refund Account and any disbursements to me from that account ( Refund Account Fee ). I
irrevocably commit to pay the Refund Account Fee after the Deposit Authorization is filed
with the IRS regardless of whether (a) I apply for a RAL or (b) my Application is approved
or denied. The Refund Account Fee is not imposed directly or indirectly as an incident to
or condition of any extension of credit. I can avoid the Refund Account Fee if I direct
that my tax refund not be deposited to HSBC before filing my Deposit Authorization with the
IRS.

8.  No Fiduciary/Agency Duty . I understand that for various fees received, H R Block is
acting only as my tax preparer (if applicable), my electronic filer and the deliverer of checks for
RALs with respect to this RAL transaction. I understand that an affiliate of my ERO has the right to
purchase an interest in my RAL issued by HSBC. I further understand that H R Block is not acting in
a fiduciary, confidential, or agency capacity with respect to me in connection with this
transaction and has no other duties to me beyond the preparation of my tax return (if applicable),
the transmission of my tax return information to HSBC, the electronic filing of my tax return with
the IRS, and the delivery of checks for RALs. I acknowledge that I have independently evaluated and
decided to apply for a RAL, and that I am not relying on any recommendation from H R Block . I also
understand that HSBC is not acting in a fiduciary, confidential, or agency capacity with respect to
me in connection with this transaction.

9.  Disclosure Information . (a)  Information  means my 2004 federal and state income tax
returns, any information obtained in connection with my tax return (including information relating

the status of my tax return. The IRS and state tax agencies may disclose information about me and
my tax returns to the Authorized Parties. (f)  H R
Block  may not use or disclose Information for any
purpose, except as permitted under Treas. Reg. Sec.301.7216-2 or as provided in this Application.

provide me with a copy of my Application, loan agreement, billing statement or other document HSBC

11.  Arbitration Provision . Any claim, dispute or controversy between me and HSBC (as specifically
defined below for purposes of this Arbitration Provision), whether in contract or tort (intentional
or otherwise), whether pre-existing, present or future, and including constitutional, statutory,
common law, regulatory, and equitable claims in any way relating to (a) any of these or any other
Documents or any RAL or RAC that I have previously requested or received from HSBC, (b)
advertisements, promotions, or oral or written statements related to this or any other Application
for a RAL or any RAL or RAC that I have previously requested or received from HSBC, (c) the
relationship of HSBC and me relating to any of these or any other Documents or any RAL or RAC mat I
have
previously requested or received from HSBC; and (d) except as provided below, the validity,
enforceability or scope of this Arbitration Provision or any part thereof, including but not
limited to, the issue whether any particular claim, dispute or controversy must be submitted to
arbitration (collectively the  Claim ), shall be resolved, upon the election of either me or HSBC,
by binding arbitration pursuant to this Arbitration Provision and the applicable rules of the
American Arbitration Association ( AAA ) or the National Arbitration Forum ( NAF ) in effect at the
time the Claim is filed. I shall have the right to select one of these arbitration administrators
(the  Administrator ). The arbitrator must be a lawyer with more than ten (10) years of experience
or a retired or former judge. In the event of a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the
rules of the Administrator, this Arbitration Provision shall govern. In the event of a conflict
between this Arbitration Provision and the balance of this Application or any other Documents, this
Arbitration Provision shall govern. Notwithstanding any language in this Arbitration Provision to
the contrary, no arbitration may Be administered, without the consent of all parties to the
arbitration, by any organization that has in place a formal or informal policy that is inconsistent
with and purports to override the terms of this Arbitration Provision, including the Class Action
Wavier Provision defined below.

HSBC
hereby agrees not to invoke its right to arbitrate an individual
Claim I may bring in small
claims court or an equivalent court, if any, so long as the Claim is pending only in that court. No
class actions or private attorney general actions in court or in arbitration or joinder or
consolidation of claims in court or in arbitration with other persons, are permitted without the
consent of HSBC and me. The validity and effect of the preceding sentence (herein referred to as
the  Class Action Waiver Provision ) shall be determined exclusively by a court and not by the
Administrator or any arbitrator. Neither the Administrator nor any arbitrator shall have the power
or authority to waive, modify or fail to enforce the Class Action Waiver Provision, and any attempt
to do so, whether by rule, policy, arbitration decision or otherwise, shall be invalid and
unenforceable.

Any arbitration hearing that I attend will take place in a location that is reasonably convenient
for me. On any Claim I file, I will pay the first $50.00 of the filing fee. At my request, HSBC
will pay the remainder of the filing fee and any administrative or hearing fees charged by the
Administrator, up to $1,500.00 on any Claim asserted by me in the arbitration. If I should be
required to pay any additional fees to the Administrator, HSBC will consider a request by me to pay
all or part of the additional fees; however, HSBC shall not be obligated to pay any additional fees
unless the arbitrator grants me an award. If the arbitrator grants an award in my favor, HSBC will
reimburse me for any additional fees paid or owed by me to the Administrator up to the amount of
the fees that would have been charged if the original Claim had been for the amount of the actual
award in my favor. If the arbitrator issues an award in HSBC s favor, I will not be required to
reimburse HSBC for any fees HSBC has previously paid to the Administrator or for which HSBC is
responsible.

This Arbitration Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and
shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16 (the  FAA ). The
arbitrator shall apply substantive law consistent with the FAA, and not by any state law concerning
arbitration. The arbitrator shall follow and apply applicable substantive law to the extent
consistent with the FAA, statutes of limitation and claims of privilege and shall be authorized to
award all remedies permitted by applicable substantive law, including, without limitation,
compensatory, statutory and punitive damages, declaratory, injunctive and other equitable relief
and attorneys  fees and costs. The arbitrator will follow rules of procedure and evidence
consistent with the FAA, this Arbitration Provision and, to the extent consistent with this
Arbitration Provision, the Administrator s rules. Upon request of either party, the arbitrator
shall prepare a short reasoned written opinion supporting the arbitration award. Judgment upon the
award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator s award will be final and
binding except for. (a) any appeal right under the FAA; and (b) any appeal of Claims involving more
than $100,000. For such Claims, any party may appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel
appointed by the Administrator, which will reconsider de novo (i.e., in its entirety) any aspect or
all aspects of the initial award that is appealed. The panel s decision will be final and binding,
except for any appeal right under the FAA. Unless applicable law provides otherwise, the appealing
party will pay the appeal s costs (i.e., the amounts owed to the Administrator and the
arbitrators), regardless of its outcome. However, HSBC will consider in good faith any reasonable
request for HSBC to bear up to the full costs of the appeal. Nothing in this Arbitration Provision
shall be construed to prevent HSBC s use of offset or other contractual rights involving payment of
my income tax refund or other amount on deposit with HSBC to pay off any RAL, RAC, or similar
financial service, or H R Block or other fees, now or thereafter owed by me to HSBC or any Other
RAL Lender or H R Block or third party pursuant to the Documents or similar prior documents.

I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, BUT I PREFER
TO RESOLVE ANY SUCH CLAIMS THROUGH ARBITRATION AND HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE MY RIGHTS
TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, UPON ELECTION OF ARBITRATION BY HSBC OR BY
ME. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF
ANY CLASS OF CLAIMANTS OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PERTAINING TO ANY CLAIM SUBJECT TO
ARBITRATION. I UNDERSTAND THAT, IF I AM A MEMBER OF THE PUTATIVE CLASS IN CUMMINS, ET AL. V. H R
BLOCK, INC, ET AL., CASE NO. 03-C-134 IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF KANAWHA COURT, WV, THIS ARBITRATION
CLAUSE MAY NOT ACT AS A WAIVER OF THE RIGHTS AND CLAIMS I MAY HAVE IN THAT ACTION.

This Arbitration Provision shall supersede all prior Arbitration Provisions contained in any
previous RAL or RAC application or related agreement and shall survive repayment of any RAL or RAC
and termination of my account; provided, however, that if I reject this Arbitration Provision as
set below, any prior Arbitration Provisions shall remain in full force and effect. If any portion of
this
Arbitration Provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining
portions of this Arbitration Provision. However, if a determination is made that the Class Action
Waiver Provision is unenforceable, this Arbitration Provision (other than this sentence) and any
prior Arbitration Provision shall be null and void.

To reject this Arbitration Provision, I must send HSBC, c/o HSBC Taxpayer Financial Services Inc.,
Account Research, P.O. Box 18097, Jacksonville, FL 32229, a signed writing ( Rejection Notice )
that is received within thirty (30) days after the date I sign this Application. The Rejection

If the Rejection Notice is sent on my behalf by a third party, such third party must include
evidence of his or her authority to submit the Rejection Notice on my behalf.

As used in this Arbitration Provision, the term  HSBC  shall mean HSBC Bank USA, National
Association, HSBC TFS, Household Bank, f.s.b., Beneficial National Bank, and H R Block, Inc., and
each of their parents, wholly or majority-owned subsidiaries, affiliates, or predecessors,
successors, assigns and the franchisees of any of them, and each of their officers, directors,

The following line and language will be inserted at the end of the HRB RAL Application. 

By signing
below, I am indicating that I fully understand that I am applying for a loan and that I
have read, understand and agree to the terms set forth in this Application above and on the
following pages, including but not limited to: (a) Section 2 in which I agree that HSBC may use
amounts received from my tax refund to pay certain delinquent debts; and (b) Section I in which I
agree, upon my or HSBC s election, to arbitrate any Claims that I may have. I also acknowledge that
I have 30 days from today s date to reject the Arbitration Provision by following the procedure

Payments  section on my Loan Agreement and Disclosure Statement or subsequent replacement TILA
Disclosure Statement, if any, on demand or when the anticipated refund from the IRS is

Loan Agreement 

1.  Obligation on RAL .

(a) I am obligated, on the date I sign this Agreement, to accept a RAL if
HSBC approves my Application, unless HSBC approves me for a smaller RAL than the
amount set forth in the Total of Payments section in the TILA Disclosure Statement
above. If I am approved for a smaller RAL, I will be provided with a replacement
TILA Disclosure Statement and I will be obligated to accept the smaller RAL if I
accept the RAL proceeds check. My loan will begin, and HSBC will earn the finance
charge, when I am approved for the RAL and the proceeds check or stored value card
is made available or a transfer is initiated to my bank account.

(b) I may cancel my RAL transaction, or my obligation to accept a RAL, for up to 48 hours after I
become obligated to accept the RAL. To do so, I must return to HSBC or the office where I received
my RAL proceeds check any check I have received (or cash in the amount of the RAL proceeds check if
I have cashed the check or received a transfer to my bank account), and comply with other
requirements set by HSBC. I understand that, if I use my right to cancel, my finance charge will be
refunded to me, HSBC will provide me with any tax refund only after HSBC receives the refund from
the IRS, and I must still pay a Refund Account Fee.

2.
 Security Interest . If I receive a RAL, I grant HSBC a security interest in the property
described in the TILA Disclosure Statement as collateral for my obligations to repay the RAL and
perform my other obligations under the Application and this Agreement.

3.  Deductions . My Prepaid Finance Charge, Refund Account Fee, fees for the completion and
system administration of my income tax return by H R Block, and prior year debt owed to H R Block
shall be deducted from the proceeds of my RAL.

4.
 Other Charges . (a) I agree to pay a returned check charge
of  19 if any check
or similar instrument I give HSBC is not honored. (b) I agree to pay a late charge as
described in the TILA Disclosure Statement if I do not repay my loan when due. (c) In the
event that I pay my account by telephone, I agree to pay up to a $10 fee for each such

2

payment. HSBC reserves the right to change such fee from time to time. I may call Customer Service
for a current fee schedule. (d) I also agree to pay any attorney s fees and collection agency costs
incurred by HSBC or its affiliates to collect any delinquent RAL as permitted by law,

5.  Instant RAL.  If I receive an Instant RAL, and if the electronic filing of my
return is rejected by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ),
I authorize  H R Block  to insert
my Refund Account number at HSBC, together with HSBC s routing transit number, on my signed
paper returns, and mail them to the IRS.

6.
 Application of Payments.  Each payment I make on the RAL will be applied in any
order determined by HSBC.

D. 
       
     If I choose to receive proceeds by a stored value card, I agree to the terms set forth in the
stored value card agreement provided to me, which is incorporated herein by reference. Certain fees
shall apply. 

6. 
       
      IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT . TO HELP THE GOVERNMENT
FIGHT THE FUNDING OF TERRORISM AND MONEY LAUNDERING ACTIVITIES, FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES ALL FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS TO OBTAIN, VERIFY, AND RECORD INFORMATION THAT IDENTIFIES EACH PERSON WHO OPENS AN
ACCOUNT. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR ME: WHEN I OPEN AN ACCOUNT, YOU WILL ASK FOR MY NAME, ADDRESS, DATE
OF BIRTH, AND OTHER INFORMATION THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO IDENTIFY ME. YOU MAY ALSO ASK TO SEE MY
DRIVER S LICENSE OR OTHER IDENTIFYING DOCUMENTS. 

7. 
       
      Applicable Law . This Application and all other documents executed in connection with
this Application for my  Bank Product (collectively,  Documents ), shall be governed by and
construed, interpreted, and enforced in accordance with federal law and, to the extent state law
applies, the law of the State of Delaware (without reference to conflict of laws principles). 

8. 
       
      Important Information About Bank Products . I understand that: (a) I can file my federal
income tax return electronically without obtaining a Bank Product; (b) the IRS will send me a refund check or
electronically deposit my refund to my existing bank account; (c) the IRS normally makes an
electronic deposit in an average of about 12 days after an electronic filing; (d) I will not
receive the proceeds of a RAC or RPT until HSBC receives my tax refund from the IRS; (e) HSBC
tries to make proceeds of an Instant RAL available on the day of application and a Classic RAL
available on the first business day after application; (f) HSBC cannot guarantee when any proceeds
of 

2

a Bank Product or an IRS or state tax refund will be available to me; and (g) a RAL may cost
substantially more than other sources of credit, and I may want to consider using other sources of
credit. 

9. 
       
      Deposit Authorization . (a) After I sign my Application, my ERO and/or my
Transmitter will electronically transmit my tax return to the IRS and
my Application to
HSBC. I understand that I will sign or authorize an IRS Transmittal Form 8453, IRS e-file
signature authorization, and/or appropriate state deposit authorization form ( Deposit
Authorization ) as part of my Application and electronic tax filing, and that the Deposit
Authorization and this Application provide an irrevocable agreement to have my tax refund
disbursed to HSBC, and irrevocably transfers to HSBC all of my rights, title, and interest
in the proceeds of my tax refund, for purposes of the Bank Product I have requested and
other purposes authorized by this Application. (b) If my Deposit Authorization results in a
state tax refund being received in my Refund Account, I agree that
such refund may be disbursed to HSBC to pay any RAL I have obtained before being otherwise disbursed. (c) If My Application is
denied or cancelled, and HSBC receives my tax refund, HSBC will forward to me promptly any
proceeds of my refund after deducting amounts permitted by this Agreement. (d) If I apply
for a RAL, and if for any reason, any part of the anticipated tax refund is disallowed or
offset by the IRS, or if I should receive a refund check in the mail, I will advise HSBC
immediately and promptly pay HSBC any amounts owing with respect to my Application or RAL,
and pay my ERO any fees owed to them involving my tax return. If I apply for RAC or RPT,
and in the event a RAC or RPT, is not issued, I still owe and agree to pay any fees owed
to the ERO and refund account fees, and if a RAC or RPT is issued, you will look only to
amounts received into the refund account, up to the amount of the RAC or RPT, as the
consideration for the RAC or RPT. 

10. 
       
      Refund Account .(a) I request that a  deposit
account  ( Refund Account ) be
opened at HSBC upon receipt of my tax refund for the purposes of ensuring the repayment of
my Bank Product and other amounts described in the Documents. The Annual Percentage Yield
and interest rate on the Refund Account will be 0%. This means I will not receive any
interest on funds in the Refund Account. I understand I cannot make withdrawals from the
Refund Account and that the funds in the Refund Account will be disbursed only as
expressly provided in the Documents. (b) HSBC may deduct any amounts I owe HSBC, my ERO,
my Transmitter or their affiliates from my tax refund, any funds received in the Refund
Account, and any proceeds of a Bank Product. My engagement with the ERO for services in
connection with my 2004 income tax return will end, and I am required to pay all fees to
the ERO for services rendered by the ERO, when my Bank Product check is made available to
me (or when HSBC electronically transfers my proceeds to me or to another entity at my
direction). If a check or an electronic transfer of proceeds is not made available to me
because I do not receive a tax refund, then I am required to pay all fees to the ERO for
services rendered by the ERO on demand. HSBC also may withdraw amounts deposited into the
Refund Account from my tax refund to pay any check I receive for a Bank Product that I
endorse and present for payment or to disburse money to me in accordance with my
Application. (c) I will not receive a periodic statement for the Refund Account, but I
will receive notice if funds in the Refund Account are not sufficient to repay my Bank
Product or are used for any purpose other than repayment of my Bank Product or
disbursement to me. HSBC may, immediately after disbursement of all funds in the Refund
Account, close the account without further notice to or authorization from me. 

11. 
       
      Refund Account Fee . I will pay HSBC a fee of $27.95 if I apply for a Federal
RAC or a RAL and receive my proceeds by check or through a stored value card, where
available, or $14.95 if I apply for a Federal RPT or a RAL and receive my proceeds by direct deposit, for the administration of the Refund Account and any disbursements
to me from that account ( Refund Account Fee ). I irrevocably commit to pay the Refund
Account Fee after the Deposit Authorization is filed with the IRS and regardless of
whether (a) I apply for a Bank Product or (b) my Application is approved or denied. The
Refund Account Fee is not imposed directly or indirectly as an incident to or condition
of any extension of credit. I can avoid the Refund Account Fee if I direct that my tax
refund not be deposited to HSBC before filing my Deposit Authorization with the IRS. 

12. 
       
       Collections . In consideration of the ease and convenience of the following
method of paying any delinquent debt I owe or the other applicant owes to HSBC, HSBC
Taxpayer Financial Services Inc. ( HSBC TFS ), my ERO or
Transmitter for prior years, or
Bank One, River City Bank, First Security Bank, Republic Bank or Santa Barbara Bank  
Trust (the  Other RAL Lenders ), and provided that such debt has not been discharged in
bankruptcy, I authorize and direct the repayment of such debt, calculated as of the date
of my Application, by means of (a) having such debt deducted from the proceeds of my Bank
Product, or (b) having my Application denied or the amount for which I have applied
reduced and having such debt repaid to those entities by offset or otherwise from my tax
refund directly transmitted into my Refund Account at HSBC. If I owe delinquent debt to
more than one of the entities listed above, I authorize and direct HSBC to pay such debts
in the following order, HSBC, HSBC TFS, Other RAL Lenders, and ERO. I also authorize and
Instruct HSBC and the Other RAL Lenders to disclose to each other information about their
respective credit  

3

experiences concerning my present and prior Bank Products or similar financial services, and my
prior tax returns.  

PLEASE NOTE: If I have delinquent debt, I understand that HSBC or HSBC TFS may be acting as a debt
collector hereunder to collect a debt and that any information obtained will be used for that
purpose.

these or any other Documents or any RAC, RPT, or RAL that I have previously requested or
received from HSBC, (b) advertisements, promotions, or oral or written statements related
to this or any other Application for a RAL or RAC, RPT, or RAL that I have previously
requested or received from HSBC, (c) the relationship of HSBC and me relating to any of
these or any other Documents or any RAC, RPT, or RAL that I have previously requested or
received from HSBC; and (d) except as provided below, the validity, enforceability or scope
of this Arbitration Provision or any part thereof, including, but not limited to, the
issue of whether any particular claim, dispute or controversy must be submitted to
arbitration (collectively the  Claim ), shall be resolved, upon the election of either me
or HSBC, by binding arbitration pursuant to this Arbitration Provision and the applicable
rules of either the JAMS or the National Arbitration Forum ( NAF ) in effect at the time
the Claim is filed. I shall have the right to select one of these arbitration
administrators (the  Administrator ). The arbitrator must be a lawyer with more than ten
(10) years of experience or a retired or former judge. In the event of a conflict between
this Arbitration Provision and the rules of the Administrator, this Arbitration Provision
shall govern. In the event of a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the balance
of this Application or any other Documents, this Arbitration Provision shall govern. 

HSBC hereby agrees not to invoke its right to arbitrate an individual Claim I may bring in small
claims court or an equivalent court, if any, so long as the Claim is pending only in that court. No
class actions or private attorney 

4

general actions in court or in arbitration or joinder or
consolidation of claims in court or in arbitration with other persons, are permitted without the
consent of the parties hereto. The validity and effect of the preceding sentence (hereinafter
referred to as the  class action waiver provision ) shall be determined exclusively by a court and
not by an arbitrator. Any arbitration hearing that I attend will take place in a location that is reasonably convenient for me. On any Claim I file, I will pay the first $50.00 of the filing fee.
At my request, HSBC will pay the remainder of the filing fee and any administrative or hearing fees
charged by the Administrator, up to $1,500,00 on any Claim asserted by me in the arbitration. If I
should be required to pay any additional fees to the Administrator, HSBC will consider a request by
me to pay all or part of the additional fees; however, HSBC shall not be obligated to pay any
additional fees unless the arbitrator grants me an award. If the arbitrator grants an award in my
favor, HSBC will reimburse me for any additional fees paid or owed by me to the Administrator up to
the amount of the fees that would have been charged if the original Claim had been for the amount
of the actual award in my favor. If the arbitrator issues an award in
HSBC s favor, I will not be
required to reimburse HSBC for any fees HSBC has previously paid to the Administrator or for which
HSBC is responsible. 

This Arbitration Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and
shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16 (the  FAA ), and not by
any state law concerning arbitration. The arbitrator shall follow and apply applicable substantive
law to the extent consistent with the FAA, statutes of limitation and claims of privilege and shall
be authorized to award all remedies permitted by applicable substantive law, including, without
limitation, compensatory, statutory and punitive damages, declaratory, injunctive and other
equitable relief and attorneys  fees and costs. The arbitrator will follow rules of procedure and
evidence consistent with the FAA, this Arbitration Provision and the Administrator s rules. Upon
request of either party, the arbitrator shall prepare a short reasoned written opinion supporting
the arbitration award. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The
arbitrator s award will be final and binding except for: (a) any appeal right under the FAA; and
(b) Claims involving more than $100,000. For such Claims, any party may appeal the award to a
three-arbitrator panel appointed by the Administrator, which will reconsider de novo (i.e., in its
entirety) any aspect or all aspects of the initial award that is appealed. The panel s decision
will be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the FAA. Unless applicable law
provides otherwise, the appealing party will pay the appeal s costs (i.e., the amounts owed to the
Administrator and the arbitrators), regardless of its outcome. However, HSBC will consider in good
faith any reasonable request for HSBC to bear up to the full costs of the appeal. Nothing in this
Arbitration Provision shall be construed to prevent HSBC s use of offset or other contractual
rights involving payment of my income tax refund or other amount on deposit with HSBC to pay off
any Bank Product or similar financial service, or ERO or other fees, now or thereafter owed by me
to HSBC or any Other RAL Lender or ERO or third party pursuant to the Documents or similar prior
documents. 

I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, BUT I PREFER
TO RESOLVE ANY SUCH CLAIMS THROUGH ARBITRATION AND HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE MY RIGHTS
TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, UPON ELECTION OF ARBITRATION BY HSBC OR BY
ME. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF
ANY CLASS OF CLAIMANTS OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PERTAINING TO ANY CLAIM SUBJECT TO
ARBITRATION. 

This Arbitration Provision shall supersede any prior Arbitration Provision contained in any
previous Bank Product application or related agreement and shall survive repayment of any Bank
Product and termination of my account; provided, however, that if I reject this Arbitration
Provision as set forth below, all prior Arbitration Provisions shall remain in full force and
effect. If any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not
invalidate the remaining portions of this Arbitration Provision.

How We Handle Information we Obtain 

It is important for you to know that in order to ensure that our customers get
the very best service and the highest quality products, HSBC collects demographic information (like your name and

typically for products and services that you might not otherwise bear about.
The information we may provide them comes from the sources described above and
might include your name, address and phone number. You may tell us not to share
information with non-affiliated companies in this way by completing the form

internet service provider) with whom we have an agreement. The information we
may share also comes from the sources described above and might include your
name, address, phone number, and account experience with us.

Finally, we provide information about you to non-affiliated companies

Loan Agreement  

1.
 Obligation on RAL. 

(a) I am obligated, on the date I sign this Agreement, to accept a RAL if HSBC approves my
Application, unless HSBC approves me for a smaller RAL than me amount set forth in the Total of
Payments section in the TILA Disclosure Statement above. If I am approved for a smaller RAL, I
will be provided with a replacement TILA Disclosure Statement and I will be obligated to accept
the smaller RAL if 1 accept the RAL proceeds check. My loan will begin, and HSBC will earn the
finance charge, when I am approved for the RAL and the proceeds check is made available or a
transfer is initiated to my bank account.

4

(b) I may cancel my RAL transaction, or my obligation to accept a RAL, for up to 48
hours after I become obligated to accept the RAL. To do so, I must return to HSBC or the office
where I received my RAL proceeds check any check I have received (or
cash in the amount of the
RAL proceeds check if I have cashed the check or received a transfer to my bank account),
and comply with other requirements set by HSBC. I understand that, if
I use my right to cancel,
my finance charge will be refunded to me, HSBC will provide me with any tax refund only after
HSBC receives the refund from the IRS, and I must still pay a Refund Account Fee.

2.  Security
Interest.  If I receive a RAL, I grant HSBC a security interest in the
property described in the TILA
Disclosure Statement as collateral for my obligations to repay the RAL and perform my other
obligations under the
Application and this Agreement.

3.  Deductions.  My Prepaid Finance Charge, transmitter fees, Refund Account Fee, fees for
the completion and
electronic filing of my income tax return by my ERO, and fee for document preparation shall be
deducted from the
proceeds of my RAL.

4.  Other
Charges.  (a) I agree to pay a returned check charge of $19 if any check or
similar instrument I give HSBC
is not honored, (b) I agree to pay a late charge as described in the TILA Disclosure Statement
if I do not repay my
loan when due. (c) In the event that I pay my account by
telephone, I agree to pay up to a $10
fee for each such
payment HSBC reserves the right to change such fee from time to time. I may call Customer
Service for a current
fee schedule, (d) I also agree to pay any attorney s fees and collection agency costs incurred
by HSBC or its
affiliates to collect any delinquent RAL as permitted by law.

5.  Instant RAL.  If I receive an Instant RAL, and if the electronic filing of my
return is rejected by the Internal
Revenue Service ( IRS ), I authorize my ERO to insert my Refund Account number at HSBC,
together with
HSBC s routing transit number, on my signed paper returns and mail them to the IRS.

6.  Application of Payments.  Each payment I make on the RAL will be applied in any order
determined by HSBC.

APPLICATION FOR 
AN ELECTRONIC REFUND ADVANCE LOAN AND TO OPEN A DEPOSIT ACCOUNT

System Protected by U. S.  Patent Nos. 4,890,228,5,193,057, and 5,963,921

This Application is submitted to HSBC Bank USA, National Association ( HSBC ) for an Electronic
Refund Advance Loan ( ERA ) and a Refund Account. As used herein,  BFC  means Block Financial
Corporation and its parents, subsidiaries and affiliates;  HSBC TFS  means HSBC Taxpayer Financial
Services Inc.;  IRS  means the Internal Revenue Service;
and  RAL  means a refund anticipation loan.

1.  
       
       INFORMATION   

I understand and confirm that the name, home address, mailing address, social
security/taxpayer identification number, and date of birth which I entered into the
personal information and address sections of the online tax preparation product are true
and correct and are incorporated in this Application by this
reference as the name, home
address, mailing address, social security/taxpayer identification number, and date of
birth of each applicant. 

2.  
       
       IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT.  TO HELP THE
GOVERNMENT FIGHT THE FUNDING OF TERRORISM AND MONEY LAUNDERING ACTIVITIES, FEDERAL LAW
REQUIRES ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO OBTAIN, VERIFY, AND RECORD INFORMATION THAT
IDENTIFIES EACH PERSON WHO OPENS AN ACCOUNT. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR ME: WHEN I OPEN AN ACCOUNT,
YOU WILL ASK FOR MY NAME, ADDRESS, DATE OF BIRTH, AND OTHER INFORMATION THAT WILL ALLOW YOU
TO IDENTIFY ME. YOU MAY ALSO SEEK TO VERIFY MY IDENTITY THROUGH NON-DOCUMENTARY METHODS.  

3.  
       
       Payment Instructions   

A. 
       
     If I receive an ERA, I understand I am to receive my ERA proceeds via
direct deposit into the bank account that
I will designate on the Direct Deposit screen of this online tax preparation product
application during the
Electronic Filing process, and I authorize HSBC to direct deposit my funds to that
designated account. 

B. 
       
     If my refund is greater than my ERA, I understand I am to receive my
excess funds via direct deposit into the
bank account that I previously designated on the Direct Deposit screen of this
online tax preparation product
application and I authorize HSBC to direct deposit my funds to that
designated account. 

4.  
       
      HSBC ERA DISCLOSURE STATEMENT:  

The FINANCE CHARGE for my ERA is set forth on my Truth in Lending Disclosure. I know
that even if my ERA is denied, I am responsible for my electronic filing, as applicable. I
am also responsible for the repayment of my ERA whether or not my tax refund it paid to my
account with HSBC in whole or in part. I understand that my income tax return can be filed
etectronically without obtsining an ERA and, subject to IRS processing, the usual time
within which I can expect to receive a refund check If I file electronically and without an
ERA is within approximately three weeks from the date I file my return. The IRS
normally mikes an electronic deposit to an average of about 12 days after an electronic
filing. Alternatively, if I elect to obtain and am approved for an ERA, the loan proceeds
usually will be made available to me within approximately 1-2 days of my loan application. 

The usual duration of an ERA is approximately II days from
the date of approval of the ERA.
The following are examples of the estimated ANNUAL
PERCENTAGE RATE ( APR ) and ERA FINANCE CHARGES on ERAs of
varying amounts based on II-day
maturity periods. Because the APR on
an ERA may be high in certain cases relative to other sources of credit, 1 understand that
it may cost less to use such sources; e.g., credit cards, equity
lines, etc., instead of an ERA. 

* 
       
     I understand I will be given disclosures which will show the actual
finance charge and other charges applicable to my ERA transaction.  e  =
estimate 

5. 
       
      Applicable Law . This Application and all the other documents executed in
connection with this Application or my
ERA (collectively,  Documents ), shall be governed by and construed, interpreted, and
enforced in accordance with
federal law and, to the extent state law applies, the law of the state of Delaware (without
reference to conflict of laws
principles). 

6. 
       
      Important Information About ERAs  . I understand that: (a) I can file my federal income tax return electronically
without obtaining an ERA; (b) the IRS will send me a refund check or electronically deposit
my refund to my existing bank account; (c) the IRS normally makes en electronic deposit in
an average of about 12 days after an electronic filing; (d) HSBC tries to initiate the
direct deposit of proceeds of an ERA on the first business day after application; (e) HSBC
cannot guarantee when any proceeds of an ERA will be available to me; and (f) a ERA may
cost substantially more than another type of loan I might obtain. 

7. 
       
      Deposit Authorization . (a) After I submit my Application, BFC will electronically
transmit my tax return to the IRS
and my Application to HSBC. I understand that 1 will authorize or agree to an IRS Transmittal
Form 8453 or IRS e-file signature authorization ( Deposit Authorization ) as part of my Application and electronic tax
filing, and that
the Deposit Authorization and this Application provide an irrevocable agreement to have my tax
refund disbursed to
HSBC, and irrevocably transfers to HSBC all my rights, title, and interest in the proceeds of my
tax refund for
purposes of the ERA I have requested and other purposes authorized by
this Application. (b) If my
Application is
denied or cancelled, and HSBC receives my tax refund, HSBC will forward to me promptly any
proceeds of my
refund after deducting amounts permitted by this Agreement. (c) If for any reason, any part of
the anticipated tax
refund is disallowed or offset by the IRS, or if I should receive a refund check in the mail,
I will advise HSBC
immediately and promptly pay HSBC any amounts owing with respect to my Application or an ERA,
and pay BFC
any fees owed to them involving my tax return. 

8. 
       
      Refund Account . (a) I request that a deposit account be opened ( Refund
Account ) at HSBC upon receipt of my
tax refund for the purposes of ensuring the repayment of my ERA and other amounts described in
the Documents.
The Annual Percentage Yield and interest rate on the Refund Account will be 0%. This means I
will not receive any
interest on funds in the Refund Account. I understand that I cannot make withdrawals from the
Refund Account and
that the funds in the Refund Account will be disbursed only as expressly provided in the
Documents. (b) HSBC
may deduct any amounts I owe HSBC or BFC from my tax refund, any funds received in the Refund
Account, and
any proceeds of an ERA. I am required to pay all fees to BFC for services rendered by BFC when HSBC
electronically transfers my proceeds to me. If an electronic transfer of proceeds is not made
available to me because
I do not receive a tax refund, then I am required to pay all fees to BFC for services rendered
by BFC on demand.
HSBC also may withdraw amounts deposited into the Refund Account from my tax refund to
disburse money to me in accordance with my Application, (c) I will not receive a periodic
statement for the Refund Account, but I will receive notice if funds in the Refund Account
are not sufficient to repay my ERA or are used for any purpose other than repayment of my
ERA or disbursement to me. HSBC may, immediately after disbursement of all funds in the
Refund Account, close the account without further notice to or authorization from me. 

9. 
       
      Refund Account Fee . I will pay HSBC a fee of $11.95 for the administration
of the Refund Account and any
disbursements to me from that account ( Refund Account Fee ). I am obligated to pay the Refund
Account Fee
after the Deposit Authorization is filed with the IRS and is imposed regardless of whether (a)
I apply for an ERA or
(b) my Application is approved or denied. The Refund Account Fee is not imposed directly or
indirectly as an incident to or condition of any extension of credit. I can avoid the
Refund Account Fee if I direct that my tax refund not be deposited to HSBC before filing my
Deposit Authorization with the IRS. 

10. 
       
       Collections . In consideration of the ease and convenience of the
following method of paying any delinquent
debt I owe or the other applicant owes to HSBC, HSBC TFS, my electronic return originator
( ERO ) for
prior yean, BFC, or Bank One, River City Bank, First Security Bank, Republic Bank or Santa
Barbara Bank
  Trust (the  Other ERA or RAL Lenders ), and provided that such debt has not been discharged
in
bankruptcy, I authorize and direct the repayment of such debt, calculated as of the date of my
Application,
by means of (a) having such debt deducted from the proceeds of my ERA, or (b) having my request for
an
ERA denied or the amount for which I have applied reduced and having such debt repaid to those
entitles by
offset or otherwise from my lax refund directly transmitted into my Refund Account at HSBC. If I
owe
delinquent debt to more than one of the entities listed above, I authorize and direct HSBC to
pay such debts
in the following order: HSBC, HSBC TFS, Other ERA or RAL Lenders, ERO, and BFC, I also
authorize and instruct HSBC and the Other ERA or RAL Lenders to disclose to each other
Information about their respective credit experiences concerning my present and prior ERAs,
refund anticipation loans ( RALs ), or similar financial services, and my prior tax
returns.

purpose.

return information to HSBC, and the electronic filing of my tax return with the IRS
and/or state taxing authority. I understand that BFC or an affiliate

14. 
       
      Arbitration Provision . Any claim, dispute or controversy between me and HSBC (at
specifically defined below far
purposes of this Arbitration Provision), whether in contract or tort (intentional or
otherwise), whether pre-existing,
present or future, and including constitutional, statutory, common law, regulatory, and
equitable claims in any way
relating to (a) any of these or any other Documents or any ERA that I have previously
requested or received from
HSBC, (b) advertisements, promotions, or oral or written statements related to this or any
other Application for a
RAL or any ERA that I have previously requested or received from HSBC, (c) the relationship
of HSBC and me
relating to any of these or any other Documents or any ERA that I have previously requested or
received from
HSBC; and (d) except as provided below, the validity, enforceability or scope of this
Arbitration Provision or any part thereof, including, but not limited to, the issue whether
any particular claim, dispute or controversy must be
submitted to arbitration (collectively the  Claim ), shall be resolved, upon the election of
either me or HSBC, by
binding arbitration pursuant to this Arbitration Provision and the applicable rules of the
American Arbitration
Association ( AAA ) or the National Arbitration Forum ( NAF ) in effect at the time the Claim
is filed. I shall
have the right to select one of these arbitration administrators (the  Administrator ). The
arbitrator must be a lawyer with more than ten (10) years of experience or a retired or
former judge. In the event of a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the rules
of the Administrator, this Arbitration Provision shall govern. In the event of a
conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the balance of this Application or any other
Documents, this
Arbitration Provision shall govern. Notwithstanding any language in this Arbitration
Provision to the contrary, no
arbitration may be administered, without the consent of all parties to the arbitration, by any
organization that has in
place a formal or informal policy that is inconsistent with and purports to override the terms
of this Arbitration
Provision, including the Class Action Waiver Provision defined below. 

HSBC hereby agrees not to invoke its right to arbitrate an
individual Claim I may bring in
small claims court or an equivalent court, if any, so long as the Claim is pending only in
that court. No class actions or private attorney general actions in court or in arbitration
or joinder or consolidation of claims in court or in arbitration with other persons, are
permitted without the consent of HSBC and me. The validity and effect of the preceding
sentence (herein referred to as the  Class Action Waiver Provision ) shall be determined
exclusively by a court and not by the Administrator or any arbitrator. Neither the
Administrator nor any arbitrator shall have the power or authority to 

3

waive, modify or fail to enforce the Class Action Waiver Provision, and any attempt to
do so, whether by role, policy, arbitration decision or otherwise, shall be invalid and
unenforceable. 

Any arbitration hearing that I attend will take place in a location that is reasonably convenient
for me: On any Claim I file, I will pay the first $50.00 of the filing fee. At my request, HSBC
will pay the remainder of the filing fee and any administrative or hearing fees charged by the
Administrator, up to $1,500.00 on any Claim asserted by me in the arbitration. If I should be
required to pay any additional fees to the Administrator, HSBC will consider a request by me to pay
all or part of the additional fees; however, HSBC shall not be obligated to pay any additional fees
unless the arbitrator grants me an award. If the arbitrator grants an award in my favor, HSBC will
reimburse me for any additional fees paid or owed by me to the Administrator up to the amount of
the fees that would have been charged if the original Claim had been for the amount of the actual
award in my favor. If the arbitrator issues an award in HSBCs favor, I will not be required to
reimburse HSBC for any fees HSBC has previously paid to the Administrator or for which HSBC is
responsible. 

This Arbitration Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and
shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16 (the  FAA ), and not by
any state law concerning arbitration. The arbitrator shall follow and apply applicable substantive
law to the extent consistent with the FAA, statutes of limitation and claims of privilege and shall
be authorized to award all remedies permitted by applicable substantive law, including, without
limitation, compensatory, statutory and punitive damages, declaratory, injunctive and other
equitable relief and attorneys  fees and costs. The arbitrator will follow rules of procedure and
evidence consistent with the FAA, this Arbitration Provision and, to the extent consistent with
this Arbitration Provision, the Administrator s rules. Upon request of either party, the arbitrator
shall prepare a short reasoned written opinion supporting the arbitration award. Judgment upon the
award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator s award will be final and
binding except for: (a) any appeal right under the FAA; and (b) any appeal of Claims involving more
than $100,000. For such Claims, any party may appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel
appointed by the Administrator, which will reconsider de novo (i.e., in its entirety) any aspect or
all aspects of the initial award that is appealed. The panel s decision will be final and binding,
except for any appeal right under the FAA. Unless applicable law provides otherwise, the appealing
party will pay the appeal s costs (i.e., the amounts owed to the Administrator and the
arbitrators), regardless of its outcome. However, HSBC will consider in good faith any reasonable
request for HSBC to bear up to the full costs of the appeal. Nothing in this Arbitration Provision
shall be construed to prevent HSBC s use of offset or other contractual rights involving payment of
my income tax refund or other amount on deposit with HSBC to pay off any ERA, RAL, or similar
financial service, or BFC or other fees, now or thereafter owed by me to HSBC or any Other ERA or
RAL Lender or BFC or third party pursuant to the Documents or similar prior documents. 

I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, BUT I PREFER
TO RESOLVE ANY SUCH CLAIMS THROUGH ARBITRATION AND HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE MY
RIGHTS TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, UPON ELECTION OF ARBITRATION BY
HSBC OR BY ME. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO
PARTICIPATE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR
MEMBER OF ANY CLASS OR CLAIMANTS OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PERTAINING TO ANY CLAIM SUBJECT
TO ARBITRATION. I UNDERSTAND THAT, IF I AM A MEMBER OF THE PUTATIVE CLASS IN CUMMINS, ET AL. V.
H R BLOCK, ET AL., CASE NO. 03-C-134 IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF KANAWHA COUNTY, WV, THIS ARBITRATION
CLAUSE MAY NOT ACT AS A WAIVER OF THE RIGHTS AND CLAIMS I MAY HAVE IN THAT ACTION. 

This Arbitration Provision shall supersede any prior Arbitration Provisions contained in any
previous ERA application or related agreement and shall survive repayment of any ERA and
termination of my account; provided, however, that if I reject this Arbitration Provision as set
forth below, all prior Arbitration Provisions shall remain in full
force and effect. If any portion
of this Arbitration Provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the
remaining portions of this Arbitration Provision. However, if a determination is made that the
Class Action Waiver Provision is unenforceable, this Arbitration Provision (other than this
sentence) and any prior Arbitration Provision shall be null and void. 

To reject this Arbitration Provision, I must send HSBC, c/o HSBC Taxpayer Financial Services,
Account Research, P.O. Box 18097, Jacksonville, FL 32229, a signed writing ( Rejection Notice )
that is received within thirty (30) days after the date I submit this Application. The Rejection

security number and must be signed by all persons signing this Application as Applicant(s). I may
send the Rejection Notice in any manner I see fit as long as it is received at the specified
address within the specified time. No other methods can be used to reject the Arbitration
Agreement. If the 

4

Rejection Notice is sent
on my behalf by a third party, such third party must
include evidence of his or her authority to submit the Rejection Notice on my behalf. 

As used in this Arbitration Provision, the term  HSBC  shall mean HSBC Bank USA, N. A., HSBC
TFS, and H R
Block, Inc., and each of their parents, wholly or majority-owned subsidiaries, affiliates, or
predecessors, successors,
assigns and the franchisees of any of them, and each of their officers, directors, agents,

      INFORMATION.  

I understand and confirm that the name, home address, mailing address, social
security/taxpayer identification number, and date of birth which I entered into the
personal information and address sections of the professional tax service product are true
and correct and are incorporated in this Application by this reference as the name, home
address, mailing address, social security/taxpayer identification number, and date of birth
of each applicant.

       IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT . TO HELP

REQUIRES ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO OBTAIN, VERIFY, AND RECORD INFORMATION THAT IDENTIFIES
EACH PERSON WHO OPENS AN ACCOUNT. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR ME: WHEN I OPEN AN ACCOUNT, YOU WILL ASK
FOR MY NAME, ADDRESS, DATE OF BIRTH, AND OTHER INFORMATION THAT WILL
ALLOW YOU TO IDENTIFY ME.
YOU MAY ALSO SEEK TO VERIFY MY IDENTITY THROUGH NON-DOCUMENTARY METHODS. 

3. 
       
      Payment Instructions .

service product application during the Electronic Filing process, and I authorize HSBC to
direct deposit my funds to that designated account. 

B. 
       
     If my refund is greater than my ERA I understand I am to receive my excess proceeds via
direct deposit into the bank account that I previously designated on the direct deposit screen
and/or the express products screen of this professional tax service product application during
the electronic filing process, and I authorize HSBC to direct deposit my funds to those
designated accounts. 

4.  
       
      HSBC ERA DISCLOSURE STATEMENT:  

The FINANCE CHARGE for my ERA it set forth on my Truth in Lending Disclosure. I know that even if
my ERA is denied, I am responsible for my electronic filing, as applicable. I am also responsible
for the repayment of my ERA whether or not my tax refund is paid to my account with HSBC in whole
or in part. I understand that my income tax return can be filed electronically without obtaining
an ERA and, subject to IRS processing, the usual time within which I can expect to receive a refund
check if I file electronically and without an ERA is within approximately three weeks from the
date I file my return. The IRS normally makes an electronic deposit in an average of about 12 days
after an electronic filing. Alternatively, if I elect to obtain and am approved for an ERA, the loan
proceeds usually will be made available to me within approximately 1-2 days of my loan application. 

The usual duration of an ERA is approximately 11 days from the date of approval of the ERA. The
following are examples of the estimated ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE ( APR ) and ERA FINANCE CHARGES on
ERAs of varying amounts based on 1l-day maturity periods. Because the APR on an ERA may be high in
certain cases relative to other sources of credit, I understand that
it may cost less to use such
sources; e.g., credit cards, equity lines, etc., instead of an ERA. 

* 
       
      I understand I will be given disclosures which will show the actual finance charge and other
charges applicable to my ERA transaction.  e = estimate 

5. 
       
      Applicable Law . This Application and all the other documents executed in
connection with this Application or my ERA (collectively,  Documents ), shall be governed by
and construed, interpreted, and enforced in accordance with

federal law and, to the extent state law applies, the law of the state of Delaware (without
reference to conflict of laws principles). 

6. 
       
      Important Information About ERAs.  I understand that (a) I can file my federal
income tax return electronically without obtaining an ERA; (b) the IRS will send me a refund
check or electronically deposit my refund to my existing bank account; (c) the IRS normally
makes an electronic deposit in an average of about 12 days after an electronic filing; (d)
HSBC tries to initiate the direct deposit of proceeds of an ERA on the first business day
after application; (e) HSBC cannot guarantee when any proceeds of an ERA will be available to
me; and (f) a ERA may cost substantially more than another type of loan I might obtain. 

7. 
       
      Deposit Authorization.  (a) After I submit my Application, BFC will
electronically transmit my tax return to the IRS and my Application to HSBC. I understand that
I will authorize or agree to an IRS Transmittal Form 8453 or IRS e- file signature
authorization ( Deposit Authorization ) as part of my Application and electronic tax filing,
and that the Deposit Authorization and this Application provide an irrevocable agreement to
have my tax refund disbursed to HSBC, and irrevocably transfers to HSBC all my rights, title,
and interest in the proceeds of my tax refund for purposes of the ERA I have requested and
other purposes authorized by this Application. (b) If my Application is denied or cancelled,
and HSBC receives my tax refund, HSBC will forward to me promptly any proceeds of my refund
after deducting amounts permitted by this Agreement. (c) If for any reason, any part of the
anticipated tax refund is disallowed or offset by the IRS, or if  should receive a refund
check in the mail, I will advise HSBC immediately and promptly pay HSBC any amounts owing with
respect to my Application or an ERA, and pay BFC any fees owed to them involving my tax
return.  

8. 
       
      Refund Account . (a) I request that a deposit account be opened ( Refund Account )
at HSBC upon receipt of my tax refund for the purposes of ensuring the repayment of my ERA and
other amounts described in the Documents. The Annual Percentage Yield and interest rate on the
Refund Account will be 0%. This means I will not receive any interest on funds in the Refund
Account. I understand that I cannot make withdrawals from the Refund Account and that the funds
in the Refund Account will be disbursed only as expressly provided in
the Documents. (b) HSBC
may deduct any amounts I owe HSBC or BFC from my tax refund, any funds received in the Refund
Account, and any proceeds of an ERA. I am required to pay all fees to BFC for services
rendered by BFC when HSBC electronically transfers my proceeds to me. If an electronic
transfer of proceeds is not made available to me because I do not receive a tax refund, then I
am required to pay all fees to BFC for services rendered by BFC on demand. HSBC also may
withdraw amounts deposited into the Refund Account from my tax refund to disburse money to me
in accordance with my Application. (c) I will not receive a periodic statement for the Refund
Account, but I will receive notice if funds in the Refund Account are not sufficient to repay
my ERA or are used for any purpose other than repayment of my ERA or disbursement to me. HSBC
may, immediately after disbursement of all funds in the Refund Account, close the account
without further notice to or authorization from me. 

9. 
       
      Refund Account Fee.  I will pay HSBC a fee of $24.95
for the administration of the
Refund Account and any disbursements to me from that account
( Refund Account Fee ). I am
obligated to pay the Refund Account Fee after the Deposit Authorization is filed with the IRS
and is imposed regardless of whether (a) I apply for an ERA or (b) my Application is approved
or denied. The Refund Account Fee is not imposed directly or indirectly as an incident to or
condition of any extension of credit. I can avoid the Refund Account Fee if I direct that my
tax refund not be deposited to HSBC before filing my Deposit Authorization with the IRS. 

10. 
       
       Collections.  In consideration of the case and convenience of the
following method of paying any delinquent debt I owe or the other applicant owes to HSBC, HSBC
TFS, my electronic return originator ( ERO ) for prior years, BFC, or Bank One, River City
Bank, First Security Bank, Republic Bank or Santa Barbara Bank   Trust (the  Other ERA or RAL
Lenders ), and provided that such debt has not been discharged in bankruptcy, I authorize and
direct the repayment of such debt, calculated as of the date of my Application, by means of
(a) having such debt deducted from the proceeds of my ERA, or (b) having my request for an ERA
denied or the amount for which I have applied reduced and having such debt repaid to those
entities by offset or otherwise from my tax refund directly transmitted into my Refund Account
at HSBC. If I owe delinquent debt to more than one of the entities listed above, I authorize
and direct HSBC to pay such debts in the following order: HSBC, HSBC TFS, Other ERA or RAL

time the Claim is filed. I shall
have the right to select one of these arbitration administrators (the  Administrator ). The
arbitrator must be a lawyer with more than ten (10) years of experience or a retired or former
judge. In the event of a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the rules of the
Administrator, this Arbitration Provision shall govern. In the event of a conflict between
this Arbitration Provision and the balance of this Application or any other Documents, this
Arbitration Provision shall govern. Notwithstanding any language in this Arbitration Provision
to the contrary, no arbitration may be administered, without the consent of all parties to the
arbitration, by any organization that has in place a formal or informal policy that is
inconsistent with and purports to override the terms of this Arbitration Provision, including
the Class Action Waiver Provision defined below. 

HSBC hereby agrees not to invoke its right to arbitrate an individual Claim I may bring in
small claims court or an equivalent court, if any, so long as the Claim is pending only in
that court. No class actions or private attorney general actions in court or in arbitration
or joinder or consolidation of claims in court or in arbitration with other persons, are
permitted without the consent of HSBC and me. The validity and effect of the preceding
sentence (herein referred to as the  Class Action Waiver Provision ) shall be determined
exclusively by a court and not by the Administrator or any arbitrator. Neither the
Administrator nor any arbitrator shall have the power or authority to waive, modify or fail
to enforce the Class Action Waiver Provision, and any attempt to do so, whether by rule,
policy, arbitration decision or otherwise, shall be invalid and
unenforceable.  

Any arbitration hearing that I attend will take place in a location that is reasonably
convenient for me. On any Claim I file, I will pay the first $50.00 of the filing fee. At
my request, HSBC will pay the remainder of the filing fee and any administrative or hearing
fees charged by the Administrator, up to $1,500.00 on any Claim asserted by me in the
arbitration. If I should be required to pay any additional fees to the Administrator, HSBC
will consider a request by me to pay all or part of the additional fees; however, HSBC shall
not be obligated to pay any additional fees unless the arbitrator grants me an award. If
the arbitrator grants an award in my favor, HSBC will reimburse

3

me for any additional fees paid or owed by me to the Administrator up to the amount of the
fees that would have been charged if the original Claim had been for the amount of the
actual award in my favor. If the arbitrator issues an award in
HSBC s favor, I will not be
required to reimburse HSBC for any fees HSBC has previously paid to the Administrator or
for which HSBC is responsible. 

This Arbitration Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce,
and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16 (the  FAA ),
and not by any state law concerning arbitration. The arbitrator shall follow and apply
applicable substantive law to the extent consistent with the FAA, statutes of limitation
and claims of privilege and shall be authorized to award all remedies permitted by
applicable substantive law, including, without limitation, compensatory, statutory and
punitive damages, declaratory, injunctive and other equitable relief and attorneys  fees
and costs. The arbitrator will follow rules of procedure and evidence consistent with the
FAA, this Arbitration Provision and, to the extent consistent with this Arbitration
Provision, the Administrator s rules. Upon request of either party, the arbitrator shall
prepare a short reasoned written opinion supporting the arbitration award. Judgment upon
the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator s award will be
final and binding except for: (a) any appeal right under the FAA; and (b) any appeal of
Claims involving more than $100,000. For such Claims, any party may appeal the award to a
three-arbitrator panel appointed by the Administrator, which will reconsider de novo (i.e.,
in its entirety) any aspect or all aspects of the initial award that is appealed. The
panel s decision will be final and binding, except for any
appeal right under the FAA.
Unless applicable law provides otherwise, the appealing party will pay the appeal s costs
(i.e., the amounts owed to the Administrator and the arbitrators), regardless of its
outcome. However, HSBC will consider in good faith any reasonable request for HSBC to bear
up to the full costs of the appeal. Nothing in this Arbitration Provision shall be
construed to prevent HSBC s use of offset or other contractual rights involving payment of
my income tax refund or other amount on deposit with HSBC to pay off any ERA, RAL, or
similar financial service, or BFC or other fees, now or thereafter owed by me to HSBC or
any Other ERA or RAL Lender or BFC or third party pursuant to the Documents or similar
prior documents. 

I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, BUT I
PREFER TO RESOLVE ANY SUCH CLAIMS THROUGH ARBITRATION AND HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY
WAIVE MY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, UPON ELECTION OF
ARBITRATION BY HSBC OR BY ME. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE
AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF ANY CLASS OR CLAIMANTS OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL
PERTAINING TO ANY CLAIM SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION. I UNDERSTAND THAT, IF I AM A MEMBER OF THE
PUTATIVE CLASS IN CUMMINS, ET AL., V. H R BLOCK, ET AL., CASE NO. 03-C-134 IN THE CIRCUIT
COURT OF KANAWHA COUNTY, WV, THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE MAY NOT ACT AS A WAIVER OF THE RIGHTS
AND CLAIMS I MAY HAVE IN THAT ACTION. 

This Arbitration Provision shall supersede any prior Arbitration Provisions contained in
any previous ERA application or related agreement and shall survive repayment of any ERA
and termination of my account; provided, however, that if I reject this Arbitration
Provision as set forth below, all prior Arbitration Provisions shall remain in full force
and effect. If any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable,
it will not invalidate the remaining portions of this Arbitration Provision. However, if a
determination is made that the Class Action Waiver Provision is unenforceable, this
Arbitration Provision (other than this sentence) and any prior Arbitration Provision shall
be null and void. 

To reject this Arbitration Provision, I must send HSBC, c/o HSBC Taxpayer Financial
Services, Account Research, P.O. Box 18097, Jacksonville, FL 32229, a signed writing
( Rejection Notice ) that is received within thirty (30) days after the date I submit this

my name, address, and social security number and must be signed by all persons signing this
Application as Applicant(s). I may send the Rejection Notice in any manner I see fit as long
as it is received at the specified address within the specified time. No other methods can
be used to reject the Arbitration Agreement. If the Rejection Notice is sent on my behalf by
a third party, such third party must include evidence of his or her authority to submit the
Rejection Notice oh my behalf. 

As used in this Arbitration Provision, the term  HSBC  shall mean HSBC Bank USA, N. A.,
HSBC TFS, and H R Block, Inc., and each of their parents, wholly or majority-owned
subsidiaries, affiliates, or predecessors, successors, assigns and the franchisees of any
of them, and each of their officers, directors, agents, and employees.

mentioned in this Arbitration Provision or if I would like to obtain a copy of its
arbitration rules, I can contact the Administrator as follows: American Arbitration
Association, 335 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017,  www.adr.org;  National

HSBC TAXPAYER FINANCIAL SERVICES DIVISION OF HSBC BANK USA, NATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION 
Privacy Statement 

Applicability   This Privacy Statement only applies to customers  accounts with the HSBC Taxpayer
Financial Services division of HSBC Bank USA, National Association ( HSBC ). All other HSBC
accounts are governed by the HSBC Bank USA National Association Personal Banking Policy.

Introduction   Our Commitment to You   HSBC is proud to be part of a financial services organization
that has been providing superior products and services to its customers for many years. We greatly
appreciate the trust that you and millions of customers have placed in us, and we will protect that
trust by continuing to respect the privacy of all our applicants and customers even if our formal
customer relationship ends.

How We Handle Information we Obtain   It is important for you to know that in order to ensure that
our customers get the very best service and the highest quality products, HSBC collects demographic
information (like your name and address) and credit information (like information related to your
accounts with us and others). This information comes either directly from you, for instance, from
your application and transactions on your account; or, it may come from an outside source such as
your credit bureau report. In addition, if you visit our Internet web site, we may collect certain
information about your Internet usage.

Because some of the information we gather is not publicly available, we take great care to ensure
that this information is kept safe from unauthorized access, and we would never share the
information in violation of any regulation or law. Because we respect your privacy and we value
your trust, the only employees or companies who can access your private personal information are
those who use it to service your account or provide services to you or to us. HSBC diligently
maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable federal
standards to guard your private personal information and to assist us in preventing unauthorized
access to that information.

How We Share Information with Companies Affiliated with Us   From time to time, for general business
purposes such as fraud control, or when we think it may benefit you, we do share certain
information with our affiliated companies, except as prohibited by applicable law. These affiliated
companies all provide financial services, such as banking, consumer finance, insurance, mortgage,
and brokerage services. Some examples include companies doing business under the names Household,
Beneficial, or HSBC. We may also share certain information with non-financial service providers
that become affiliated with us in the future (such as travel, auto, or shopping clubs), except as
prohibited by applicable law. The information we share might come from your application, for
instance your name, address, telephone number, social security number, and e-mail address. Also,
the information we share could include your transactions with us or our affiliated companies (such
as your account balance, payment history, and parties to the transaction), your Internet usage, or
your credit card usage. Except for Vermont residents, the information we share could also include
your assets, income, or credit reports.

How We Share Information under a Joint Marketing Agreement   We may also provide information to
non-affiliated financial companies (such as a tax preparer, mortgage banker or insurance service
provider) with whom we have a joint marketing agreement. The sharing of information with these
types of companies is permitted by law. The information we may share also comes from the sources
described above and might include your name, address, phone number, and account experience with us.

How We Share Information with Other Third Parties   Except for California or Vermont residents, we
also may share information with non-affiliated companies that are able to extend special offers we
feel might be of value to you. These companies may be financial services providers (such as
mortgage bankers or insurance agents) or they may be non-financial companies (such as retailers,
tax preparers, or marketing companies). These offers are typically for products and services that
you might not otherwise hear about. The information we may provide them comes from the sources
described above and might include your name, address and phone number. You may tell us not to share
information with non-affiliated companies in this way by completing the form below. For California
and Vermont residents, applicable law requires us to obtain your permission in order to share
information about you in this way, and we have chosen not to share your information in this way.

We may also provide information to non-affiliated companies that perform operational, collection,
or fraud control services related to your account. The sharing of information with these types of
companies is permitted by law. Such a company might include a financial company (such as an
insurance service provider) or a non-financial company (such as a data processor or internet
service provider) with whom we have an agreement. The information

7

we may
share also comes from the sources described above and might include your name, address, phone
number, and account experience with us.

Finally, we provide information about you to non-affiliated companies such as credit reporting
agencies and companies which provide services related to your account. This information sharing is
also permitted by law.

We reserve the right to change our privacy practices at any time in accordance with applicable law.
Notice of such changes will be provided if required by applicable law.

How to Opt-Out (non-affiliated companies) (Applicable to residents of all states except California
and Vermont)   If you do not want us to share your private information with non-affiliated companies
(unless we are permitted or required by law to do so), please let us know by simply calling
1-800-365-2641. If you have previously informed us of your preference, you do not need to do so
again. We will be happy to comply with your  opt-out  request, which will only apply to the HSBC

joint account will apply to all parties on the joint account. Opt-out requests will not apply to
information sharing that is permitted by law. Please allow sufficient time for us to process your
request.

Loan Agreement  

1.  Obligation on ERA .

(a) I am obligated, on the date I agree to this Agreement, to accept an ERA if HSBC approves my
application, unless HSBC approves me for a smaller ERA than the amount set forth in the Total of
Payments section in the TILA Disclosure Statement above. If I am approved for a smaller ERA, I will
be provided with a replacement TILA Disclosure Statement and I will be obligated to accept the
smaller ERA if I accept the ERA proceeds. My loan will begin, and HSBC will earn the finance
charge, when I am approved for the ERA and a transfer is initiated to my bank account.

(b) I may cancel my ERA transaction, or my obligation to accept a ERA, for up to 48 hours after I
become obligated to accept the ERA. To do so, I must return to HSBC cash in the amount of the ERA
proceeds and comply with other requirements set by HSBC. I must call the customer service number
(1-800-524-0628) for further instructions on how to return the ERA proceeds to HSBC. I understand
that, if I use my right to cancel, my finance charge will be refunded to me, HSBC will provide me
with any tax refund only after HSBC receives the refund from the IRS, and I must still pay a Refund
Account Fee.

2.  Security Interest . If I receive a ERA, I grant HSBC a security interest in the property
described in the TILA Disclosure Statement as collateral for my obligations to repay the ERA and
perform my other obligations under the Application and this Agreement.

3.  Deductions . My Prepaid Finance Charge and Refund Account Fee shall be deducted from the
proceeds of my ERA.

4.
 Other Charges . (a) I agree to pay a returned check charge of $ 19 if any check or
similar instrument I give HSBC is not honored. (b) I agree to pay a late charge as described in the
TILA Disclosure Statement if I do not repay my loan when due. (c) In the event that I pay my
account by telephone, I agree to pay up to a $10 fee for each such payment HSBC reserves the right
to change this fee from time to time. I may call Customer Service for a current

2

fee schedule. (d) I also agree to pay any attorney s fees and collection agency costs incurred by
HSBC or its affiliates to collect any delinquent ERA as permitted by law.

5.  Application of Payments . Each payment I make on the ERA will be applied in any order
determined by HSBC.

      IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT . TO HELP THE
GOVERNMENT FIGHT THE FUNDING OF TERRORISM AND MONEY LAUNDERING ACTIVITIES, FEDERAL LAW
REQUIRES ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO OBTAIN, VERIFY, AND RECORD INFORMATION THAT IDENTIFIES
EACH PERSON WHO OPENS AN ACCOUNT. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR ME: WHEN I OPEN AN ACCOUNT, YOU WILL ASK
FOR MY NAME, ADDRESS, DATE OF BIRTH, AND OTHER INFORMATION THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO IDENTIFY ME.
YOU MAY ALSO SEEK TO VERIFY MY IDENTITY THROUGH NON-DOCUMENTARY METHODS.

       Payment Instructions   

A. 
       
     If I receive an ERA, I understand I am to receive my ERA proceeds via direct deposit
into the bank account that I will designate on the Direct Deposit screen of this software
application during the Electronic Filing process, and I authorize HSBC to direct deposit
my funds to that designated account. 

B. 
       
     If my refund is greater than my ERA, I understand I am to receive my excess funds via
direct deposit into the bank account that I previously designated on the Direct Deposit
screen of this software application and I authorize HSBC to direct deposit my funds to
that designated account. 

4. 
       
      HSBC ERA DISCLOSURE STATEMENT:  

The FINANCE CHARGE for my ERA is set forth on my Truth In
Lending Disclosure. I know that even if
my ERA is denied, I am responsible for my electronic filing, as applicable. I am also responsible
for the repayment of my ERA whether or not my tax refund is paid to my account with HSBC in whole
or in part. I understand that my income tax return can be filed electronically without obtaining in
ERA and, subject to
IRS processing, the usual time within which I can expect to receive a
refund check if I file
electronically and without an ERA is within approximately three weeks from the date I file my
return. The IRS normally makes an electronic deposit in an average of about 12 days after an
electronic filing. Alternatively, if I elect to obtain and am
approved for an ERA, the loan
proceeds usually will be made available to me within approximately 1-2 days of my loan application. 

The usual   duration of an ERA is approximately 11 days from the date of approval of the
ERA. The following are examples of the estimated ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE ( APR ) and ERA FINANCE
CHARGES on ERAs of varying amounts based on 11-day maturity periods. Because the APR on an ERA may
be high in certain cases relative to other sources of credit, I
understand that it may cost less to
use such sources; e.g.,
credit cards, equity lines, etc., instead of an ERA. 

* 
       
      I understand I will be given disclosures which will show the actual finance charge and other
charges applicable to my ERA transaction.  

e = estimate  

5. 
       
      Applicable Law . This Application and all the other documents executed in connection
with this Application or my ERA (collectively,  Documents ), shall be governed by and
construed, interpreted, and enforced in accordance with federal law and, to the extent state
law applies, the law of the state of Delaware (without reference to conflict of laws
principles). 

6. 
       
      Important Information About ERAs . I understand that: (a )  I can file my federal income
tax return electronically I without obtaining an ERA; (b) the IRS will send me a refund check
or electronically deposit my refund to my existing bank account; (c) the IRS normally makes an
electronic deposit in an average of about 12 days after an electronic filing; (d) HSBC tries
to initiate the direct deposit of proceeds of an ERA on the first business day after
application; (e) HSBC cannot guarantee when any proceeds of an ERA will be available to me;
and (f) a ERA may cost substantially more than another type of loan I might obtain. 

7. 
       
      Deposit Authorization . (a) After I submit my Application, BFC will
electronically transmit my tax return to the IRS and my Application
to HSBC. I understand
that I will authorize or agree to an IRS Transmittal Form 8453
or IRS e-file signature
authorization ( Deposit Authorization ) as part of my Application and electronic tax
filing, and that the Deposit Authorization and this Application provide an irrevocable
agreement to have my tax refund disbursed to HSBC, and irrevocably transfers to HSBC all
my rights, title, and interest in the proceeds of my tax refund for purposes of the ERA
I have requested and other purposes authorized by this Application. (b) If my Application
is denied or cancelled, and HSBC receives my tax refund, HSBC will forward to me promptly
my proceeds of my refund after deducting amounts permitted by this
Agreement. (c) If for
any reason, any part of the anticipated tax refund is disallowed or offset by the IRS,
or if I should receive a refund check in the mail, I will advise HSBC immediately and
promptly pay HSBC any amounts owing with respect to my Application or an ERA, and pay BFC
any fees owed to them involving my tax return. 

8. 
       
      Refund Account . (a) I request that a deposit account be
opened ( Refund Account ) at HSBC upon receipt of my tax refund for the purposes
of ensuring the repayment of my ERA and other amounts described in the Documents.
The Annual Percentage Yield and interest rate on the Refund Account will be 0%.
This means I will not receive any interest on funds in the Refund Account. 1
understand that I cannot make withdrawals from the Refund Account and that the
funds in the Refund Account will be disbursed only as expressly provided in the
Documents. (b) HSBC may deduct any amounts I
owe HSBC or BFC from my tax refund, any funds received in the Refund Account,
and any proceeds of an ERA. I am required to pay all fees to BFC for services
rendered by BFC when HSBC electronically transfers my proceeds to me. If an
electronic transfer of proceeds is not made available to me because I do not
receive a tax refund, then I am required to pay all fees to BFC for services
rendered by BFC on demand. HSBC also may withdraw amounts deposited into the
Refund Account from my tax refund to disburse money to me in accordance with my
Application. (c) I will not receive a periodic statement for the Refund Account,
but I will receive notice if funds in the Refund Account are not sufficient to
repay my ERA or are used for any purpose other than repayment of my ERA or
disbursement to me. HSBC may, immediately after disbursement of all funds in the
Refund Account, close the account without further notice to or authorization
from me. 

9. 
       
      Refund Account Fee . I will pay HSBC a fee of $11.95 for the
administration of the Refund Account and any disbursements to me from that
account ( Refund Account Fee ). I am obligated to pay the Refund Account Fee after
the Deposit Authorization is filed with the IRS and is imposed regardless of
whether (a) I apply for an ERA or (b) my Application is approved or denied. The
Refund Account Fee is not imposed directly or indirectly as an incident to or
condition of any extension of credit. I can avoid the Refund Account Fee if I
direct that my tax refund not be deposited to HSBC before filing my Deposit
Authorization with the IRS. 

10. 
       
       Collections . In consideration of the ease and
convenience of the following method of paying any delinquent debt I owe or the
other applicant owes to HSBC, HSBC TFS, my electronic return originator ( ERO )
for prior years, BFC, or Bank One, River City Bank, First Security Bank, Republic
Bank or Santa Barbara Bank   Trust (the  Other ERA or RAL Lenders ), and provided
that such debt has not been discharged in bankruptcy, I authorize and direct the
repayment of such debt, calculated as of the date of my Application, by means of
(a) having such debt deducted from the proceeds of my ERA, or (b) having my
request for an ERA denied or the amount for which I have applied reduced and
having such debt repaid to those entities by offset or otherwise from my tax
refund directly transmitted into my Refund Account at HSBC. If I owe delinquent
debt to more than one of the entities listed above, I authorize and direct HSBC to
pay such debts in the following order: HSBC, HSBC TFS, Other ERA or RAL Lenders,
ERO, and BFC. 1 also authorize and instruct HSBC and the Other ERA or RAL Lenders
to disclose to each other information about their  

2

respective credit experiences concerning my present and prior ERAs, refund
anticipation loans ( RALs ), or similar financial services, and my prior tax
returns. 

PLEASE NOTE: If I have delinquent debt, I understand that HSBC or HSBC TFS may be acting as a debt
collector hereunder to collect a debt and that any information obtained will be used for that
purpose.

11. 
       
      No Fiduciary/Agency Duty . I understand that BFC is not acting
in a fiduciary, confidential, or agency capacity with respect to me in connection
with this transaction and has no other duties to me beyond the transmission of ray
tax return information to HSBC, and the electronic filing of my tax return with
the IRS and/or state taxing authority. I understand that BFC or an affiliate of
BFC may has the right to purchase an interest in my ERA issued by
HSBC. I further
understand that BFC or an affiliate of BFC may receive payments from HSBC or its
affiliates in connection with ERAs. I also understand that HSBC is not acting in a
fiduciary, confidential, or agency capacity with respect to me in connection with
this transaction. 

12. 
       
      Disclosure Information . (a)  Information  means my federal
and state income tax returns for the tax year 2004, any information obtained in
connection with my tax return (including information relating to a possible offset
of my tax refund or the possibility that my tax return is incorrect), and any
information relating to my Application for an ERA or similar financial service I
have received or requested from HSBC. (b)  Authorized Parties  means HSBC, HSBC
TFS, BFC, my Transmitter, and their respective affiliates and agents, and includes
the Fraud Service Bureau operated for HSBC. (c) The Authorized Parties may share
Information to process my Application, to provide ERAs to me, to collect
delinquent ERAs or BFC fees, to prevent fraud, and to otherwise administer or
promote the program for ERAs. (d) The Authorized Parties may disclose Information
to the IRS, state tax agencies and other financial institutions that provide ERAs
or other financial services, (e) The Authorized Parties may call, or input my
Information on any website of, the IRS or state tax agencies in connection with my
Application to, among other things, determine the status of my tax return. The IRS
and state tax agencies may disclose information about me and my tax returns to the
Authorized Parties. (f) BFC may not use or disclose Information for any purpose,
except as permitted under Treas. Reg. See. 301.7216-2 or as provided herein. (f) I
consent to HSBC sharing information as provided in the Privacy Policy set forth in
Section 18. 

13. 
       
      Service Fees . (a) Reissued Check Fee: I agree to pay $10 each
time that a check is reissued at my request for any reason. If I request that such
a check be sent by overnight mail, I agree to pay the charges for sending it by
overnight mail, (b) Document Fee: If I ask for a copy of my Application, loan
agreement, billing statement or other document, I may be charged $10 per document. 

14. 
       
      Arbitration Provision . Any claim, dispute or controversy
between me and HSBC (as specifically defined below for purposes of this
Arbitration Provision), whether in contract or tort (intentional or otherwise),
whether pre-existing, present or future, and including constitutional, statutory,
common law, regulatory, and equitable claims in any way relating to (a) any of
these or any other Documents or any ERA that I have previously requested or
received from HSBC, (b) advertisements, promotions, or oral or written statements
related to this or any other Application for a RAL or any ERA that I have
previously requested or received from HSBC, (c) the relationship of HSBC and me
relating to any of these or any other Documents or any ERA that I have previously
requested or received from HSBC; and (d) except as provided below, the validity,
enforceability or scope of this Arbitration Provision or any part thereof,
including, but not limited to, the issue whether any particular claim, dispute or
controversy must be submitted to arbitration (collectively the  Claim ), shall be
resolved, upon the election of either me or HSBC, by binding arbitration pursuant
to this Arbitration Provision and the applicable rules of the American Arbitration
Association ( AAA ) or the National Arbitration Forum ( NAF ) in effect at the
time the Claim is filed. I shall have the right to select one of these arbitration
administrators (the  Administrator ). The arbitrator must be a lawyer with more
than ten (10) years of experience or a retired or former judge. In the event of a
conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the rules of the Administrator,
this Arbitration Provision shall govern. In the event of a conflict between this
Arbitration Provision and the balance of this Application or any other Documents,
this Arbitration Provision shall govern. Notwithstanding any language in this
Arbitration Provision to the contrary, no arbitration may be administered, without
the consent of all parties to the arbitration, by any organization that has in
place a formal or informal policy that is inconsistent with and purports to
override the terms of this Arbitration Provision, including the Class Action
Waiver Provision defined below. 

HSBC hereby agrees not to invoke its right to arbitrate an individual Claim I may
bring in small claims court or an equivalent court, if any, so long as the Claim
is pending only in that court. No class actions or private attorney general actions in
court or in arbitration or joinder or consolidation of claims in court or in
arbitration with other 

3

persons, are permitted without the consent of HSBC and me. The validity and effect of the preceding
sentence (herein referred to as the  Class Action Waiver Provision ) shall be determined
exclusively by a court and not by the Administrator or any arbitrator. Neither the Administrator
nor any arbitrator shall have the power or authority to waive, modify or fail to enforce the Class
Action Waiver Provision, and any attempt to do so, whether by rule, policy, arbitration decision or
otherwise, shall be invalid and unenforceable. 

Any arbitration bearing that I attend will take place in a location that is reasonably convenient
for me. On any Claim I file, 1 will pay the first $50.00 of the filing fee. At my request, HSBC
will pay the remainder of the filing fee and any administrative or hearing fees charged by the
Administrator, up to $ 1,500.00 on any Claim asserted by me in the arbitration. If I should be
required to pay any additional fees to the Administrator, HSBC will consider a request by me to pay
all or part of the additional fees; however, HSBC shall not be obligated to pay any additional fees
unless the arbitrator grants me an award. If the arbitrator grants an award in my favor, HSBC will
reimburse me for any additional fees paid or owed by me to the Administrator up to the amount of
the fees that would have been charged if the original Claim had been for the amount of the actual
award in my favor. If the arbitrator issues an award in HSBC s favor, I will not be required to
reimburse HSBC for any fees HSBC has previously paid to the Administrator or for which HSBC is
responsible. 

This Arbitration Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and
shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16 (the  FAA ), and not by
any state law concerning arbitration. The arbitrator shall follow and apply applicable substantive
law to the extent consistent with the FAA, statutes of limitation and claims of privilege and shall
be authorized to award all remedies permitted by applicable substantive law, including, without
limitation, compensatory, statutory and punitive damages, declaratory, injunctive and other
equitable relief and attorneys  fees and costs. The arbitrator will follow rules of procedure and
evidence consistent with the FAA, this Arbitration Provision and, to the extent consistent with
this Arbitration Provision, the Administrator s rules. Upon request of either party, the arbitrator
shall prepare a short reasoned written opinion supporting the arbitration award. Judgment upon the
award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator s award will be final and
binding except for: (a) any appeal right under the FAA; and (b) any appeal of Claims involving more
than $100,000. For such Claims, any party may appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel
appointed by the Administrator, which will reconsider de novo (i.e., in its entirety) any aspect
or all aspects of the initial award that is appealed. The panel s decision will be final and
binding, except for any appeal right under the FAA. Unless applicable law provides otherwise, the
appealing party will pay the appeal s costs (i.e., the amounts owed to the Administrator and the
arbitrators), regardless of its outcome. However, HSBC will consider in good faith any reasonable
request for HSBC to bear up to the full costs of the appeal. Nothing in this Arbitration Provision
shall be construed to prevent HSBC s use of offset or other contractual rights involving payment of
my income tax refund or other amount on deposit with HSBC to pay off any ERA, RAL, or similar
financial service, or BFC or other fees, now or thereafter owed by me to HSBC or any Other ERA or
RAL Lender or BFC or third party pursuant to the Documents or similar prior documents. 

I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, BUT I PREFER
TO RESOLVE ANY SUCH CLAIMS THROUGH ARBITRATION AND HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE MY RIGHTS
TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, UPON ELECTION OF ARBITRATION BY HSBC OR BY
ME. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF
ANY CLASS OR CLAIMANTS OR AS A PRIVATE
ATTORNEY GENERAL PERTAINING TO ANY CLAIM SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION. I UNDERSTAND THAT, IF I AM A
MEMBER OF THE PUTATIVE CLASS IN CUMMINS, ET AL. V. H R BLOCK, ET AL., CASE NO. 03-C-134 IN THE
CIRCUIT COURT OF KANAWHA COUNTY, WV, THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE MAY NOT ACT AS A WAIVER OF THE RIGHTS
AND CLAIMS I MAY HAVE IN THAT ACTION. 

This Arbitration Provision shall supersede any prior Arbitration Provisions contained in any
previous ERA application or related agreement and shall survive repayment of any ERA and
termination of my account; provided, however, that if I reject this Arbitration Provision as set
forth below, all prior Arbitration Provisions shall remain in full force and effect, If any portion
of this Arbitration Provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the
remaining portions of this Arbitration Provision. However, if a determination is made that the
Class Action Waiver Provision is unenforceable, this Arbitration Provision (other than this
sentence) and any prior Arbitration Provision shall be null and void. 

To reject this Arbitration Provision, I must send HSBC, c/o HSBC Taxpayer Financial Services,
Account Research, P.O. Box 18097, Jacksonville, FL 32229, a signed writing ( Rejection Notice )
that is received within thirty (30) days after the date I submit this Application. The Rejection

behalf.

or predecessors, successors, assigns and the franchisees of any of them, and each of their
officers, directors, agents, and employees.

HSBC TAXPAYER FINANCIAL SERVICES DIVISION OF HSBC BANK USA, NATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION 
Privacy Statement 

Applicability 

This Privacy Statement only applies to customers  accounts with the HSBC Taxpayer Financial
Services division of HSBC Bank USA, National Association
( HSBC ). All other HSBC accounts are
governed by the HSBC Bank USA National Association Personal Banking Policy.

Introduction
  Our Commitment to You 

HSBC is proud to be part of a financial services organization that has been providing superior
products and services to its customers for many years. We greatly appreciate the trust that you and
millions of customers have placed in us, and we will protect that trust by continuing to respect
the privacy of all our applicants and customers even if our formal customer relationship ends.

How We Handle Information we Obtain 

It is important for you to know that in order to ensure that our customers get the very best
service and the highest quality products, HSBC collects demographic information (like your name and
address) and credit information (like information related to your accounts with us and others).
This information comes either directly from you, for instance, from your application and
transactions on your account; or, it may come from an outside source such as your credit bureau
report. In addition, if you visit our Internet web site, we may collect certain information about
your Internet usage.

Because some of the information we gather is not publicly available, we take great care to ensure
that this information is kept safe from unauthorized access, and we would never share the
information in violation of any regulation or law. Because we respect your privacy and we value
your trust, the only employees or
companies who can access your private personal information are those who use it to service your
account or provide services to you or to us. HSBC diligently maintains physical, electronic and
procedural safeguards that comply with applicable federal standards to guard your private personal
information and to assist us in preventing unauthorized access to that information.

How We Share Information with Companies Affiliated with Us 

From time to time, for general business purposes such as fraud control, or when we think it may
benefit you, we do share certain information with our affiliated companies, except as prohibited by
applicable law. These affiliated companies all provide financial services, such as banking,
consumer finance, insurance, mortgage, and brokerage services. Some examples include companies
doing business under the names Household, Beneficial, or HSBC. We may also share certain
information with non-financial service providers that become affiliated with us in the future (such
as travel, auto, or shopping clubs), except as prohibited by applicable law. The information we
share might come from your application, for instance your name, address, telephone number, social
security number, and e-mail address. Also, the information we share could include your transactions
with us or our affiliated companies (such as your account balance, payment history, and parties to
the transaction), your Internet usage, or your credit card usage. Except for Vermont residents, the
information we share could also include your assets, income, or credit reports.

How We Share Information under a Joint Marketing Agreement 

We may also provide information to non-affiliated financial companies (such as a tax preparer,

each of the Loans, and contribute to the capital stock of the Issuer the balance of each of the

precedent set forth in  Section 2.06  hereof and in accordance with the procedures set forth
in  Section 2.01(c) , the Depositor, pursuant to an S SA Assignment, will assign to the

Estate or under any agreement or instrument relating thereto except as specifically set forth
herein.

(b) As of the Closing Date and as of each Transfer Date, the Issuer acknowledges (or
will acknowledge, pursuant to the S SA Assignment) the conveyance to it of the Trust Estate,

may, at its sole option, from time to time request advances on any Transfer Date of Additional Note

precedent to the purchase of Additional Note Principal Balances set forth in Section 3.01 of the
Note Purchase Agreement have not been fulfilled.

(iii) The Servicer shall appropriately note such Additional Note Principal Balance
(and the increased Note Principal Balance) in the next succeeding Payment Statement; provided,
however, that failure to make any such notation in such Payment Statement or any error in such
notation

25

shall not adversely affect any Noteholder s rights with respect to its Note Principal Balance
and its right to receive interest and principal payments in respect of the Note Principal Balance
held by such Noteholder. Each Noteholder shall record on the schedule attached to such Noteholder s
Note, the date and amount of any Additional Note Principal Balance advanced by it; provided, that
failure to make such recordation on such schedule or any error in such schedule shall not adversely
affect any Noteholder s rights with respect to its Note Principal Balance and its right to receive
interest payments in respect of the Note Principal Balance held by such Noteholder.

as contemplated in Section 2.05 hereof.

Section 2.03    Books and Records Intention of the Parties.  

(a) As of each Transfer Date, the sale of each of the Loans conveyed by the
Depositor on such Transfer Date shall be reflected on the balance sheets and other financial
statements of the Depositor and the Loan Originator, as the case may be, as a sale of assets and a

of the Servicer and the Custodian shall be responsible for maintaining, and shall maintain, a
complete set of books and records for each Loan which shall be clearly marked to reflect the
ownership of each Loan as of the related Transfer Date, by the Issuer and for the benefit of the
Securityholders.

(b) It is the intention of the parties hereto that, other than for federal, state
and local income or franchise tax purposes (as to which no treatment is herein contemplated), the
transfers and assignments of the Trust Estate on the initial Closing Date, on each Transfer Date
and as otherwise contemplated by the Basic Documents and the Assignments shall constitute a sale of
the Trust Estate including, without limitation, the Loans and all other property comprising the
Trust Estate specified in
 Section 2.01(a)  hereof, from the Depositor to the Issuer and such property shall not
be property of the Depositor. The parties hereto shall treat the Notes as indebtedness for federal,
state and local income and franchise tax purposes.

(c) Each transfer and assignment contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a
sale in part, and a contribution to capital in part, of the Loans from the Depositor to the Issuer.
Upon the consummation of those transactions the Loans shall be owned by and be the property of the
Issuer, and not owned by or otherwise the property of, the Depositor for any purpose including
without limitation any bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency, liquidation, conservatorship or
similar proceeding relating to either the Depositor or the Issuer or any property of either. The
parties hereto hereby acknowledge that the Issuer and its creditors are relying, and its subsequent
transferees and their creditors will rely, on such sales and contributions being recognized as
such. If (A) any transfer and assignment contemplated hereby is subsequently determined for any
reason under any circumstances to constitute a transfer to secure a loan rather than a sale in
part, and a contribution in part, of the Loans or (B) any Loan is otherwise held to be property of
the Depositor, then this Agreement (i) is and shall be a security agreement within the

26

meaning of Articles 8 and 9 of the applicable Uniform Commercial Code and (ii) shall

that materially and adversely affects the value of any Loan or the interests of the Securityholders
in any Loan or in the Securities, the party discovering such breach shall give prompt written
notice (but in no event later than two (2) Business Days following such discovery) to the other
parties. The obligations of the Loan Originator set forth in  Sections 2.05  and  3.06 
hereof to cure any breach or to substitute for or repurchase an affected Loan shall constitute the
sole remedies available hereunder to the Securityholders, the Depositor, the Servicer, the
Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee or the Issuer respecting a breach of the representations and
warranties contained in this Section 3.02. The fact that the Noteholder Agent or any Noteholder has
conducted or has failed to conduct any partial or complete due diligence investigation of the Loan
Files shall not affect the Securityholders  rights to demand repurchase or substitution as provided
under this Agreement.

the performance of its duties under any Basic Document to which it is a party;

(e) There are no actions or proceedings against, or investigations of, the Servicer
currently pending with regard to which the Servicer has received service of process and no action

preventing its entering into any Basic Document to which it is a party, (B) that seeks to prevent
the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by any Basic Document to which it is a
party, (C) that if determined adversely to the Servicer, would reasonably be expected to prohibit

omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. All written information furnished after
the date hereof by or on behalf of the Servicer to the Majority Noteholders in connection with the
Basic Documents to which it is a party and the transactions contemplated thereby will be true,
complete and accurate in every material respect, or (in the case of projections) based on

the Securityholders, the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee and the Issuer. Upon discovery by the

Section 3.04    Reserved   . 

Section 3.05    Representations and Warranties Regarding Loans   .  The Loan Originator
makes each of the representations and warranties set forth on  Exhibit F  hereto with respect
to each Loan, provided, however, that with respect to each Loan proposed to be transferred to the
Issuer by a QSPE Affiliate, to the extent that the Loan Originator has at the time of such transfer
actual knowledge of any facts or circumstances that would render any of such representations or
warranties materially false, the Loan Originator shall notify the Noteholder Agent of such facts or
circumstances and, in such event, shall have no obligation to make such materially false
representation and warranty and the Issuer shall not purchase such Loan. In addition, the Loan
Originator represents and warrants with respect to each Loan sold by a QSPE Affiliate that the Loan
Originator has not been required to pay any amount to or on behalf of such QSPE Affiliate that
lowered the recourse to the Loan Originator available to such QSPE Affiliate below the maximum
recourse to the Loan Originator available to such QSPE Affiliate under the terms of any loan
purchase agreement providing for recourse by that QSPE Affiliate to the Loan Originator.

Section 3.06    Purchase and Substitution   . 

(a) It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties set forth in
Exhibit F hereto shall survive the conveyance of the Loans to the Indenture Trustee on behalf of
the Issuer, and the delivery of the Securities to the Securityholders. Upon discovery by the
Depositor, the Servicer, the Loan Originator, the Custodian, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the
Owner Trustee or any Securityholder of a breach of any of such representations and warranties or
the representations and warranties of the Depositor, Loan Originator or Servicer set forth in
 Sections 3.01 ,  3.02  or  3.03 , respectively, which materially and adversely
affects the value or enforceability of any Loan or the interests of the Securityholders in any Loan
(notwithstanding that such representation and warranty was made to the Depositor s, Loan
Originator s or Servicer s best knowledge) or which, constitutes a breach of the representations
and warranties set forth in  Exhibit F , the party discovering such breach shall give prompt
written notice (but in no event later than two (2) Business Days following such discovery) to the
others. The Depositor, Loan Originator or Servicer, as applicable, shall, within five (5) Business
Days of

38

the earlier of the Depositor s, Loan Originator s or Servicer s discovery or the Depositor s,
Loan Originator s or Servicer s receiving notice of any breach of a representation or warranty,
promptly cure such breach in all material respects. If within five (5) Business Days after the
earlier of the Depositor s, Loan Originator s or Servicer s discovery of such breach or the
Depositor s, Loan Originator s or Servicer s receiving notice thereof such breach has not been
remedied by the Depositor, Loan Originator or Servicer, as applicable, and such breach materially
and adversely affects the interests of the Securityholders in the related Loan (an   Unqualified
Loan  ), the Loan Originator shall, promptly upon receipt of written instructions from the
Majority Noteholders, either (i) remove such Unqualified Loan (in which case it shall become a
Deleted Loan) from the Trust and substitute one or more Qualified Substitute Loans (in place of a
Deleted Loan) in the manner and subject to the conditions set forth in this  Section 3.06  or
(ii) purchase such Unqualified Loan at a purchase price equal to the Repurchase Price with respect
to such Unqualified Loan by depositing or causing to be deposited such Repurchase Price in the
Collection Account.

Any substitution of Loans pursuant to this  Section 3.06(a)  shall be accompanied by
payment by the Loan Originator of the Substitution Adjustment, if any, (x) if no
Overcollateralization Shortfall exists on the date of such substitution (after giving effect to
such substitution), remitted to the Noteholders in accordance with  Section 5.01(c)(4)(i)  or
(y) otherwise to be deposited in the Collection Account pursuant to  Section 5.01(b)  hereof.

(b) As to any Deleted Loan for which the Loan Originator substitutes a Qualified
Substitute Loan or Loans, the Loan Originator shall effect such substitution by delivering to the
Indenture Trustee and the Noteholder Agent a certification executed by a Responsible Officer of the
Loan Originator to the effect that the Substitution Adjustment, if any, has been (x) if no
Overcollateralization Shortfall exists on the date of such substitution (after giving effect to
such substitution), remitted to the Noteholders in accordance with Section  5.01(c)(4)(i) ,
or (y) otherwise deposited in the Collection Account. As to any Deleted Loan for which the Loan
Originator substitutes a Qualified Substitute Loan or Loans, the Loan Originator shall effect such
substitution by delivering to the Custodian the documents constituting the Custodial Loan File for
such Qualified Substitute Loan or Loans.

The Servicer shall deposit in the Collection Account all payments received in connection with
each Qualified Substitute Loan after the date of such substitution. Monthly Payments received with
respect to Qualified Substitute Loans on or before the date of substitution will be retained by the
Loan Originator. The Trust will be entitled to all payments received on the Deleted Loan on or
before the date of
substitution and the Loan Originator shall thereafter be entitled to retain all amounts
subsequently received in respect of such Deleted Loan. The Loan Originator shall give written
notice to the Issuer, the Servicer (if the Loan Originator is not then acting as such), the
Indenture Trustee and the Noteholder Agent that such substitution has taken place and the Servicer
shall amend the Loan Schedule to reflect (i) the removal of such Deleted Loan from the terms of
this Agreement and (ii) the substitution of the Qualified Substitute Loan. The Servicer shall
promptly deliver to the Issuer, the Loan Originator, the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholder Agent
a copy of the amended Loan Schedule. Upon such substitution, such Qualified Substitute Loan or
Loans shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement in all respects, and the Loan Originator
shall be deemed to have made with respect to such Qualified Substitute Loan or Loans, as of the
date of substitution, the covenants, representations and warranties set forth in  Exhibit F 
hereto. On the date of such substitution, the Loan Originator will (x) if no Overcollateralization
Shortfall exists as of the date of substitution (after giving effect to such substitution), remit
to the Noteholders as provided in  Section 5.01(c)(4)(i)  or (y) otherwise deposit into the
Collection Account, in each case an amount equal to the related Substitution Adjustment, if any. In
addition, on the date of such substitution, the Servicer shall cause the Indenture Trustee to
release the Deleted Loan from the Lien of the Indenture and the Servicer will cause each such
Qualified Substitute Loan to be pledged to the Indenture Trustee under the Indenture as part of the
Trust Estate.

39

(c) With respect to all Unqualified Loans and other Loans repurchased by the
Loan Originator pursuant to this Agreement, upon the deposit of the Repurchase Price therefor into
the Collection Account or the conveyance of one or more Qualified Substitute Loans and payment of
any Substitution Adjustment, (i) the Issuer shall assign to the Loan Originator, without
representation or warranty, all of the Issuer s right, title and interest in and to each such
Unqualified Loan or Loan, which right, title and interest were conveyed to the Issuer pursuant to
 Section 2.01  hereof and (ii) the Indenture Trustee shall assign to the Loan Originator,
without recourse, representation or warranty, all the Indenture Trustee s right, title and interest
in and to each such Unqualified Loan or Loan, which right, title and interest were conveyed to the
Indenture Trustee pursuant to  Section 2.01  hereof and the Indenture. The Issuer and the
Indenture Trustee shall, at the expense of the Loan Originator, take any actions as shall be
reasonably requested by the Loan Originator to effect the repurchase of any such Loans and to have
the Custodian return the Custodial Loan File of the Deleted Loan to the Servicer.

(d) It is understood and agreed that the obligations of the Loan Originator set
forth in this  Section 3.06  to cure, purchase or substitute for an Unqualified Loan
constitute the sole remedies hereunder of the Depositor, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the
Owner Trustee and the Securityholders respecting a breach of the representations and warranties
contained in  Section 3.02  hereof and in  Exhibit F  hereto. Any cause of action
against the Loan Originator relating to or arising out of a defect in a Custodial Loan File or
against the Depositor, the Loan Originator or the Servicer relating to or arising out of a breach
of any representations and warranties made in  Sections 3.01 ,  3.02  or  3.03 
hereof, respectively, and in  Exhibit F  hereto shall accrue as to any Loan upon (i)
discovery of such defect or breach by any party and notice thereof to the Depositor, the Loan
Originator or the Servicer, as applicable, or notice thereof by the Depositor, the Loan Originator
or the Servicer, as applicable, to the Indenture Trustee, (ii) failure by the Depositor, the Loan
Originator or the Servicer, as applicable, to cure such defect or breach or failure by the Loan
Originator to purchase or substitute such Loan as specified above, and (iii) demand upon the Loan
Originator, as applicable, by the Issuer or the Majority Noteholders for all amounts payable in
respect of such Loan.

(e) Neither the Issuer nor the Indenture Trustee shall have any duty to conduct any
affirmative investigation other than as specifically set forth in this
Agreement as to the occurrence of any condition requiring the repurchase or substitution of
any Loan pursuant to this Section or the eligibility of any Loan for purposes of this Agreement.

Section 3.07    Dispositions   . 

(a) The Majority Noteholders may at any time in their sole discretion, and from time
to time, require that the Issuer redeem all or any portion of the Note Principal Balance of the
Notes by paying the Note Redemption Amount with respect to the Note Principal Balance to be
redeemed in accordance with  Section 10.04 . In connection with any such redemption, the
Issuer shall effect Dispositions at the direction of the Majority Noteholders in accordance with
this Agreement, including in accordance with this  Section 3.07 .

(b) (i) In consideration of the consideration received from the Depositor
under the Loan Purchase and Contribution Agreement, the Loan Originator hereby agrees and covenants
that in connection with each Disposition it shall effect the following:

(A) make such representations and warranties concerning the Loans as of the
 cut-off date  of the related Disposition to the Disposition Participants as may be
necessary to effect the Disposition and such additional representations and warranties as
may be necessary, in the reasonable opinion of any of the Disposition Participants, to
effect such Disposition; provided, that, to the extent that the Loan Originator has at
the time of the Disposition actual knowledge of

40

any facts or circumstances that would render any of such representations and
warranties materially false, the Loan Originator shall notify the Disposition
Participants of such facts or circumstances and, in such event, shall have no obligation
to make such materially false representation and warranty;

(B) supply such information, opinions of counsel, letters from law and/or
accounting firms and other documentation and certificates regarding the origination of
the Loans as any Disposition Participant shall reasonably request to effect a Disposition
and enter into such indemnification agreements customary for such transaction relating to
or in connection with the Disposition as the Disposition Participants may reasonably
require;

(C) make itself available for and engage in good faith consultation with
the Disposition Participants concerning information to be contained in any document,
agreement, private placement memorandum, or filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission relating to the Loan Originator or the Loans in connection with a Disposition
and shall use reasonable efforts to compile any information and prepare any reports and
certificates, into a form, whether written or electronic, suitable for inclusion in such
documentation;

(D) to implement the foregoing and to otherwise effect a Disposition, enter
into, or arrange for its Affiliates to enter into insurance and indemnity agreements,
underwriting or placement agreements, servicing agreements, purchase agreements and any
other documentation which may reasonably be required of or reasonably deemed appropriate
by the Disposition Participants in order to effect a Disposition;

(E) to deliver to the applicable Disposition Participants for inclusion in
any prospectus or other offering material any documentation or
information required in connection with Regulation AB, and to provide
indemnification in connection with such information; and

(F) take such further actions as may be reasonably necessary to effect the
foregoing;

provided, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (a) the Loan Originator shall have no
liability for the Loans arising from or relating to the ongoing ability of the related Borrowers to
pay under the Loans; (b) none of the indemnities hereunder shall constitute an unconditional
guarantee by the Loan Originator of collectability of the Loans; (c) the Loan Originator shall have
no obligation with respect to the financial inability of any Borrower to pay principal, interest or
other amount owing by such Borrower under a Loan; and (d) the Loan Originator shall only be
required to enter into documentation in connection with Dispositions that is consistent with the
prior public securitizations of affiliates of the Loan Originator, provided that to the extent an
Affiliate of any Noteholder acts as  depositor  or performs a similar function in a Securitization,
additional indemnities and informational representations and warranties are provided which are
consistent with those in the Basic Documents and may upon request of the Loan Originator be set
forth in a separate agreement between such Affiliate of the Noteholder and the Loan Originator.

(ii) In the event of any Disposition to the Loan Originator or any of its
Affiliates (except in connection with a Securitization or a Disposition to a QSPE
Affiliate), the purchase price paid by the Loan Originator or any such Affiliate shall be
the  fair market value  of the Loans subject to such Disposition (as determined by the
Market Value Agent based upon recent sales of comparable loans or such other objective
criteria as may be approved for determining  fair market value  by a  Big Four  national
accounting firm).

41

(iii) As long as no Event of Default or Default shall have occurred and
be continuing under this Agreement or the Indenture, the Servicer may continue to service
the Loans included in any Disposition subject to any applicable  term-to-term  servicing
provisions in  Section 9.01(b)  and subject to any required amendments to the
related servicing provisions as may be necessary to effect the related Disposition
including but not limited to the obligation to make recoverable principal and interest
advances on the Loans.

After the termination of the Revolving Period, the Issuer shall effect one or more
Dispositions at the direction of the Disposition Agent, and the Loan Originator, the Issuer and the
Depositor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect a Disposition at the direction of the
Disposition Agent.

(c) The Issuer shall effect Dispositions at the direction of the Majority
Noteholders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Basic Documents. In connection
therewith, the Trust agrees to assist the Loan Originator in such Dispositions and accordingly it
shall, at the request and direction of the Majority Noteholders:

(i) transfer, deliver and sell all or a portion of the Loans as of the
 cut-off dates  of the related Dispositions, to such Disposition Participants as may be
necessary to effect the Dispositions; provided, that any such sale shall be for  fair
market value,  as determined by the Market Value Agent in its reasonable discretion;

(ii) deposit the cash Disposition Proceeds into the Distribution Account
pursuant to  Section 5.01(c)(2)(D) ;

(iii) to the extent that a Securitization creates any Retained Securities,

with the terms of this Agreement; and

(iv) take such further actions, including executing and delivering
documents, certificates and agreements, as may be reasonably necessary to effect such
Dispositions.

(d) The Servicer hereby covenants that (i) it will take such actions as may be
reasonably necessary to effect Dispositions as the Disposition Participants may request and direct,
including without limitation providing the Loan Originator such information as may be required to
make representations and warranties required hereunder, (ii) it will make such representations and
warranties regarding its servicing of the Loans hereunder as of the Cut-off Date of the related
Disposition as reasonably required by the Disposition Participants, and (iii) it will deliver to
the applicable Disposition Participants for inclusion in any prospectus or other offering material
any documentation or information required in connection with Regulation AB, and will provide
indemnification in connection with such information.

(e) The Majority Noteholders may effect Whole Loan Sales upon written notice to the
Servicer of its intent to cause the Issuer to effect a Whole Loan Sale at least five (5) Business
Days in advance thereof. The Disposition Agent shall serve as agent for Whole Loan Sales and will
receive a reasonable fee for such services provided that no such fee shall be payable if (i) the
Loan Originator or its Affiliates purchase such Loans, and (ii) no Event of Default or Default
shall have occurred. The Loan Originator or its Affiliates may concurrently bid to purchase Loans
in a Whole Loan Sale; provided, however, that neither the Loan Originator nor any such Affiliates
shall pay a price in excess of the fair market value thereof (as determined by the Market Value
Agent based upon recent sales of comparable loans or such other objective criteria as may be
approved for determining  fair market value  by a  Big

42

Four  national accounting firm). In the event that the Loan Originator does not bid in any
such Whole Loan Sale, it shall have a right of first refusal to purchase the Loans offered for sale
at the price offered by the highest bidder. The Disposition Agent shall conduct any Whole Loan Sale
subject to the Loan Originator s right of first refusal and shall promptly notify the Loan
Originator of the amount of the highest bid. The Loan Originator shall have five (5) Business Days
following its receipt of such notice to exercise its right of first refusal by notifying the
Disposition Agent in writing.

(f) Except as otherwise expressly set forth under this  Section 3.07 , the
parties  rights and obligations under this  Section 3.07  shall continue notwithstanding the
occurrence of an Event of Default.

(g) The Disposition Participants (and the Majority Noteholders to the extent
directing the Disposition Participants) shall be independent contractors to the Issuer and shall
have no fiduciary obligations to the Issuer or any of its Affiliates. In that connection, the
Disposition Participants shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith and shall
not be liable with respect to any action they take or omit to take in good faith in the performance
of their duties.

Section 3.08    Loan Originator Put; Servicer Call   . 

(a)   Loan Originator Put.   The Loan Originator shall promptly purchase, upon the
written demand of the Majority Noteholders, any Put/Call Loan; provided that the Loan Originator
may (if it is at that time the Servicer), upon receipt of such demand, elect to repurchase such
Put/Call Loan pursuant to (b) below, in which case such repurchase shall be deemed a Servicer Call.

(b)   Servicer Call.   The Servicer may repurchase any Put/Call Loan at any time. Such
Servicer Calls shall be solely at the option of the Servicer. Prior to exercising a Servicer Call,
the Servicer shall deliver written notice to the Majority Noteholders and the Indenture Trustee
which notice shall identify each Loan to be purchased and the Repurchase Price therefor; provided,
however, that the Servicer may irrevocably waive its right to repurchase any Put/Call Loan as soon
as reasonably practicable following its receipt of notice of the occurrence of any event or events
giving rise to such Loan being a Put/Call Loan.

(c) In connection with each Loan Originator Put, the Loan Originator shall deposit
into the Collection Account the Repurchase Price for the Loans to be repurchased. In connection
with each Servicer Call, the Servicer shall deposit into the Collection Account the Repurchase
Price for the Loans to be purchased. The aggregate Repurchase Price of all Loans transferred
pursuant to  Section 3.08(a)  as of any date shall in no event exceed the Unfunded Transfer
Obligation at the time of any Loan Originator Put.

Section 3.09    Modification of Underwriting Guidelines   . 

The Loan Originator shall give the Noteholders prompt written notification of any modification
or change to the Underwriting Guidelines. If the Noteholder Agent objects in writing to any
modification or change to the Underwriting Guidelines within 15 days after receipt of such notice,
no Loans may be conveyed to the Issuer pursuant to this Agreement unless such Loans have been
originated pursuant to the Underwriting Guidelines without giving effect to such modification or
change. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, any Loan conveyed to
the Issuer pursuant to this Agreement pursuant to a modification or change to the Underwriting
Guidelines that has been rejected by the Noteholders or which the Noteholders did not receive
notice of, such Loan shall be deemed an Unqualified Loan and be repurchased or substituted for in
accordance with  Section 3.06 .

employees, agents and  control persons,  as such term is used under the Act and under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (each a   Servicer Indemnified Party  ) and hold
harmless each of them against any and all claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
reasonable legal fees and related costs, judgments, and other costs and expenses resulting from any
claim, demand, defense or assertion based on or grounded upon, or resulting from, a breach of any
of the Servicer s representations and warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement or in
any way relating to the failure of the Servicer to perform its duties and service the Loans in
compliance with the terms of this Agreement except to the extent such loss arises out of such
Servicer Indemnified Party s gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided, however, that if the
Servicer is not liable pursuant to the provisions of  Section 8.01(b)  hereof for its failure
to perform its duties and service the Loans in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, then

58

the provisions of this  Section 8.01  shall have no force and effect with respect to
such failure. The provisions of this indemnity shall run directly to and be enforceable by a
Servicer Indemnified Party subject to the limitations hereof.

(b) None of the Loan Originator, the Depositor or the Servicer or any of their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees or agents shall be under any liability to the
Owner Trustee, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Securityholders for any action taken, or
for refraining from the taking of any action, in good faith pursuant to this Agreement, or for
errors in judgment; provided, however, that this provision shall not protect the Loan Originator,
the Depositor, the Servicer or any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
agents against the remedies provided herein for the breach of any warranties, representations or
covenants made herein, or against any expense or liability specifically required to be borne by
such party without right of reimbursement pursuant to the terms hereof, or against any expense or
liability which would otherwise be imposed by reason of misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the
performance of the respective duties of the Servicer, the Depositor or the Loan Originator, as the
case may be. The Loan Originator, the Depositor, the Servicer and any of their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents may rely in good faith on any document of any
kind which, prima facie, is properly executed and submitted by any Person respecting any matters
arising hereunder.

(c) The Loan Originator agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Depositor and the
Noteholders, as the ultimate assignees from the Depositor (each an   Originator Indemnified
Party ,  together with the Servicer Indemnified Parties, the   Indemnified Parties  ),
from and against any loss, liability, expense, damage, claim or injury arising out of or based on
(i) any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of the Loan Originator, the Servicer or
their Affiliates, in any Basic Document, including, without limitation, the origination or prior
servicing of the Loans by reason of any acts, omissions, or alleged acts or omissions arising out
of activities of the Loan
Originator, the Servicer or their Affiliates, and (ii) any untrue statement by the Loan
Originator, the Servicer or its Affiliates of any material fact or any such Person s failure to
state a material fact necessary to make such statements not misleading with respect to any such
Person s statements contained in any Basic Document, including, without limitation, any Officer s
Certificate, statement, report or other document or information prepared by any such Person and
furnished or to be furnished by it pursuant to or in connection with the transactions contemplated
thereby and not corrected prior to completion of the relevant transaction including, without
limitation, such written information as may have been and may be furnished in connection with any
due diligence investigation with respect to the Loans or any such Person s business, operations or
financial condition, including reasonable attorneys  fees and other costs or expenses incurred in
connection with the defense of any actual or threatened action, proceeding or claim; provided that
the Loan Originator shall not indemnify an Originator Indemnified Party to the extent such loss,
liability, expense, damage or injury is due to either an Originator Indemnified Party s willful
misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence or by reason of an Originator Indemnified Party s
reckless disregard of its obligations hereunder; provided, further, that the Loan Originator shall
not be so required to indemnify an Originator Indemnified Party or to otherwise be liable hereunder
or under any provision of the Basic Documents to an Originator Indemnified Party for any losses in
respect of the performance of the Loans, the insolvency, bankruptcy, delinquency, creditworthiness
and similar characteristics of the Borrowers under the Loans, the uncollectability of any
principal, interest, and any other charges (including late fees) under such loans, changes in the
market value of the Loans or other similar investment risks associated with the Loans arising from
a breach of any representation or warranty set forth in  Exhibit F  hereto, the sole remedy
for the breach of which is provided in  Section 3.06  hereof. The provisions of this
indemnity shall run directly to and be enforceable by an Originator Indemnified Party subject to
the limitations hereof.

59

(d) With respect to a claim subject to indemnity hereunder made by any Person
against an Indemnified Party (a   Third Party Claim  ), such Indemnified Party shall notify
the related indemnifying parties (each an   Indemnifying Party  ) in writing of the Third
Party Claim within a reasonable time after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of
the Third Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Parties shall have previously obtained actual
knowledge thereof. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Parties,
within a reasonable time after the Indemnified Party s receipt thereof, copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party
Claim. No failure to give such notice or deliver such documents shall effect the rights to
indemnity hereunder. Each Indemnifying Party shall promptly notify the Indenture Trustee and the
Indemnified Party (if other than the Indenture Trustee) of any claim of which it has been notified
and shall promptly notify the Indenture Trustee and the Indemnified Party (if applicable) of its
intended course of action with respect to any claim.

(e) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, while maintaining
control over its own defense, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate and consult fully with the
Indemnifying Party in preparing such defense, and the Indemnified Party may defend the same in such
manner as it may deem appropriate, including settling such claim or litigation after giving notice
to the Indemnifying Party of such terms and the Indemnifying Party will promptly reimburse the
Indemnified Party upon written request; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may not
settle any claim or litigation without the consent of the Indemnifying Party; provided, further,
that the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to reject the selection of counsel by the
Indemnified Party if the Indemnifying Party reasonably determines that such counsel is
inappropriate in light of the nature of the claim or litigation and shall have the right to
assume the defense of such claim or litigation if the Indemnifying Party determines that the
manner of defense of such claim or litigation is unreasonable.

Section 8.02    Merger or Consolidation of the Servicer   . 

The Servicer shall keep in full effect its existence, rights and franchises as a corporation,
and will obtain and preserve its qualification to do business as a foreign corporation and maintain
such other licenses and permits in each jurisdiction necessary to protect the validity and

its duties under each Basic Document to which it is a party; provided, however, that the Servicer
may merge or consolidate with any other corporation upon the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in the following paragraph.

Subject to the prior written consent of the Majority Noteholders, any Person into which the
Servicer may be merged or consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Servicer shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to the business of
the Servicer, shall be an Eligible Servicer and shall be the successor of the Servicer, as
applicable hereunder, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part
of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding. The Servicer shall
send notice of any such merger, conversion, consolidation or succession to the Indenture Trustee
and the Issuer.

Section 8.03    Limitation on Liability of the Servicer and Others   . 

The Servicer and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Servicer may rely on any
document of any kind which it in good faith reasonably believes to be genuine and to have been

the terms of Section 8.01 hereof, the Servicer shall have no obligation to appear with respect to,
prosecute or defend any legal action which is not incidental to the Servicer s duty to service the
Loans in accordance with this Agreement.

60

Section 8.04    Servicer Not to Resign; Assignment   . 

The Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties hereby imposed on it except (a)
with the consent of the Majority Noteholders or (b) upon determination that its duties hereunder

the preceding sentence permitting the resignation of the Servicer shall be evidenced by an
Independent opinion of counsel to such effect delivered (at the expense of the Servicer) to the
Indenture Trustee and the Majority Noteholders. No resignation of the Servicer shall become
effective until a successor servicer, appointed pursuant to the provisions of  Section 9.02 
hereof shall have assumed the Servicer s responsibilities, duties, liabilities (other than those
liabilities arising prior to the appointment of such successor) and obligations under this
Agreement.

Except as expressly provided herein, the Servicer shall not assign or transfer any of its
rights, benefits or privileges hereunder to any other Person, or delegate to or subcontract with,
or authorize or appoint any other Person to perform any of the duties, covenants or obligations to
be performed by the Servicer hereunder and any agreement, instrument or act purporting to effect
any such assignment, transfer, delegation or appointment shall be void.

The Servicer agrees to cooperate with any successor Servicer in effecting the transfer of the
Servicer s servicing responsibilities and rights hereunder pursuant to the first paragraph of this
 Section 8.04 , including, without limitation, the transfer to such successor of all relevant
records and documents (including any Loan Files in the possession of the Servicer) and all amounts
received with respect to the Loans and not otherwise permitted to be retained by the Servicer
pursuant to this Agreement. In addition, the Servicer, at its sole cost and expense, shall prepare,

Loan Files in its possession and do or accomplish all other acts necessary or appropriate to effect
such termination and transfer of servicing responsibilities.

Section 8.05    Relationship of Servicer to Issuer and the Indenture Trustee   . 

The relationship of the Servicer (and of any successor to the Servicer as servicer under this
Agreement) to the Issuer, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee under this Agreement is
intended by the parties hereto to be that of an independent contractor and not of a joint venturer,
agent or partner of the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee.

Section 8.06    Servicer May Own Securities   . 

Each of the Servicer and any Affiliate of the Servicer may in its individual or any other
capacity become the owner or pledgee of Securities with the same rights as it would have if it were
not the Servicer or an Affiliate thereof except as otherwise specifically provided herein;
provided, however, that at any time that Option One or any of its Affiliates is the Servicer,
neither the Servicer nor any of its Affiliates (other than an Affiliate which is a corporation
whose purpose is limited to holding securities and related activities and which cannot incur
recourse debt) may be a Noteholder. Securities so owned by or pledged to the Servicer or such
Affiliate shall have an equal and proportionate benefit under the provisions of this Agreement,
without preference, priority, or distinction as among all of the Securities; provided, however,
that any Securities owned by the Servicer or any Affiliate thereof, during the time such Securities
are owned by them, shall be without voting rights for any purpose set forth in this Agreement
unless the Servicer or such Affiliate owns all outstanding Securities of the related class. The
Servicer shall notify the Indenture Trustee promptly after it or any of its Affiliates becomes the
owner or pledgee of a Security.

61

Section 8.07    Indemnification of the Indenture Trustee, Noteholders and Noteholder

Noteholders and the Noteholder Agent in accordance with  Section 9.01  of the Note Purchase
Agreement as if it were signatory thereto.

ARTICLE IX

shall occur and be continuing, that is to say:

(1) any failure by the Servicer to deposit into the Collection Account or
the Distribution Account any amounts required to be deposited therein or any failure by
the Servicer to make any of the required payments therefrom in accordance with
 Section 5.01  hereof; or

(2) any failure on the part of the Servicer duly to observe or perform in
any material respect any other of the material covenants or agreements on the part of the
Servicer, contained in any Basic Document to which it is a party, which continues
unremedied for a period of thirty (30) days (or, in the case of payment of insurance
premiums, for a period of fifteen (15) days) after the date on which written notice of
such failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given to the Servicer by
any other party hereto or to the Servicer (with copy to each other party hereto), by
Holders of 25% of the Percentage Interests of the Notes or the Trust Certificates; or

(3) any breach on the part of the Servicer of any representation or
warranty contained in any Basic Document to which it is a party that materially and
adversely affects the interests of any of the parties hereto or any Securityholder and
which continues unremedied for a period of thirty (30) days after the date on which
notice of such breach, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given to the
Servicer by any other party hereto or to the Servicer (with copy to each other party
hereto), by the Noteholder Agent or Holders of 25% of the Percentage Interests (as
defined in the Indenture) of the Notes; or

(4) there shall have been commenced before a court or agency or
supervisory authority having jurisdiction in the premises an involuntary proceeding
against the Servicer under any present or future federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency
or similar law for the appointment of a conservator, receiver, liquidator, trustee or
similar official in any bankruptcy, insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshaling of
assets and liabilities or similar proceedings, or for the winding-up or liquidation of
its affairs, which action shall not have been dismissed for a period of sixty (60) days;
or

(5) the Servicer shall consent to the appointment of a conservator,
receiver, liquidator, trustee or similar official in any bankruptcy, insolvency,
readjustment of debt, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings of or
relating to it or of or relating to all or substantially all of its property; or

62

(6) the Servicer (or the Loan Originator if the Servicer is not
Option One) fails to comply with the Financial Covenants; or

(7) a Change in Control of the Servicer without prior written consent of
the Noteholders or the Servicer otherwise ceases to be a 100% direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of H R Block Inc.; or

(8) the Servicer shall admit in writing its inability to pay its debts
generally as they become due, file a petition to take advantage of any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization statute, make an assignment for the benefit of
its creditors, voluntarily suspend payment of its obligations, or take any corporate
action in furtherance of the foregoing.

Then, and in each and every such case, so long as a Servicer Event of Default shall not have been
remedied, the Indenture Trustee or the Majority Noteholders, by notice in
writing to the Servicer may, in addition to whatever rights such Person may have at law or in
equity to damages, including injunctive relief and specific performance, may terminate all the
rights and obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement and in and to the Loans and the
proceeds thereof, as servicer under this Agreement. Upon receipt by the Servicer of such written
notice, all authority and power of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect to the
Loans or otherwise, shall, subject to  Section 9.02  hereof, pass to and be vested in a
successor servicer, and the successor servicer is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and
deliver, on behalf of the Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents and
other instruments and do or cause to be done all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to
effect the purposes of such notice of termination, including, but not limited to, the transfer and
endorsement or assignment of the Loans and related documents. The Servicer agrees to cooperate with
the successor servicer in effecting the termination of the Servicer s responsibilities and rights
hereunder, including, without limitation, the transfer to the successor servicer for administration
by it of all amounts which shall at the time be credited by the Servicer to each Collection Account
or thereafter received with respect to the Loans.

(b) Upon the occurrence of (i) an Event of Default or Default under any of the Basic
Documents, (ii) a Servicer Event of Default under this Agreement, (iii) a Rapid Amortization
Trigger, or (iv) an event that shall have a reasonable possibility of materially impairing the
ability of the Servicer to service and administer the Loans in accordance with the terms and
provisions set forth in the Basic Documents (each, a   Term Event  ), the Servicer s right to
service the Loans pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be in effect for an initial period
commencing on the date on which such Term Event occurred and shall automatically terminate at 5:00
p.m., New York City time, on the last Business Day of the calendar month in which such Term Event
occurred (the   Initial Term  ). Thereafter, the Initial Term shall be extendible in the sole
discretion of the Majority Noteholders by written notice (each, a   Servicer Extension
Notice  ) of the Majority Noteholders for successive one-month terms (each such term ending at
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last business day of the related month). Following a Term
Event, the Servicer hereby agrees that the Servicer shall be bound for the duration of the Initial
Term and the term covered by any such Servicer Extension Notice to act as the Servicer pursuant to
this Agreement. Following a Term Event, the Servicer agrees that if, as of 3:00 p.m. (New York City
time) on the last Business Day of any month, the Servicer shall not have received a Servicer
Extension Notice from the Majority Noteholders, the Servicer shall give written notice of such
non-receipt to the Noteholders by 4:00 p.m. (New York City time). Following a Term Event, the
failure of the Majority Noteholders to deliver a Servicer Extension Notice by 5:00 p.m. (New York
City time) shall result in the automatic and immediate termination of the Servicer (the
  Termination Date  ). Notwithstanding these time frames, the Servicer and the Noteholders
shall comply with all applicable laws in connection with such transfer and the Servicer shall
continue to service the Loans until completion of such transfer.

63

Section 9.02    Appointment of Successor   . 

On and after the date the Servicer receives a notice of termination pursuant to Section 9.01
hereof or is automatically terminated pursuant to Section 9.01(b) hereof, or the Owner Trustee
receives the resignation of the Servicer evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel or accompanied by the
consents required by  Section 8.04  hereof, or the Servicer is removed as servicer pursuant
to this Article IX or Section 4.01 of the Servicing Addendum, then, the Majority Noteholders shall
appoint a successor servicer to be the successor in all respects to the Servicer in its capacity as
Servicer under this Agreement and the transactions set forth or provided for herein and shall be
subject to all the responsibilities, duties and liabilities relating thereto placed on the Servicer
by the terms and provisions hereof, provided, however, that the successor servicer shall not be
liable for any actions of any servicer prior to it.

The successor servicer shall be obligated to make Servicing Advances hereunder. As
compensation therefor, the successor servicer appointed pursuant to the following paragraph, shall
be entitled to all funds relating to the Loans which the Servicer would have been entitled to
receive from the Collection Account pursuant to  Section 5.01  hereof as if the Servicer had
continued to act as servicer hereunder, together with other Servicing Compensation in the form of
assumption fees, late payment charges or otherwise as provided in Section 4.15 of the Servicing
Addendum. The Servicer shall not be entitled to any termination fee if it is terminated pursuant to
 Section 9.01  hereof but shall be entitled to any accrued and unpaid Servicing Compensation
to the date of termination.

Any collections received by the Servicer after removal or resignation shall be endorsed by it
to the Indenture Trustee and remitted directly to the successor servicer. The compensation of any
successor servicer appointed shall be the Servicing Fee, together with other Servicing Compensation
provided for herein. The Indenture Trustee, the Issuer, any Custodian, the Servicer and any such
successor servicer shall take such action, consistent with this Agreement, as shall be reasonably
necessary to effect any such succession. Any costs or expenses incurred by the Indenture Trustee in
connection with the termination of the Servicer and the succession of a successor servicer shall be
an expense of the outgoing Servicer and, to the extent not paid thereby, an expense of such
successor servicer. The Servicer agrees to cooperate with the Indenture Trustee and any successor
servicer in effecting the termination of the Servicer s servicing responsibilities and rights
hereunder and shall promptly provide the successor servicer all documents and records reasonably
requested by it to enable it to assume the Servicer s functions hereunder and shall promptly also
transfer to the successor servicer all amounts which then have been or should have been deposited
in any Trust Account maintained by the Servicer or which are thereafter received with respect to
the Loans. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Majority Noteholders shall have the
right to order the Servicer s Loan Files and all other files of the Servicer relating to the Loans
and all other records of the Servicer and all documents relating to the Loans which are then or may
thereafter come into the possession of the Servicer or any third party acting for the Servicer to
be delivered to such custodian or servicer as it selects and the Servicer shall deliver to such
custodian or servicer such assignments as the Majority Noteholders shall request. No successor
servicer shall be held liable by reason of any failure to make, or any delay in making, any
distribution hereunder or any portion thereof caused by (i) the failure of the Servicer to deliver,
or any delay in delivering, cash, documents or records to it or (ii) restrictions imposed by any
regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Servicer hereunder. No appointment of a successor
to the Servicer hereunder shall be effective until written notice of such proposed appointment
shall have been provided to the Noteholders, the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer and the Depositor,
and the Majority Noteholders and the Issuer shall have consented in writing thereto.

In connection with such appointment and assumption, the Majority Noteholders may make such
arrangements for the compensation of such successor servicer out of payments on the Loans as they
and such successor servicer shall agree.

Section 9.03    Waiver of Defaults   .

pursuant to this Article IX. Upon any waiver of a past default, such default shall cease to exist

purpose of this Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair
any right consequent thereto except to the extent expressly so waived.

Section 9.04    Accounting Upon Termination of Servicer   .

expense:

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE LOANS

The Loan Originator hereby represents and warrants to the other parties to the Sale and
Servicing Agreement and the Securityholders, with respect to each such Loan as of the related
Transfer Date (except as otherwise expressly agreed in writing by the Majority Noteholders):

(i) The information set forth in the related Loan Schedule and the
information contained on the electronic data file delivered to the Noteholder Agent is complete,
true and correct;

(ii) All payments required to be made up to the close of business on the
Transfer Date for such Loan under the terms of the Promissory Note have been made; the Loan
Originator has not advanced funds, or induced, solicited or knowingly received any advance of funds
from a party other than the owner of the related Mortgaged Property, directly or indirectly, for
the payment of any amount required by the Promissory Note or Mortgage; and there has been no
delinquency, exclusive of any period of grace, in any payment by the Borrower thereunder during the
last twelve months;

(iii) There are no delinquent taxes, ground rents, water charges, sewer rents,
assessments, insurance premiums, leasehold payments, including assessments payable in future
installments or other outstanding charges affecting the related Mortgaged Property;

(iv) The terms of the Promissory Note and the Mortgage have not been impaired,
waived, altered or modified in any respect and the Promissory Note and the Mortgage have not been
satisfied, canceled, rescinded or subordinated in whole or in part. No instrument of waiver,
alteration, modification, release, cancellation, rescission or satisfaction has been executed, and
no Borrower has been released, in whole or in part;

(v) The Promissory Note and the Mortgage are not subject to any right of
rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense, including the defense of usury, nor will the
operation of any of the terms of the Promissory Note or the Mortgage, or the exercise of any right
thereunder, render either the Promissory Note or the Mortgage unenforceable, in whole or in part,
or subject to any right of rescission,
set-off, counterclaim or defense, including the defense of usury and no such right of
rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense has been asserted with respect thereto;

(vi) All buildings upon the Mortgaged Property are insured by an insurer
acceptable to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac against loss by fire, hazards of extended coverage and such
other hazards as are customary in the area where the Mortgaged Property is located, pursuant to
insurance policies conforming to the requirements of the Servicing Addendum, in an amount
sufficient to avoid the application of any  co-insurance provisions . All such insurance policies
contain a standard mortgagee clause naming the Loan Originator, its successors and assigns as
mortgagee and all premiums thereon have been paid. If the Mortgaged Property is in an area
identified on a Flood Hazard Map or Flood Insurance Rate Map issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency as having special flood hazards (and such flood insurance has been made
available) a flood insurance policy meeting the requirements of the current guidelines of the
Federal Insurance Administration is in effect which policy conforms to the requirements of Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac. The Mortgage obligates the Borrower thereunder to maintain all such insurance
at the Borrower s cost and expense, and on the Borrower s failure to do so, authorizes the holder
of the Mortgage to maintain such insurance at Borrower s cost and expense and to seek reimbursement
therefor from the Borrower;

F-1

(vii) Any and all requirements of any federal, state or local law including,
without limitation, usury, truth in lending, real estate settlement procedures, consumer credit
protection, equal credit opportunity, fair housing or disclosure laws applicable to the origination
and servicing of the Loans have been complied with;

(viii) The Mortgage has not been satisfied, canceled, subordinated or rescinded,
in whole or in part, and the Mortgaged Property has not been released from the lien of the
Mortgage, in whole or in part, nor has any instrument been executed that would effect any such
satisfaction, cancellation, subordination, rescission or release;

(ix) The Mortgage is a valid, existing and enforceable first lien (or, with
respect to Loans identified as Second Lien Loans on the Loan Schedule, second lien) on the
Mortgaged Property, including all improvements on the Mortgaged Property subject only to (a) the
lien of current real property taxes and assessments not yet due and payable, (b) covenants,
conditions and restrictions, rights of way, easements and other matters of the public record as of
the date of recording being acceptable to mortgage lending institutions generally and specifically
referred to in the lender s title insurance policy delivered to the originator of the Loan and
which do not adversely affect the Appraised Value of the Mortgaged Property, (c) other matters to
which like properties are commonly subject which do not materially interfere with the benefits of
the security intended to be provided by the Mortgage or the use, enjoyment, value or marketability
of the related Mortgaged Property and (d) the first lien on the Mortgaged Property, in the case of
the Second Lien Loans. Any security agreement, chattel mortgage or equivalent document related to
and delivered in connection with the Loan establishes and creates a valid, existing and enforceable
first or second lien and first or second priority security interest on the property described
therein and the Loan Originator has full right to sell and assign the same to the Depositor and the
Issuer. The Mortgaged Property was not, as of the date of origination of the Loan, subject to a
mortgage, deed of trust, deed to secure debt or other security instrument creating a lien
subordinate to the lien of the Mortgage;

(x) The Promissory Note and the related Mortgage are genuine and each is the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the maker thereof, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization;

(xi) All parties to the Promissory Note and the Mortgage had legal capacity to
enter into the Loan and to execute and deliver the Promissory Note and the Mortgage, and the
Promissory Note and the Mortgage have been duly and properly executed by such parties. The Borrower
is a natural person;

(xii) The proceeds of the Loan have been fully disbursed to or for the account
of the Borrower and there is no obligation for the mortgagee to advance additional funds thereunder
and any and all requirements as to completion of any on-site or off-site improvement and as to
disbursements of any escrow funds therefor have been complied with. All costs, fees and expenses
incurred in making or closing the Loan and the recording of the Mortgage have been paid, and the
Borrower is not entitled to any refund of any amounts paid or due to the Loan Originator pursuant
to the Promissory Note or Mortgage;

(xiii) The Loan Originator has good title to and is the sole legal, beneficial
and equitable owner of the Promissory Note and the Mortgage and has full right to transfer and sell
the Loan to the Depositor and the Issuer free and clear of any encumbrance, equity, lien, pledge,
charge, claim or security interest;

F-2

(xiv) All parties which have had any interest in the Loan, whether as mortgagee,
assignee, pledgee or otherwise, are (or, during the period in which they held and disposed of such
interest, were) in compliance with any and all applicable  doing business  and licensing
requirements of the laws of the state wherein the Mortgaged Property is located;

(xv) The Loan is covered by either (i) a lender s title insurance policy
(which, in the case of an ARM has an adjustable rate mortgage endorsement) commercially acceptable
to prudent mortgage lending institutions, issued by a title insurer licensed and qualified to do
business in the jurisdiction where the Mortgaged Property is located, insuring (subject to the
exceptions contained in (ix)(a) and (b) above) the Loan Originator, its successors and assigns as
to the first or second priority lien of the Mortgage in the original principal amount of the Loan
and, with respect to any ARM, against any loss by reason of the invalidity or unenforceability of
the lien resulting from the provisions of the Mortgage providing for adjustment in the Loan
Interest Rate and Monthly Payment or (ii) if generally acceptable in the jurisdiction where the
Mortgaged Property is located, an attorney s opinion of title given by an attorney licensed to
practice law in the jurisdiction where the Mortgaged Property is located. Additionally, such
lender s title insurance policy affirmatively insures ingress and egress to and from the Mortgaged
Property, and against encroachments by or upon the Mortgaged Property or any interest therein. The
Loan Originator is the sole insured of such lender s title insurance policy, and such lender s
title insurance policy is in full force and effect and will be in full force and effect, and the
issuer will be insured thereunder, upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. No claims have been made under such lender s title insurance policy, and no prior holder
of the related Mortgage, including the Loan Originator, has done, by act or omission, anything
which would impair the coverage or enforceability of such lender s title insurance policy or the
accuracy of such attorney s opinion of title;

(xvi) There is no default, breach, violation or event of acceleration existing
under the Mortgage or the Promissory Note and no event which, with the passage of time or with
notice and the expiration of any grace or cure period, would constitute a default, breach,
violation or event of acceleration and neither the Loan Originator nor any affiliate has not waived
any default, breach, violation or event of acceleration;

(xvii) There are no mechanics  or similar liens or claims which have been filed
for work, labor or material (and no rights are outstanding that under law could give rise to such
lien) affecting the related Mortgaged Property which are or may be liens prior to, or equal or
coordinate with, the lien of the related Mortgage;

(xviii) All improvements which were considered in determining the Appraised Value
of the related Mortgaged Property lay wholly within the boundaries and building restriction lines
of the Mortgaged Property, and no improvements on adjoining properties encroach upon the Mortgaged
Property;

(xix) The Loan was originated by the Loan Originator or by a savings and loan
association, a savings bank, a commercial bank or similar banking institution which is supervised
and examined by a federal or state authority, or by a mortgagee approved as such by the Secretary
of HUD;

(xx) Payments on the Loan commenced no more than two months after the proceeds
of the Loan were disbursed. The Loan bears interest at the Loan Interest Rate. With respect to each
Loan unless otherwise stated on the Loan Schedule, the Promissory Note is payable on the first day
of each month in Monthly Payments, which, in the case of each fixed-rate Loan except for Balloon
Loans (to the extent permitted under the Pricing Side Letter), are sufficient to fully amortize the
original principal balance over the original term thereof and to pay interest at the related Loan
Interest Rate, and,

F-3

in the case of each ARM, are changed on each Adjustment Date in accordance with the terms of the
related Promissory Note or subsequent modifications, if any, and in any case, are sufficient to
fully amortize the original principal balance over the original term thereof and to pay interest at
the related Loan Interest Rate. The Promissory Note does not permit negative amortization. No Loan
is a Convertible Loan;

(xxi) The origination and collection practices used by the Loan Originator with
respect to each Promissory Note and Mortgage have been in all respects legal, proper, prudent and
customary in the mortgage origination and servicing industry. The Loan has been serviced by the
Loan Originator and any predecessor servicer in accordance with the terms of the Promissory Note.
With respect to escrow deposits and Escrow Payments, if any, all such payments are in the
possession of, or under the control of, the Loan Originator and there exist no deficiencies in
connection therewith for which customary arrangements for repayment thereof have not been made. No
escrow deposits or Escrow Payments or other charges or payments due the Loan Originator have been
capitalized under any Mortgage or the related Promissory Note and no such escrow deposits or Escrow
Payments are being held by the Loan Originator for any work on a Mortgaged Property which has not
been completed;

(xxii) The Mortgaged Property is free of material damage and waste and there is no
proceeding pending for the total or partial condemnation thereof;

(xxiii) The Mortgage contains an enforceable provision for the acceleration of the
payment of the unpaid principal balance of the Loan in the event that the Mortgaged Property is
sold or transferred without the prior written consent of the mortgagee thereunder. The Mortgage and
related Promissory Note contain customary and enforceable provisions such as to render the rights
and remedies of the holder thereof adequate for the realization against the Mortgaged Property of
the benefits of the security provided thereby, including, (a) in the case of a Mortgage designated
as a deed of trust, by trustee s sale, and (b) otherwise by judicial foreclosure. The Mortgaged
Property has not been subject to any bankruptcy proceeding or foreclosure proceeding and the
Borrower has not filed for protection under applicable bankruptcy laws. No material litigation or
lawsuit relating to the Loan is pending. There is no homestead or other exemption available to the
Borrower which would interfere with the right to sell the Mortgaged Property at a trustee s sale or
the right to foreclose the Mortgage. The Borrower has not notified the Loan Originator and the Loan
Originator has no knowledge of any relief requested or allowed to the Borrower under the
Servicemembers  Relief Act of 1940;

(xxiv) The Loan was underwritten in accordance with the Underwriting Guidelines in
effect at the time the Loan was originated; and the Promissory Note and Mortgage are on forms
acceptable to prudent mortgage lending institutions in the secondary market;

(xxv) The Promissory Note is not and has not been secured by any collateral except
the lien of the corresponding Mortgage on the Mortgaged Property and the security interest of any
applicable security agreement or chattel mortgage referred to in (ix) above;

(xxvi) The Loan File contains an appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property which
satisfied the standards of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and was made and signed, prior to the approval
of the Loan application, by a qualified appraiser, duly appointed by the Loan Originator, who had
no interest, direct or indirect in the Mortgaged Property or in any loan made on the security
thereof, whose compensation is not affected by the approval or disapproval of the Loan and who met
the minimum qualifications of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Each appraisal of the Loan was made in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and
Enforcement Act of 1989;

F-4

(xxvii) In the event the Mortgage constitutes a deed of trust, a trustee, duly
qualified under applicable law to serve as such, has been properly designated and currently so
serves and is named in the Mortgage, and no fees or expenses are or will become payable by the
Issuer to the trustee under the deed of trust, except in connection with a trustee s sale after
default by the Borrower;

(xxviii) No Loan contains provisions pursuant to which Monthly Payments are (a) paid
or partially paid with funds deposited in any separate account established by the Loan Originator,
the Borrower, or anyone on behalf of the Borrower, (b) paid by any source other than the Borrower
or (c) contains any other similar provisions which may constitute a  buydown  provision. The Loan
is not a graduated payment mortgage loan and the Loan does not have a shared appreciation or other
contingent interest feature;

(xxix) The Borrower has executed a statement to the effect that the Borrower has
received all disclosure materials required by applicable law with respect to the making of fixed
rate mortgage loans in the case of fixed-rate Loans, and adjustable rate mortgage loans in the case
of ARMs and rescission materials with respect to Refinanced Loans, and such statement is and will
remain in the Loan File;

(xxx) No Loan was made in connection with (a) the construction or rehabilitation
of a Mortgaged Property or (b) facilitating the trade-in or exchange of a Mortgaged Property;

(xxxi) The Loan Originator has no knowledge of any circumstances or condition with
respect to the Mortgage, the Mortgaged Property, the Borrower or the Borrower s credit standing
that can reasonably be expected to cause the Loan to be an unacceptable investment, cause the Loan
to become delinquent, or adversely affect the value of the Loan;

(xxxii) Each Loan listed on the Loan Schedule as being subject to a Primary Mortgage
Insurance Policy is and will be subject to a Primary Mortgage Insurance Policy, issued by a
Qualified Insurer, which insures that portion of the Loan in excess of the portion of the Appraised
Value of the Mortgaged Property required by Fannie Mae. All provisions of such Primary Insurance
Policy have been and are being complied with, such policy is in full force and effect, and all
premiums due thereunder have been paid. Any Mortgage subject to any such Primary Insurance Policy
obligates the Borrower thereunder to maintain such insurance and to pay all premiums and charges in
connection therewith. The Loan Interest Rate for the Loan does not include any such insurance
premium;

(xxxiii) The Mortgaged Property is lawfully occupied under applicable law; all
inspections, licenses and certificates required to be made or issued with respect to all occupied
portions of the Mortgaged Property and, with respect to the use and occupancy of the same,
including but not limited to certificates of occupancy, have been made or obtained from the
appropriate authorities;

(xxxiv) No error, omission, misrepresentation, negligence, fraud or similar

F-5

of the Mortgage securing the consolidated principal amount is expressly insured as having first or
second lien priority by a title insurance policy, an endorsement to the policy insuring the
mortgagee s consolidated interest or by other title evidence acceptable to Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac. The consolidated principal amount does not exceed the original principal amount of the Loan;

(xxxvii) Except as set forth on the Loan Schedule, no Loan is a Balloon Loan;

of twelve 30-day months;

(xl) The Mortgaged Property is in material compliance with all applicable

(xlvi) The Loan has been acquired, serviced, collected and otherwise dealt with by
the Loan Originator and any affiliate of the Loan Originator in compliance with all applicable
federal, state and local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, all applicable
predatory and abusive lending laws and the terms of the related Promissory Note and Mortgage. No
Loan is subject to any federal, state or local law or ordinance that would result in such Loan

Protection Act of 1994 as amended ( HOEPA ), (b) a  high cost  mortgage loan,  covered  mortgage
loan or  predatory  mortgage loan or any similarly classified loan using different terminology, no
matter how defined under any federal, state or local law imposing heightened regulatory scrutiny or
assignee liability to holders of such mortgage loans, or (c) a High Cost Loan or Covered Loan, as
applicable (as such terms are defined in the current Standard   Poor s LEVELS    Glossary Revised,
Appendix E);

(xlix) No predatory, abusive, or deceptive lending practices, including but not
limited to, the extension of credit to a mortgagor without regard for the mortgagor s ability to
repay the Loan and the extension of credit to a mortgagor which has no apparent benefit to the
mortgagor, were employed by the Loan Originator in connection with the origination of the Loan.
Except with respect to escrow deposits, each Points and Fees Loan is in compliance with the
anti-predatory lending eligibility for purchase requirements of the Fannie Mae selling guide;

(l) Points, fees and charges related to each Loan (whether or not financed,
assessed, collected or to be collected in connection with the origination and servicing of each
Loan) were disclosed in writing to the mortgagor in accordance with applicable state and federal
law and regulation. Unless otherwise disclosed on the related Loan Schedule, no mortgagor was
charged  points and fees  (whether or not financed) in an amount greater than 5% of the principal
amount of the related Loan, such 5% limitation is calculated in accordance with Fannie Mae s
anti-predatory lending requirements as set forth in the Fannie Mae selling guide;

(li) Each Wet Funded Loan was funded under a Closing Protection Letter, to
the extent required by the Loan Originator s on-line guidelines with respect to Closing Protection
Letters. The Loan Originator will provide a copy of such Closing Protection Letter to Noteholder
Agent upon request.

EXHIBIT G

SERVICING ADDENDUM

Section 4.01    Duties of the Servicer   . 

The Servicer, as independent contract servicer, shall service and administer the Loans in
accordance with this Agreement and shall have full power and authority, acting alone, to do or
cause to be done any and all things in connection with such servicing and administration which the
Servicer may deem necessary or desirable and consistent with the terms of this Agreement.

The duties of the Servicer shall include collecting and posting of all payments, responding to
inquiries of Borrowers or by federal, state or local government authorities with respect to the
Loans, investigating delinquencies, reporting tax information to Borrowers in accordance with its
customary practices and accounting for collections and furnishing monthly and annual statements to
the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholder Agent, with respect to distributions, making Servicing
Advances and Monthly Advances pursuant hereto. The Servicer shall follow its customary standards,
policies and procedures in performing its duties as Servicer. The Servicer shall cooperate with the
Indenture Trustee and furnish to the Indenture Trustee with reasonable promptness information in
its possession as may be necessary or appropriate to enable the Indenture Trustee to perform its
tax reporting duties hereunder, if any.

The Servicer shall give prompt notice to the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholder Agent of any
Proceeding, of which the Servicer has actual knowledge, to (i) assert a claim against the Trust or
(ii) assert jurisdiction over the Trust.

In the event of a Disposition or other removal of a Loan from the Trust Estate, the Servicer s
obligations under this Agreement shall be terminated with respect to such Loan.

The Servicer agrees that in the event that any Notes are outstanding after the applicable
Maturity Date, the Majority Noteholders may appoint a successor servicer in accordance with the
provisions of Section 9.02. The Majority Noteholders may, by written notice to the Servicer and the
Indenture Trustee, elect to have the Servicer continue its duties hereunder after such Maturity
Date.

Consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Servicer may waive, modify or vary any term
of any Loan or consent to the postponement of strict compliance with any such term or in any manner
grant indulgence to any Borrower if in the Servicer s reasonable and prudent determination such
waiver, modification, postponement or indulgence is not materially adverse to the Issuer or the
Noteholders; provided, however, that the Servicer shall not permit any modification with respect to
any Loan that would change the Loan Interest Rate, defer or forgive the payment thereof or of any
principal or interest payments, reduce the outstanding principal amount (except for actual payments
of principal), make additional advances of additional principal or extend the final maturity date
on such Loan. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer shall continue, and is
hereby authorized and empowered, to execute and deliver on behalf of itself, and the Issuer, all
instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release, discharge and all other
comparable instruments, with respect to the Loans and with respect to the Mortgaged Property. If
reasonably required by the Servicer, the Issuer shall furnish the Servicer with any powers of
attorney and other documents necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer to carry out its
servicing and administrative duties under this Agreement.

The Servicer shall service and administer the Loans in accordance with Accepted Servicing
Practices.

G-1

Section 4.02    Collection of Loan Payments   . 

Continuously from the date hereof until the principal and interest on all Loans are paid in
full, the Servicer shall proceed diligently to collect all payments due under each Loan when the
same shall become due and payable and shall, to the extent such procedures shall be consistent with
this Agreement and the terms and provisions of any related Primary Insurance Policy, follow such
collection procedures as it follows with respect to mortgage loans comparable to the Loans and held
for its own account. Further, the Servicer shall take special care in ascertaining and estimating
annual ground rents, taxes, assessments, water rates, fire and hazard insurance premiums, mortgage
insurance premiums, and all other charges that, as provided in the Mortgage, will become due and
payable to the end that the installments payable by the Borrowers will be sufficient to pay such
charges as and when they become due and payable.

Section 4.03     Realization Upon Defaulted Loans   . 

(a) The Servicer shall use its best efforts, consistent with the procedures that the
Servicer would use in servicing loans for its own account, to foreclose upon or otherwise
comparably convert the ownership of such Mortgaged Properties as come into and continue in default
and as to which no satisfactory arrangements can be made for collection of delinquent payments
pursuant to Section 4.01. The Servicer shall use its best efforts to realize upon Defaulted Loans
in such a manner as will maximize the receipt of principal and interest by the Issuer, taking into
account, among other things, the timing of foreclosure proceedings; provided, however, that the
Servicer shall not sell any Defaulted Loan unless it has been directed to do so by the Majority
Noteholder. The foregoing is subject to the provisions that, in any case in which Mortgaged
Property shall have suffered damage, the Servicer shall not be required to expend its own funds
toward the restoration of such property in excess of $2,000 unless it shall determine in its
discretion (i) that such restoration will increase the proceeds of liquidation of the related Loan
to the Issuer after reimbursement to itself for such expenses, and (ii) that such expenses will be
recoverable by the Servicer through Mortgage Insurance Proceeds or Liquidation Proceeds from the
related Mortgaged Property. In the event that any payment due under any Loan is not paid when the
same becomes due and payable, or in the event the Borrower fails to perform any other covenant or
obligation under the Loan and such failure continues beyond any applicable grace period, the
Servicer shall take such action as it shall deem to be in the best interest of the Issuer and the
Noteholders. The Servicer shall notify the Issuer and the Noteholders in writing of the
commencement of foreclosure proceedings. In such connection, the Servicer shall be responsible for
all costs and expenses incurred by it in any such proceedings; provided, however, that it shall be
entitled to reimbursement thereof from the related Mortgaged Property.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.03, with respect to
any Loan as to which the Servicer has received actual notice of, or has actual knowledge of, the
presence of any toxic or hazardous substance on the related Mortgaged Property the Servicer shall
not either (i) obtain title to such Mortgaged Property as a result of or in lieu of foreclosure or
otherwise, or (ii) otherwise acquire possession of, or take any other action, with respect to, such
Mortgaged Property if, as a result of any such action, the Issuer would be considered to hold title
to, to be a mortgagee-in-possession of, or to be an owner or operator of such Mortgaged Property
within the meaning of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of
1980, as amended from time to time, or any comparable law, unless the Servicer has also previously
determined, based on its reasonable judgment and a prudent report prepared by a Person who
regularly conducts environmental audits using customary industry standards, that:

(1) such Mortgaged Property is in compliance with applicable environmental
laws or, if not, that it would be in the best economic interest of the Issuer and the
Noteholders to take such actions as are necessary to bring the Mortgaged Property into
compliance therewith; and

G-2

(2) there are no circumstances present at such Mortgaged Property relating to
the use, management or disposal of any hazardous substances, hazardous materials,
hazardous wastes, or petroleum-based materials for which investigation, testing,
monitoring, containment, clean-up or remediation could be required under any federal,
state or local law or regulation, or that if any such materials are present for which
such action could be required, that it would be in the best economic interest of the
Issuer and the Noteholders to take such actions with respect to the affected Mortgaged
Property.

The cost of the environmental audit report contemplated by this Section 4.03 shall be advanced
by the Servicer, subject to the Servicer s right to be reimbursed therefor from the Collection
Account as provided in Section 5.01(c).

If the Servicer determines, as described above, that it is in the best economic interest of
the Issuer and the Noteholders to take such actions as are necessary to bring any such Mortgaged
Property into compliance with applicable environmental laws, or to take such action with respect to
the containment, clean-up or remediation of hazardous substances, hazardous materials, hazardous
wastes, or petroleum-based materials affecting any such Mortgaged Property, then the Servicer shall
take such action as it deems to be in the best economic interest of the Issuer and the Noteholders.
The cost of any such compliance, containment, cleanup or remediation shall be advanced by the
Servicer, subject to the Servicer s right to be reimbursed therefor from the Collection Account as
provided in Section 5.01(c).

(c) The Servicer shall determine, with respect to each Defaulted Loan, when it has
recovered, whether through trustee s sale, foreclosure sale or otherwise, all amounts it expects to
recover from or on account of such Defaulted Loan, whereupon such Loan shall become a  Liquidated
Loan  and shall promptly deliver to the Noteholder Agent a related liquidation report with respect
to such Liquidated Loan.

Section 4.04    Establishment of Escrow Accounts; Deposits in Escrow Accounts   . 

The Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected and received pursuant to each Loan
which constitute Escrow Payments separate and apart from any of its own funds and general assets
and shall establish and maintain one or more Escrow Accounts, in accordance with the related
Mortgage and applicable law.

The Servicer shall deposit in the Escrow Account or Accounts within two (2) Business Days
after receipt, and retain therein, (i) all Escrow Payments collected on account of the Loans, for
the purpose of effecting timely payment of any such items as required under the terms of this
Agreement, and (ii) all Mortgage Insurance Proceeds which are to be applied to the restoration or
repair of any Mortgaged Property. The Servicer shall make withdrawals therefrom only to effect such
payments as are required under this Agreement, and for such other purposes as shall be as set forth
or in accordance with Section 4.06. The Servicer shall be entitled to retain any interest paid on
funds deposited in the Escrow Account by the depository institution other than interest on escrowed
funds required by law to be paid to the Borrower and, to the extent required by law, the Servicer
shall pay interest on escrowed funds to the Borrower notwithstanding that the Escrow Account is
non-interest bearing or that interest paid thereon is insufficient for such purposes.

Section 4.05     Permitted Withdrawals From Escrow Account   . 

Withdrawals from the Escrow Account may be made by the Servicer (i) to effect timely payments
of ground rents, taxes, assessments, water rates, hazard insurance premiums, Primary Insurance
Policy premiums, if applicable, and comparable items, (ii) to reimburse the Servicer for any
Servicing Advance made by the Servicer with respect to a related Loan but only from amounts
received on the related Loan

G-3

which represent late payments or collections of Escrow Payments thereunder, (iii) to refund to the
Borrower any funds as may be determined to be overages, (iv) for transfer to the Collection Account
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (v) for application to restoration or repair of the
Mortgaged Property, (vi) to pay to the Servicer, or to the Borrower to the extent required by law,
any interest paid on the funds deposited in the Escrow Account, or (vii) to clear and terminate the
Escrow Account on the termination of this Agreement.

Section 4.06    Payment of Taxes, Insurance and Other
Charges; Maintenance of Primary Insurance
Policies; Collections Thereunder   . 

With respect to each Loan, the Servicer shall maintain accurate records reflecting the status
of ground rents, taxes, assessments, water rates and other charges which are or may become a lien
upon the Mortgaged Property and the status of Primary Insurance Policy premiums and fire and hazard
insurance coverage and shall obtain, from time to time, all bills for the payment of such charges,
including insurance renewal premiums and shall effect payment thereof prior to the applicable
penalty or termination date and at a time appropriate for securing maximum discounts allowable,
employing for such purpose deposits of the Borrower in the Escrow Account which shall have been
estimated and accumulated by the Servicer in amounts sufficient for such purposes, as allowed under
the terms of the Mortgage and applicable law. To the extent that the Mortgage does not provide for
Escrow Payments, the Servicer shall determine that any such insurance premium payments are made by
the Borrower at the time they first become due and any such tax payments are made in time to avoid
loss of the Mortgaged Property in a tax sale. The Servicer assumes full responsibility for the
timely payment of all such bills and shall effect payments of all such bills prior to the
termination of any such insurance coverage or loss of any such Mortgaged Property in a tax sale
irrespective of the Borrower s faithful performance in the payment of same or the making of the
Escrow Payments and shall make advances from its own funds to effect such payments.

The Servicer shall maintain in full force and effect, a Primary Insurance Policy, issued by a
Qualified Insurer, with respect to each Loan for which such coverage is required. Such coverage
shall be maintained until the Loan-to-Value Ratio of the related Loan is reduced to that amount for
which Fannie Mae no longer requires such insurance to be maintained. The Servicer will not cancel
or refuse to renew any Primary Insurance Policy, if any, in effect on the Closing Date that is
required to be kept in force under this Agreement unless a replacement Primary Insurance Policy, if
any, for such canceled or non-renewed policy is obtained from and maintained with a Qualified
Insurer. The Servicer shall not take any action which would result in non-coverage under any
applicable Primary Insurance Policy of any loss which, but for the actions of the Servicer, would
have been covered thereunder. In connection with any assumption or substitution agreement entered
into or to be entered into pursuant to Section 4.12, the Servicer shall promptly notify the insurer
under the related Primary Insurance Policy, if any, of such assumption or substitution of liability
in accordance with the terms of such policy and shall take all actions which may be required by
such insurer as a condition to the continuation of coverage under the Primary Insurance Policy, if
any. If such Primary Insurance Policy is terminated as a result of such assumption or substitution
of liability, the Servicer shall obtain a replacement Primary Insurance Policy as provided above.

In connection with its activities as servicer, the Servicer agrees to prepare and present, on
behalf of itself, the Issuer and the Noteholders, claims to the insurer under any Primary Insurance
Policy in a timely fashion in accordance with the terms of such policies and, in this regard, to
take such action as shall be necessary to permit recovery under any Primary Insurance Policy
respecting a defaulted Loan. Pursuant to Section 5.01, any amounts collected by the Servicer under
any Primary Insurance Policy shall be deposited in the Collection Account.

G-4

Section 4.07    Transfer of Accounts   . 

The Servicer may transfer the Collection Account or the Escrow Account to a different
depository institution from time to time. Such transfer shall be made only upon obtaining the
consent of the Noteholder Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In
any case, the Collection Account and the Escrow Account shall be an Eligible Account.

Section 4.08   Maintenance of Hazard Insurance   . 

The Servicer shall cause to be maintained for each Loan fire and hazard insurance with
extended coverage as is customary in the area where the Mortgaged Property is located in an amount
which is at least equal to the lesser of (i) 100% of the maximum insurable value of the
improvements securing the Loan or (ii) the outstanding principal balance of the Loan, in each
case in an amount not less than such amount as is necessary to prevent the Borrower and/or the
Issuer from becoming a co- insurer. If the Mortgaged Property is in an area identified on a Flood
Hazard Boundary Map or Flood Insurance Rate Map issued by the Flood Emergency Management Agency as
having special flood hazards and such flood insurance has been made available, the Servicer will
cause to be maintained a flood insurance policy meeting the requirements of the current guidelines
of the Federal Insurance Administration with a generally acceptable insurance carrier, in an amount
representing coverage not less than the lesser of (i) the outstanding principal balance of the Loan
or (ii) the maximum amount of insurance which is available under the National Flood Insurance Act
of 1968 or the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended. The Servicer also shall maintain
on any Foreclosure Property, fire and hazard insurance with extended coverage in an amount which is
at least equal to the lesser of (i) 100% of the maximum insurable value of the improvements which
are a part of such property and (ii) the outstanding principal balance of the related Loan at the
time it became a Foreclosure Property, liability insurance and, to the extent required and
available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 or the Flood Disaster Protection Act of
1973, as amended, flood insurance in an amount as provided above. Pursuant to Section 5.01, any
amounts collected by the Servicer under any such policies other than amounts to be deposited in the
Escrow Account and applied to the restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property or Foreclosure
Property, or released to the Borrower in accordance with the Servicer s normal servicing
procedures, shall be deposited in the Collection Account, subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section
5.01. Any cost incurred by the Servicer in maintaining any such insurance shall not, for the
purpose of calculating distributions to the Issuer or the Noteholders, be added to the unpaid
principal balance of the related Loan, notwithstanding that the terms of such Loan so permit. It is
understood and agreed that no earthquake or other additional insurance need be required by the
Servicer or the Borrower or maintained on property acquired in respect of the Loan, other than
pursuant to such applicable laws and regulations as shall at any time be in force and as shall
require such additional insurance. All such policies shall be endorsed with standard mortgagee
clauses with loss payable to the Servicer, or upon the direction of the Noteholder Agent to the
Indenture Trustee, and shall provide for at least thirty days prior written notice of any
cancellation, reduction in the amount of, or material change in, coverage to the Servicer. The
Servicer shall not interfere with the Borrower s freedom of choice in selecting either his
insurance carrier or agent, provided, however, that the Servicer shall not accept any such
insurance policies from insurance companies unless such companies currently reflect a General
Policy Rating of B:III or better in Best s Key Rating Guide and are licensed to do business in the
state wherein the property subject to the policy is located.

Section 4.09    Maintenance of Mortgage Impairment Insurance Policy   . 

In the event that the Servicer shall obtain and maintain a mortgage impairment or blanket
policy issued by an issuer that has a Best rating of B:III insuring against hazard losses on all of
Mortgaged Properties securing the Loans, then, to the extent such policy provides coverage in an
amount equal to the

G-5

amount required pursuant to Section 4.08 and otherwise complies with all other requirements of
Section 4.08, the Servicer shall conclusively be deemed to have satisfied its obligations as set
forth in Section 4.08, it being understood and agreed that such policy may contain a deductible
clause, in which case the Servicer shall, in the event that there shall not have been maintained on
the related Mortgaged Property or Foreclosure Property a policy complying with Section 4.08, and
there shall have been one or more losses which would have been covered by such policy, deposit in
the Collection Account the amount not otherwise payable under the blanket policy because of such
deductible clause. In connection with its activities as servicer of the Loans, the Servicer agrees
to prepare and present, on behalf of the Issuer and the Noteholders, claims under any such blanket
policy in a timely fashion in accordance with the terms of such policy. Upon request of the
Noteholder Agent, the Servicer shall cause to be delivered to the Noteholders a certified true copy
of such policy and a statement from the insurer thereunder that such policy shall in no event be
terminated or materially modified without thirty days prior written notice to the Issuer and the
Noteholders.

Section 4.10     Fidelity Bond, Errors and Omissions Insurance   . 

The Servicer shall maintain, at its own expense, a blanket fidelity bond and an errors and
omissions insurance policy, with broad coverage with financially responsible companies on all
officers, employees or other persons acting in any capacity with regard to the Loans to handle
funds, money, documents and papers relating to the Loans. The fidelity bond and errors and
omissions insurance shall be in the form of the Mortgage Banker s Blanket Bond and shall protect
and insure the Servicer against losses, including forgery, theft, embezzlement, fraud, errors and
omissions and negligent acts of such persons. Such fidelity bond shall also protect and insure the
Servicer against losses in
connection with the failure to maintain any insurance policies required pursuant to this
Agreement and the release or satisfaction of a Loan without having obtained payment in full of the
indebtedness secured thereby. No provision of this Section 4.10 requiring the fidelity bond and
errors and omissions insurance shall diminish or relieve the Servicer from its duties and
obligations as set forth in this Agreement. The minimum coverage under any such bond and insurance
policy shall be at least equal to the corresponding amounts required by Fannie Mae in the Fannie
Mae Servicing Guide or by Freddie Mac in the Freddie Mac Sellers  and Servicers  Guide. Upon
request of the Noteholder Agent, the Servicer shall cause to be delivered to the Noteholders a
certified true copy of the fidelity bond and insurance policy and a statement from the surety and
the insurer that such fidelity bond or insurance policy shall in no event be terminated or
materially modified without thirty days  prior written notice to the Noteholder Agent.

Section 4.11    Title, Management and Disposition of Foreclosure Property   . 

In the event that title to the Mortgaged Property is acquired in foreclosure or by deed in
lieu of foreclosure, the deed or certificate of sale shall be taken in the name of the person
designated by the Issuer, or in the event such person is not authorized or permitted to hold title
to real property in the state where the Foreclosure Property is located, or would be adversely
affected under the  doing business  or tax laws of such state by so holding title, the deed or
certificate of sale shall be taken in the name of such Person or Persons as shall be consistent
with an opinion of counsel obtained by the Servicer from an attorney duly licensed to practice law
in the state where the Foreclosure Property is located. Any Person or Persons holding such title
other than the Issuer shall acknowledge in writing that such title is being held as nominee for the
benefit of the Issuer and the Noteholders.

The Servicer shall either itself or through an agent selected by the Servicer, manage,
conserve, protect and operate each Foreclosure Property (and may temporarily rent the same) in the
same manner that it manages, conserves, protects and operates other foreclosed property for its own
account, and in the same manner that similar property in the same locality as the Foreclosure
Property is managed. If a REMIC election is or is to be made with respect to the arrangement under
which the Mortgage Loans and

G-6

any Foreclosure Property are held, the Servicer shall manage, conserve, protect and operate each
Foreclosure Property in a manner which does not cause such Foreclosure Property to fail to qualify
as  foreclosure property  within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code or result in the
receipt by such REMIC of any  income from non-permitted assets  within the meaning of Section
860F(a)(2)(B) of the Code or any  net income from foreclosure property  within the meaning of
Section 860G(c)(2) of the Code. The Servicer shall cause each Foreclosure Property to be inspected
promptly upon the acquisition of title thereto and shall cause each Foreclosure Property to be
inspected at least annually thereafter. The Servicer shall make or cause to be made a written
report of each such inspection. Such reports shall be retained in the Loan File and copies thereof
shall be forwarded by the Servicer to the Issuer. The Servicer shall use its best efforts to
dispose of the Foreclosure Property as soon as possible. The Servicer shall report monthly to the
Issuer and the Noteholders as to the progress being made in selling such Foreclosure Property, and
if, with the written consent of the Noteholder Agent, a purchase money mortgage is taken in
connection with such sale, such purchase money mortgage shall name the Servicer as mortgagee, and a
separate servicing agreement between the Servicer and the Issuer shall be entered into with respect
to such purchase money mortgage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a REMIC election is made with
respect to the arrangement under which the Loans and the Foreclosure Property are held, such
Foreclosure Property shall be disposed of within three years after the end of the tax year in which
such property becomes Foreclosure Property or such other period as may be permitted under Section
860G(a)(8) of the Code.

The final sale by the Servicer of any Foreclosure Property ( REO Disposition ) shall be
carried out by the Servicer at such price and upon such terms and conditions as the Servicer deems
to be in the best interest of the Issuer and the Noteholders only with the prior written consent of
the Noteholder Agent. If as of the date title to any Foreclosure Property was acquired by the
Issuer there were outstanding unreimbursed Servicing Advances with respect to the Foreclosure
Property, the Servicer, upon an REO Disposition of such Foreclosure Property, shall be entitled to
reimbursement for any related unreimbursed Servicing Advances from Liquidation Proceeds received in
connection with such REO Disposition. The Net Liquidation Proceeds from the REO Disposition shall
be deposited in the Collection Account promptly following receipt thereof for distribution on the
succeeding Payment Date in accordance with Section 5.01.

Section 4.12    Assumption Agreements   . 

The Servicer shall, to the extent it has knowledge of any conveyance or prospective conveyance
by any Borrower of the Mortgaged Property (whether by absolute conveyance or by contract of sale,
and whether or not the Borrower remains or is to remain liable under the Promissory Note and/or the
Mortgage), exercise its rights to accelerate the maturity of such Loan under any  due-on-sale 
clause applicable thereto; provided, however, that the Servicer shall not exercise any such rights
if prohibited by law from doing so or if the exercise of such rights would impair or threaten to
impair any recovery under the related Primary Insurance Policy, if any, and shall not be required
to exercise such rights if the transferee of the Mortgaged Property would qualify for an assumption
or substitution under the Servicer s underwriting guidelines. If the Servicer reasonably believes
it is unable under applicable law to enforce such  due-on-sale  clause, the Servicer shall enter
into an assumption agreement with the person to whom the Mortgaged Property has been conveyed or is
proposed to be conveyed, pursuant to which such person becomes liable under the Promissory Note
and, to the extent permitted by applicable state law, the Borrower remains liable thereon. Where an
assumption is allowed pursuant to this Section 4.12, the Servicer, with the prior written consent
of the insurer under the Primary Insurance Policy, if any, is authorized to enter into a
substitution of liability agreement with the person to whom the Mortgaged Property has been
conveyed or is proposed to be conveyed pursuant to which the original Borrower is released from
liability and such Person is substituted as Borrower and becomes liable under the related

G-7

Promissory Note. Any such substitution of liability agreement shall be in lieu of an assumption
agreement.

In connection with any such assumption or substitution of liability, the Servicer shall follow
the underwriting practices and procedures of prudent mortgage lenders in the state in which the
related Mortgaged Property is located. With respect to an assumption or substitution of liability,
Loan Interest Rate, the amount of the Monthly Payment, and the final maturity date of such
Promissory Note may not be changed. The Servicer shall notify the Issuer and the Noteholders that
any such substitution of liability or assumption agreement has been completed and shall forward to
the Custodian the original of any such substitution of liability or assumption agreement, which
document shall be added to the related Loan File and shall, for all purposes, be considered a part
of such Loan File to the same extent as all other documents and instruments constituting a part
thereof. Any fee collected by the Servicer for entering into an assumption or substitution of
liability agreement shall be deemed additional Servicing Compensation.

Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs of this Section or any other provision of this
Agreement, the Servicer shall not be deemed to be in default, breach or any other violation of its
obligations hereunder by reason of any assumption of a Loan by operation of law or any assumption
which the Servicer may be restricted by law from preventing, for any reason whatsoever. For
purposes of this Section 4.12, the term  assumption  is deemed to also include a sale of the
Mortgaged Property subject to the Mortgage that is not accompanied by an assumption or substitution
of liability agreement.

Section 4.13    Satisfaction of Mortgages and Release of Loan Files   . 

Upon the payment in full of any Loan, or the receipt by the Servicer of a notification that
payment in full will be escrowed in a manner customary for such purposes, the Servicer will
immediately notify the Issuer and the Noteholder Agent by a certification of a servicing officer of
the Servicer (a  Servicing Officer ), which certification shall include a statement to the effect
that all amounts received or to be received in connection with such payment which are required to
be deposited in the Collection Account pursuant to Section 5.01 have been or will be so deposited,
and shall request execution of any document necessary to satisfy the Loan and delivery to it of the
portion of the Loan File held by Custodian. Upon receipt of a Request for Release and Receipt (as
defined in the Custodial Agreement), the Custodian shall promptly release the related mortgage
documents to the Servicer in accordance with the Custodial Agreement and the Servicer shall prepare
and process any satisfaction or release. No expense incurred in connection with any instrument of
satisfaction or deed of reconveyance shall be chargeable to the Collection Account or the Issuer.

In the event the Servicer satisfies or releases a Mortgage without having obtained payment in
full of the indebtedness secured by the Mortgage or should it otherwise prejudice any right the
Issuer or the Noteholders may have under the mortgage instruments, the Servicer, upon
written demand, shall remit to the Issuer the then outstanding principal balance of the
related Loan by deposit thereof in the Collection Account. The Servicer shall maintain the fidelity
bond insuring the Servicer against any loss it may sustain with respect to any Loan not satisfied
in accordance with the procedures set forth herein.

From time to time and as appropriate for the servicing or foreclosure of the Loan, including
for this purpose collection under any Primary Insurance Policy, the Custodian shall, upon request
of the Servicer and delivery to the Custodian of a servicing receipt signed by a Servicing Officer,
release the requested portion of the Loan File held by the Custodian to the Servicer. Such
servicing receipt shall obligate the Servicer to return the related Mortgage documents to the
Custodian when the need therefor by the Servicer no longer exists, unless the Loan has been
liquidated and the Liquidation Proceeds relating to the Loan have been deposited in the Collection
Account or the Loan File or such document has been delivered to an attorney, or to a public trustee
or other public official as required by law, for

G-8

purposes of initiating or pursuing legal action or other proceedings for the foreclosure of the
Mortgaged Property either judicially or non judicially, and the Servicer has delivered to the
Custodian a certificate of a Servicing Officer certifying as to the name and address of the Person
to which such Loan File or such document was delivered and the purpose or purposes of such
delivery. Upon receipt of a certificate of a Servicing Officer stating that such Loan was
liquidated, the servicing receipt shall be released by the Custodian to the Servicer.

Section 4.14    Advances by the Servicer   . 

(a) Not later than the close of business on the Business Day preceding each
Remittance Date, the Servicer shall deposit in the Collection Account an amount equal to all
payments not previously advanced by the Servicer, whether or not deferred pursuant to Section 4.01,
of principal (due after the Transfer Cut-off Date) and interest not allocable to the period prior
to the Transfer Cut-off Date, at the Loan Interest Rate net of the Servicing Fee, which were due on
a Loan and delinquent at the close of business on the related Remittance Date; provided, however,

Collection Account on that Remittance Date (exclusive of any Monthly Advance required to be
effected pursuant to this Section 4.14) is at least sufficient to fund in full the items described
in Sections 5.01(c)(3)(i) through 5.01(c)(3)(vi) hereof on the related Payment Date, and, if the
amount on deposit in the Collection Account is less than the sum of such items, the Servicer shall
only be required to deposit an amount equal to the shortfall. The obligation of the Servicer to
make such Monthly Advances is mandatory, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
and, with respect to any Loan or Foreclosure Property, shall continue until a Final Recovery
Determination in connection therewith; provided that, notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, no Monthly Advance shall be required to be made hereunder by the Servicer if such Monthly
Advance would, if made, constitute a Nonrecoverable Monthly Advance. The determination by the

paid will constitute a  Servicing Advance.  The Servicer may recover Servicing Advances (x) from
the Borrowers to the extent permitted by the Loans, from Liquidation Proceeds realized upon the
liquidation of the related Loan and (y) as provided in Sections 5.01(c)(1)(ii) or 5.01(c)(3)(i)
hereof. In no case may the Servicer recover Servicing Advances from principal and interest payments

the Closing Date to the Issuer and the Depositor on which the same are relying in entering into
this Note Purchase Agreement.

enter into and perform its obligations under this Note Purchase Agreement and to consummate the
transactions herein contemplated. The execution and delivery by the Purchasers of this Note
Purchase Agreement and the consummation by the Purchasers of the transactions contemplated hereby
have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary organizational action on the part each
Purchaser. This Note Purchase Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the
Purchasers and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each Purchaser, enforceable
against each Purchaser in accordance with its terms, subject to enforcement of bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium and other similar laws of general applicability relating to
or affecting creditors  rights and to general principles of

10

equity. Neither the execution and delivery by the Purchasers of this Note Purchase Agreement nor
the consummation by the Purchasers of any of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor the
fulfillment by the Purchasers of the terms hereof, will conflict with, or violate, result in a
breach of or constitute a default under any term or provision of such Purchaser s organizational
documents or any Governmental Rule applicable to such Purchaser.

SECTION 6.03    Securities Act   .  The Purchasers hereby represents and warrants to the
Issuer and the Depositor as of the date of this Note Purchase Agreement, as follows:

(a) Each Purchaser has such knowledge and experience in financial and

in the Note. Each Purchaser (i) is (A) a  qualified institutional buyer  as defined under Rule 144A
promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  1933 Act ), acting for its own
account or the accounts of other  qualified institutional buyers  as defined under Rule 144A, or
(B) an  accredited investor  within the meaning of Regulation D promulgated under the 1933 Act, and
(ii) is aware that the Issuer intends to rely on the exemption from registration requirements under

(b) Each Purchaser understands that neither the Note nor interests in the
Note have been registered or qualified under the 1933 Act, nor under the securities laws of any
state, and therefore neither the Note nor interests in the Note can be resold unless they are
registered or qualified thereunder or unless an exemption from registration or qualification is
available.

(c) It is the intention of each Purchaser to acquire interests in the Note
(a) for investment for its own account, or (b) for resale to  qualified institutional buyers  in
transactions under Rule 144A, and not in any event with the view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution thereof. The Purchasers understand that the Note and interests therein have
not been registered under the 1933 Act by reason of a specific exemption from the registration
provisions of the 1933 Act which depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of each
Purchaser s investment intent (or intent to resell only in Rule 144A transactions) as expressed
herein.

SECTION 6.04    Conflicts With Law   .  The execution, delivery and performance by each
Purchaser of its obligations under this Note Purchase Agreement will not result in a breach or
violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any agreement or
instrument to which each such Purchaser is a party or by which each such Purchaser is bound or of

therein.

SECTION 6.05    Conflicts With Agreements, etc   .  Each Purchaser is not in violation of its
organizational documents or in default under any agreement, indenture or instrument the effect of
which violation or default would be materially adverse to the Purchaser in the performance of its
obligations or duties under any of the Basic Documents to which it is a party. Each Purchaser is
not a party to, bound by or in breach or violation of any indenture or other agreement or
instrument, or subject to or in violation of any statute, order or regulation of any court,
regulatory body, administrative agency or governmental body having jurisdiction over each such
Purchaser that materially and adversely affects, the ability of each Purchaser to perform its
obligations under this Note Purchase Agreement.

delivery of such Notes or did not hold such offices at the date of such Notes.

Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in  Section 2.08  hereof, the
Indenture Trustee shall, upon Issuer Order, authenticate and deliver the Notes.

date of their authentication. The Notes shall be issued in such denominations as may be agreed by

authorized signatories, and such certificate upon any Note shall be conclusive evidence, and the
only evidence, that such Note has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.

Section 2.03.    Registration; Registration of Transfer and Exchange   .  The Issuer

reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Issuer shall provide for the registration of Notes
and the registration of transfers of Notes. The Indenture Trustee initially shall be the   Note
Registrar   for the purpose of registering Notes and transfers of Notes as herein provided. Upon
any resignation of any Note Registrar, the Issuer shall promptly

If a Person other than the Indenture Trustee is appointed by the Issuer as Note Registrar, the
Issuer will give the Indenture Trustee prompt written notice of the appointment of such Note
Registrar and of the location, and any change in the location, of the Note Register, and the
Indenture Trustee shall have the right to inspect the Note Register at all reasonable times and to
obtain copies thereof, and the Indenture Trustee shall have the right to rely upon a certificate
executed on behalf of the Note Registrar by an Executive Officer thereof as to the names and
addresses of the Noteholders and the principal amounts and number of the Notes.

Indenture Trustee, the Notes which the Noteholder making the exchange is entitled to receive.

8

All Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes shall be the valid

Indenture, as the Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

Every Note presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly
endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in the form attached to the form
of Note attached as Exhibit A hereto duly executed by the Holder thereof or such Holder s attorney
duly authorized in writing, with such signature guaranteed by an  eligible guarantor institution

Note is surrendered to the Indenture Trustee, or the Indenture Trustee receives evidence to its
satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Note, and (ii) there is delivered to the
Issuer and Indenture Trustee such security or indemnity as may reasonably be required by it to hold
the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee, as applicable, harmless, then, in the absence of notice to
the Issuer, the Note Registrar or the Indenture Trustee that such Note has been acquired by a bona
fide purchaser, an Authorized Officer of the Owner Trustee or
the Administrator on behalf of the Issuer shall execute, and upon its written request the
Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Note, a replacement Note; provided, however, that if any such destroyed,
lost or stolen Note, but not a mutilated Note, shall have become or within seven days shall be due
and payable, or shall have been called for redemption, instead of issuing a replacement Note, the
Issuer may pay such destroyed, lost or stolen Note when so due or payable or upon the Redemption
Date without surrender thereof. If, after the delivery of such replacement Note or payment of a
destroyed, lost or stolen Note pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, a bona fide
purchaser of the original Note in lieu of which such replacement Note was issued presents for
payment such original Note, the Issuer shall be entitled to recover such replacement Note (or such
payment) from the Person to which it was delivered or any Person taking such replacement Note from
such Person to which such replacement Note was delivered or any assignee of such Person, except a
bona fide purchaser, and the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to recover upon the
security or indemnity provided therefor to the extent of any loss, damage, cost or expense incurred
by the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee in connection therewith.

Upon the issuance of any replacement Note under this  Section 2.04 , the Issuer may
require the payment by the Holder of such Note of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses
(including the fees and expenses of the Indenture Trustee) connected therewith.

Every replacement Note issued pursuant to this  Section 2.04  in replacement of any
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original additional contractual
obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be at
any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally
and proportionately with any and all other Notes duly issued hereunder.

9

The provisions of this  Section 2.04  are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent
lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.

amounts as shall be sufficient to cover reasonable compensation to the Indenture Trustee,

reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any
Holder thereof or to authorize the Indenture Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any
Noteholder in any such proceeding except, as aforesaid, to vote for the election of a trustee in
bankruptcy or similar Person.

involving the interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the Indenture Trustee
shall be a

24

party), the Indenture Trustee shall be held to represent all the Noteholders, and it shall not be
necessary to make any Noteholder a party to any such Proceedings.

Section 5.04.    Remedies; Priorities   . 

(a) If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Indenture
Trustee, at the direction of the Majority Noteholders shall, do one or more of the following
(subject to  Section 5.05  hereof):

(i) institute Proceedings in its own name and as trustee of an express trust
for the collection of all amounts then payable on the Notes or under this Indenture with
respect thereto, whether by declaration or otherwise, enforce any judgment obtained, and
collect from the Issuer and any other obligor upon such Notes moneys adjudged due;

(ii) institute Proceedings from time to time for the complete or partial
foreclosure of this Indenture with respect to the Collateral;

(iii) exercise any remedies of a secured party under the UCC and take any
other appropriate action to protect and enforce the rights and remedies of the Indenture
Trustee or the Noteholders; and

(iv) sell the Collateral or any portion thereof or rights or interest therein
in a commercially reasonable manner, at one or more public or private sales called and
conducted in any manner permitted by law; provided, however, that the Indenture Trustee may
not sell or otherwise liquidate the Collateral following an Event of Default, unless (A)
the Holders of 100% Percentage Interests of the Outstanding Notes consent thereto, (B) the
proceeds of such sale or liquidation distributable to the Noteholders are sufficient to
discharge in full all amounts then due and unpaid upon such Notes for principal and/or
interest or (C) the Indenture Trustee determines that the Collateral will not continue to
provide sufficient funds for the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes as they
would have become due if the Notes had not been declared due and payable, and the Indenture
Trustee obtains the consent of Holders of not less than 66-2/3% Percentage Interests of the
Outstanding Notes. In determining such sufficiency or insufficiency with respect to clause
(B) and (C) of this subsection (a)(iv), the Indenture Trustee may, but need not, obtain and
rely upon an opinion of an Independent investment banking or accounting firm of national
reputation as to the feasibility of such proposed action and as to the sufficiency of the
Collateral for such purpose.

(b) If the Indenture Trustee collects any money or property pursuant to this
 Article V , it shall pay out the money or property in the following order:

FIRST: in the following order of priority: (a) to the Indenture Trustee, an amount
equal to all unreimbursed Indenture Trustee Fees and indemnities and any other amounts
payable to the
Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Basic Documents and to the Indenture Trustee or Sale
Agents, as applicable, all reasonable fees and expenses incurred by them and their agents
and representatives in connection with the enforcement of the remedies provided for in this
 Article V , (b) to the Custodian, an amount equal to all unpaid Custodian Fees and
indemnities and any other amounts payable to the Custodian pursuant to the Basic Documents,
(c) to the Owner Trustee, an amount equal to all unreimbursed Owner Trustee Fees and
indemnities and any other amounts payable to the Owner Trustee pursuant to the Basic
Documents, and (d) to the Servicer, an amount equal to (i) all unreimbursed Servicing
Compensation and (ii) all unreimbursed Nonrecoverable Servicing Advances;

25

SECOND: the Hedge Funding Requirement to the appropriate Hedging Counterparties (if
any);

THIRD: to the Noteholders  pro rata , all amounts in respect of interest due and
owing under the Notes;

FOURTH: to the Noteholders  pro rata , all amounts in respect of unpaid
principal of the Notes;

FIFTH: to the Purchasers or any other Indemnified Party (as each such term is defined
in the Note Purchase Agreement), amounts in respect of Issuer/Depositor Indemnities (as
defined in the Trust Agreement) and to the Noteholder Agent, amounts in respect of Due
Diligence Fees (as set forth in  Section 11.15  of the Sale and Servicing Agreement)
until such amounts are paid in full;

SIXTH: to the Owner Trustee, for any amounts to be distributed pro rata to the holders
of the Trust Certificates pursuant to the Trust Agreement.

The Indenture Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to be made to the
Noteholders pursuant to this  Section 5.04 . At least 15 days before such record date, the
Indenture Trustee shall mail to each Noteholder and the Issuer a notice that states the record
date, the payment date and the amount to be paid.

Section 5.05.    Optional Preservation of the Collateral   .  If the Notes have been
declared to be due and payable under  Section 5.02  hereof following an Event of Default and
such declaration and its consequences have not been rescinded and annulled, the Indenture Trustee
may, but need not, elect to maintain possession of the Collateral. It is the desire of the parties
hereto and the Noteholders that there be at all times sufficient funds for the payment of principal
of and interest on the Notes, and the Indenture Trustee shall take such desire into account when
determining whether or not to maintain possession of the Collateral. In determining whether to
maintain possession of the Collateral, the Indenture Trustee may, but need not, obtain and rely
upon an opinion of an Independent investment banking or accounting firm of national reputation as
to the feasibility of such proposed action and as to the sufficiency of the Collateral for such
purpose.

Section 5.06.    Limitation of Suits   .  No Noteholder shall have any right to
institute any Proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture or for the
appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:

(a) such Noteholder has previously given written notice to the Indenture Trustee of
a continuing Event of Default;

(b) the Noteholders evidencing not less than 25% Percentage Interests of the
Outstanding Notes have made written request to the Indenture Trustee to institute such Proceeding
in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Indenture Trustee hereunder;

(c) such Noteholder or Noteholders have offered to the Indenture Trustee reasonable
indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in complying with such
request;

(d) the Indenture Trustee for 30 days after its receipt of such notice, request and
offer of indemnity has failed to institute such Proceeding; and

26

(e) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the
Indenture Trustee during such 30-day period by the Majority Noteholders.

It is understood and intended that no one or more Noteholders shall have any right in any
manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb
or prejudice the rights of any other Noteholders or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or
preference over any other Noteholders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the
manner herein provided.

In the event the Indenture Trustee shall receive conflicting or inconsistent requests and
indemnity from two or more groups of Noteholders, neither of which evidences Percentage Interests
of the Outstanding Notes greater than 50%, the Indenture Trustee in its sole discretion may
determine what action, if any, shall be taken, notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Indenture and shall have no obligation or liability to any such group of Noteholders for such
action or inaction.

Section 5.07.    Unconditional Rights of Noteholders to Receive Principal and/or
Interest   .  Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Indenture, any Noteholder shall have the
right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and interest, if
any, on such Note on or after the applicable Maturity Date thereof expressed in such Note or in
this Indenture (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date) and to institute
suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right shall not be impaired without the
consent of such Noteholder.

Section 5.08.    Restoration of Rights and Remedies   .  If the Indenture Trustee or any
Noteholder has instituted any Proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and
such Proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason or has been determined adversely
to the Indenture Trustee or to such Noteholder, then and in every such case the Issuer, the
Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders shall, subject to any determination in such Proceeding, be
restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights
and remedies of the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders shall continue as though no such
Proceeding had been instituted.

Section 5.09.    Rights and Remedies Cumulative   .  No right or remedy herein conferred
upon or reserved to the Indenture Trustee or to the Noteholders is intended to be exclusive of any
other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be
cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy
hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other
appropriate right or remedy.

Section 5.10.    Delay or Omission Not a Waiver   .  No delay or omission of the
Indenture Trustee or any Noteholder to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Default or
Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Default
or Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article V or
by law to the Indenture Trustee or to the Noteholders may be exercised from time to time, and as
often as may be deemed expedient, by the Indenture Trustee or by the Noteholders, as the case may
be.

Section 5.11.    Control by Noteholders   .  The Majority Noteholders shall have the
right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any Proceeding for any remedy available to
the Indenture Trustee with respect to the Notes or exercising any trust or power conferred on the
Indenture Trustee; provided, however, that:

(a) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture;

27

(b) subject to the express terms of  Section 5.04(a)(iv)  hereof, any
direction to the Indenture Trustee to sell or liquidate the Collateral shall be by Noteholders
representing Percentage Interests of the Outstanding Notes of not less than 100%;

(c) if the conditions set forth in  Section 5.05  hereof have been satisfied
and the Indenture Trustee elects to retain the Collateral pursuant to such Section, then any
direction to the Indenture Trustee by Noteholders representing Percentage Interests of the
Outstanding Notes of less than 100% to sell or liquidate the Collateral shall be of no force and
effect; and

(d) the Indenture Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Indenture
Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction.

In connection with any sale of the Collateral in accordance with paragraph (c) above, the
Majority Noteholders may, in their sole discretion appoint agents to effect the sale of the
Collateral (such agents,   Sale Agents  ), which Sale Agents may be Affiliates of any
Noteholder. The Sale Agents shall be entitled to reasonable compensation in connection with such
activities from the proceeds of such sale.

Notwithstanding the rights of the Noteholders set forth in this  Section 5.11 , subject
to  Section 6.01  hereof, the Indenture Trustee need not take any action that it determines
might involve it in liability or might materially adversely affect the rights of any Noteholders
not consenting to such action.

Section 5.12.    Waiver of Past Defaults   .  The Majority Noteholders may waive any
past Default or Event of Default and its consequences, except a Default (a) in the payment of
principal of or interest on any of the Notes or (b) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof
that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each Noteholder. In the case of any such
waiver, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, and Noteholders shall be restored to their former
positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other Default or impair any right consequent thereto.

Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist and be deemed to have been cured and
not to have occurred, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured
and not to have occurred, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to
any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereto.

Section 5.13.    Undertaking for Costs   .  All parties to this Indenture agree, and
each Noteholder by such Noteholder s acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any
court may in
its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this
Indenture, or in any suit against the Indenture Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted
by it as Indenture Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay
the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs,
including reasonable attorneys  fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to
the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions
of this  Section 5.13  shall not apply to (a) any suit instituted by the Indenture Trustee,
(b) any suit instituted by any Noteholder, or group of Noteholders, in each case holding in the
aggregate Percentage Interests of the Outstanding Notes of more than 10% or (c) any suit instituted
by any Noteholder for the enforcement of the payment of principal of or interest on any Note on or
after the respective due dates expressed in such Note and in this Indenture (or, in the case of
redemption, on or after the Redemption Date).

Section 5.14.    Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws   .  The Issuer covenants (to the
extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead or in any
manner whatsoever, claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever
enacted, now or at any time

28

hereafter in force, that may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the
Issuer (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage
of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power
herein granted to the Indenture Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such
power as though no such law had been enacted.

Section 5.15.    Action on Notes   .  The Indenture Trustee s right to seek and recover
judgment on the Notes or under this Indenture shall not be affected by the seeking, obtaining or
application of any other relief under or with respect to this Indenture. Neither the lien of this
Indenture nor any rights or remedies of the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders shall be impaired
by the recovery of any judgment by the Indenture Trustee against the Issuer or by the levy of any
execution under such judgment upon any portion of the Collateral or upon any of the assets of the
Issuer. Any money or property collected by the Indenture Trustee shall be applied in accordance
with  Section 5.04(b)  hereof.

Section 5.16.    Performance and Enforcement of Certain Obligations   . 

(a) Promptly following a request from the Indenture Trustee to do so and at the
Administrator s expense, the Issuer shall take all such lawful action as the Indenture Trustee may
request to compel or secure the performance and observance by the Loan Originator and the Servicer,
as applicable, of each of their obligations to the Issuer under or in connection with the Sale and
Servicing Agreement or the Loan Purchase and Contribution Agreement, and to exercise any and all
rights, remedies, powers and privileges lawfully available to the Issuer under or in connection
with the Sale and Servicing Agreement to the extent and in the manner directed by the Indenture
Trustee, including the transmission of notices of default on the part of the Loan Originator or the
Servicer thereunder and the institution of legal or administrative actions or proceedings to compel
or secure performance by the Loan Originator or the Servicer of each of their obligations under the
Sale and Servicing Agreement and the Loan Purchase and Contribution Agreement.

(b) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Indenture Trustee
may, and at the direction (which direction shall be in writing or by telephone, confirmed in
writing promptly thereafter) of the Majority Noteholders shall, subject to  Section 5.06(c) 
exercise all rights, remedies, powers, privileges and claims of the Issuer against the Loan
Originator or the Servicer under or in connection with the Sale and Servicing Agreement or the Loan
Purchase and Contribution Agreement, including the right or power to take any action to compel or
secure performance or observance by the Loan Originator or the Servicer, as the case may be, of
each of their obligations to the Issuer thereunder and to
give any consent, request, notice, direction, approval, extension, or waiver under the Sale
and Servicing Agreement, and any right of the Issuer to take such action shall be suspended.

ARTICLE VI 

THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE 

Section 6.01.    Duties of Indenture Trustee   . 

(a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Indenture Trustee
shall exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care
and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in
the conduct of such person s own affairs.

(b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:

29

(i) the Indenture Trustee shall undertake to perform such duties and only such duties as are
specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into
this Indenture against the Indenture Trustee; and

(ii) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Indenture Trustee may conclusively rely, as to
the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon
certificates or opinions furnished to the Indenture Trustee and conforming to the requirements of
this Indenture; provided, however, that the Indenture Trustee shall examine the certificates and
opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture to the
extent specifically set forth herein.

(c) The Indenture Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own
negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:

(i) this paragraph does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this  Section 6.01 ;

(ii) the Indenture Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a
Responsible Officer unless it is proved that the Indenture Trustee was negligent in ascertaining
the pertinent facts; and

(iii) the Indenture Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to
take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it pursuant to  Section 5.11 
hereof.

(d) The Indenture Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it and held in
a Trust Account except as may be provided in the Sale and Servicing Agreement or as the Indenture
Trustee may agree in writing with the Issuer.

(e) Money held in trust by the Indenture Trustee shall be segregated from other funds except to the
extent permitted by law or the terms of this Indenture or the Sale and Servicing Agreement.

(f) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Indenture Trustee to expend or risk its own
funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or
in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds to believe that
repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably
assured to it; provided, however, that the Indenture Trustee shall not refuse or fail to perform
any of its duties hereunder solely as a result of nonpayment of its normal fees and expenses and
provided, further, that nothing in this  Section 6.01(f)  shall be construed to limit the
exercise by the Indenture Trustee of any right or remedy permitted under this Indenture or
otherwise in the event of the Issuer s failure to pay the Indenture Trustee s fees and expenses
pursuant to  Section 6.07  hereof.

(g) Every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or
affording protection to the Indenture Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this
 Section 6.01 .

(h) The Indenture Trustee shall not be required to take notice or be deemed to have notice or
knowledge of any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default pursuant to  Section 5.01(a)
or (b)  hereof) unless a Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee shall have received
written notice thereof or otherwise shall have actual knowledge thereof. In the absence of receipt
of notice or such knowledge, the Indenture Trustee may conclusively assume that there is no Event
of Default.

30

Section 6.02.    Rights of Indenture Trustee   .  (a) The Indenture Trustee may rely on any
document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper person.
The Indenture Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document.

(b) Before the Indenture Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officer s
Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel. The Indenture Trustee shall not be liable for any action it
takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on an Officer s Certificate or Opinion of Counsel.

(c) The Indenture Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties
hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys or a custodian or nominee.

(d) The Indenture Trustee shall not be liable for (i) any action it takes or omits to take in good
faith which it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers; provided, however, that
such action or omission by the Indenture Trustee does not constitute willful misconduct, negligence
or bad faith; or (ii) any action or inaction on the part of the Custodian.

(e) The Indenture Trustee may consult with counsel, and the advice or opinion of counsel with
respect to legal matters relating to this Indenture and the Notes shall be full and complete
authorization and protection from liability in respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by
it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel.

Section 6.03.    Individual Rights of Indenture Trustee   .  The Indenture Trustee in its
individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal
with the Issuer or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Indenture
Trustee. Any Paying Agent, Note Registrar, co-registrar or co-paying agent may do the same with
like rights. However, the Indenture Trustee must comply with  Section 6.11  hereof.

Section 6.04.    Indenture Trustee s Disclaimer   .  The Indenture Trustee shall not be
responsible for and makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the
Notes, shall not be accountable for the Issuer s use of the proceeds from the Notes, or responsible
for any statement of the Issuer in the Indenture or in any document issued in connection with the
sale of the Notes or in the Notes other than the Indenture Trustee s certificate of authentication.

Section 6.05.    Notices of Default   .  If a Default occurs and is continuing and if it is
actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee, the Indenture Trustee shall mail
to each Noteholder and each party to the Master Disposition Confirmation Agreement notice of the
Default within two Business Days after it receives actual notice of such occurrence.

Section 6.06.    Reports by Indenture Trustee to Holders   .  The Indenture Trustee shall deliver
to each Noteholder such information specifically requested by each Noteholder and in the Indenture
Trustee s possession and as may be reasonably required to enable such Noteholder to prepare its
federal and state income tax returns.

Section 6.07.    Compensation and Indemnity   .  As compensation for its services hereunder, the
Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to receive, on each Payment Date, the Indenture Trustee s Fee
pursuant to  Section 8.02(c)  hereof (which compensation shall not be limited by any law on
compensation of a trustee of an express trust) and shall be entitled to reimbursement by the
Servicer for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred or made by it, including costs of
collection, in addition to the compensation for its services. Such expenses shall include the
reasonable compensation and expenses, disbursements and advances of the Indenture Trustee s agents,
counsel, accountants and

31

experts. The Issuer agrees to cause the Servicer to indemnify the Indenture Trustee, the
Custodian, the Paying Agent and their officers, directors, employees and agents against any and all
loss, liability or expense (including reasonable attorneys  fees) incurred by it or them in
connection with the administration of this trust and the performance of its or their duties under
the Basic Documents. The Indenture Trustee shall notify the Issuer and the Servicer promptly of any
claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Indenture Trustee so to notify the Issuer and
the Servicer shall not relieve the Issuer or the Servicer of its or their obligations hereunder.
The Issuer shall, or shall cause the Servicer to, defend any such claim; provided, however, that if
the defendants with respect to any such claim include the Issuer and/or the Servicer and the
Indenture Trustee, and the Indenture Trustee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be
legal defenses available to it which are different from or in addition to those defenses available
to the Issuer or the Servicer, as the case may be, the Indenture Trustee shall have the right, at
the expense of the Servicer, to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to
otherwise defend itself against such claim. Neither the Issuer nor the
Servicer need reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by
the Indenture Trustee through the Indenture Trustee s own willful misconduct, negligence or bad
faith.

The Issuer s payment obligations to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this  Section 6.07 
shall survive the discharge of this Indenture and the termination or resignation of the Indenture
Trustee. When the Indenture Trustee incurs expenses after the occurrence of a Default specified in
 Section 5.01(e)  or (f) hereof with respect to the Issuer, the expenses are intended to
constitute expenses of administration under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other
applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

Notwithstanding anything in this  Section 6.07  to the contrary, all amounts due the
Indenture Trustee hereunder shall be payable in the first instance by the Servicer and, if not paid
by the Servicer within 60 days after payment is requested from the Servicer by the Indenture
Trustee, in accordance with the priorities set forth in Section 5.01 of the Sale and Servicing
Agreement.

Section 6.08.    Replacement of Indenture Trustee   .  No resignation or removal of the Indenture
Trustee and no appointment of a successor Indenture Trustee shall become effective until the
acceptance of appointment by the successor Indenture Trustee pursuant to this  Section 6.08 .
The Indenture Trustee may resign at any time by so notifying the Issuer. The Majority Noteholders
may remove the Indenture Trustee (with the consent of the Majority Certificateholders, not to be
unreasonably withheld) by so notifying the Indenture Trustee and may appoint a successor Indenture
Trustee; provided, that all of the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Indenture Trustee
in connection with such removal shall be reimbursed to it prior to the effectiveness of such
removal. The Issuer shall remove the Indenture Trustee if

(a) 
       
     the Indenture Trustee fails to comply with  Section 6.11  hereof, 

(b) 
       
     the Indenture Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent; 

(c) 
       
     a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Indenture Trustee or its property; or 

(d) 
       
     the Indenture Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting. 

If the Indenture Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Indenture
Trustee for any reason (the Indenture Trustee in such event being referred to herein as the
retiring Indenture Trustee), the Issuer shall promptly appoint a successor Indenture Trustee.

32

A successor Indenture Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the
retiring Indenture Trustee and to the Issuer. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring
Indenture Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Indenture Trustee shall have all the
rights, powers and duties of the Indenture Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Indenture
Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Noteholders. The retiring Indenture Trustee shall
promptly transfer all property held by it as Indenture Trustee to the successor Indenture Trustee.

If a successor Indenture Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Indenture
Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Indenture Trustee, the Issuer or the Majority
Noteholders may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor
Indenture Trustee.

If the Indenture Trustee fails to comply with  Section 6.11  hereof, any Noteholder may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Indenture Trustee and the
appointment of a successor Indenture Trustee.

Notwithstanding the replacement of the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this  Section 6.08 , the
Issuer s and the Administrator s obligations under  Section 6.07  hereof shall continue for
the benefit of the retiring Indenture Trustee.

Section 6.09.    Successor Indenture Trustee by Merger   .  If the Indenture Trustee consolidates
with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all its corporate trust business
or assets to, another corporation or banking association, the resulting, surviving or transferee
corporation without any further act shall be the successor Indenture Trustee; provided, however,
that such corporation or banking association shall otherwise be qualified and eligible under
 Section 6.11  hereof. The Indenture Trustee shall provide the Majority Noteholders prior
written notice of any such transaction.

In case at the time such successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation to the
Indenture Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture any of the Notes shall have
been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Indenture
Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor trustee, and deliver such
Notes so authenticated; and in case at that time any of the Notes shall not have been
authenticated, any successor to the Indenture Trustee may authenticate such Notes either in the
name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor to the Indenture Trustee; and in
all such cases such certificates shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Notes or in
this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Indenture Trustee shall have.

Section 6.10.    Appointment of Co-Indenture Trustee or Separate Indenture Trustee   . 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture, at any time, for the purpose of meeting
any legal requirement of any jurisdiction in which any part of the Collateral may at the time be
located, the Indenture Trustee shall have the power and may execute and deliver all instruments to
appoint one or more Persons to act as a co-trustee or co-trustees, or separate trustee or separate
trustees, of all or any part of the Trust, and to vest in such Person or Persons, in such capacity
and for the benefit of the Noteholders, such title to the Collateral, or any part hereof, and,
subject to the other provisions of this  Section 6.10 , such powers, duties, obligations,
rights and trusts as the Indenture Trustee may consider necessary or desirable. No co-trustee or
separate trustee hereunder shall be required to meet the terms of eligibility as a successor
trustee under  Section 6.11  hereof and no notice to Noteholders of the appointment of any
co-trustee or separate trustee shall be required under  Section 6.08  hereof.

33

(b) Every separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, be appointed
and act subject to the following provisions and conditions:

(i) all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed upon the Indenture Trustee
shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed by the Indenture Trustee and such
separate trustee or co-trustee jointly (it being understood that such separate trustee or
co-trustee is not authorized to act separately without the Indenture Trustee joining in such act),

to be performed the Indenture Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or
acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations (including the holding of title to
the Collateral or any portion thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed

trustee or co-trustee shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its

the Indenture Trustee shall mail to the Noteholders to which such amendment or supplemental
indenture relates a notice prepared by the Issuer setting forth in general terms the substance of

conditions precedent, if any, provided for in this Indenture relating to the proposed action have

Every certificate or opinion with respect to compliance with a condition or covenant provided for
in this Indenture shall include:

(1) 
       
     a statement that each signatory of such certificate or opinion has
read or has caused to be read such covenant or condition and the
definitions herein relating thereto; 

(2) 
       
     a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination or
investigation upon which the statements or opinions contained in such
certificate or opinion are based; 

(3) 
       
     a statement that, in the opinion of each such signatory, such
signatory has made such examination or investigation as is necessary
to enable such signatory to express an informed opinion as to whether
or not such covenant or condition has been complied with; and 

(4) 
       
     a statement as to whether, in the opinion of each such signatory, such
condition or covenant has been complied with. 

Section 11.02.    Form of Documents Delivered to Indenture Trustee   .  In any case where several
matters are required to be certified by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified Person, it is
not necessary that all such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such
Person,

41

or that they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one such Person may certify
or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more other such Persons as to other
matters, and any such Person may certify or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several
documents.

Any certificate or opinion of an Authorized Officer of the Issuer may be based, insofar as it
relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless
such officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or
opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which such officer s certificate or
opinion is based are erroneous. Any such certificate of an Authorized Officer or Opinion of Counsel
may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters,
upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an officer or officers of the Servicer,
the Loan Originator, the Issuer or the Administrator, stating that the information with respect to
such factual matters is in the possession of the Servicer, the Loan Originator, the Issuer or the

the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous.

Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications, requests, consents,
certificates, statements, opinions or other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need
not, be consolidated and form one instrument.

Whenever in this Indenture, in connection with any application or certificate or report to the
Indenture Trustee, it is provided that the Issuer shall deliver any document as a condition of the
granting of such application, or as evidence of the Issuer s compliance with any term hereof, it is
intended that the truth and accuracy, at the time of the granting of such application or at the
effective date of such certificate or report (as the case may be), of the facts and opinions stated
in such document shall in such case be conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer to have such
application granted or to the sufficiency of such certificate or report. The foregoing shall not,
however, be construed to affect the Indenture Trustee s right to rely upon the truth and accuracy
of any statement or opinion contained in any such document as provided in  Article VI ,
hereof.

Section 11.03.    Acts of Noteholders   .  (a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction,
notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by

tenor signed by such Noteholders in person or by agents duly appointed in writing; and except as
herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or
instruments are delivered to the Indenture Trustee, and, where it is hereby expressly required, to
the Issuer. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby)
are herein sometimes referred to as the  Act of Noteholders  signing such instrument or
instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent
shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to  Section 6.01  hereof)
conclusive in favor of the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer, if made in the manner provided in this
 Section 11.03 .

proved in any manner that the Indenture Trustee deems sufficient.

(c) The ownership of Notes shall be proved by the Note Register.

Noteholder shall bind the Holder of every Note issued upon the registration thereof or in exchange
therefor or in lieu thereof, in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the
Indenture Trustee or the Issuer in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made
upon such Note.

42

authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Noteholders or other documents provided

or the Administrator. The Issuer shall promptly transmit any notice received by it from the
Noteholders to the Indenture Trustee.

Section 11.05.    Notices to Noteholders, Waiver   .  Where this Indenture provides for notice to
Noteholders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein
expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class, postage prepaid to each Noteholder
affected by such event, at his address as it appears on the Note Register, not later than the
latest date, and not earlier than
the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to
Noteholders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice nor any defect in any notice
so mailed to any particular Noteholder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to
other Noteholders, and any notice that is mailed in the manner herein provided shall conclusively
be presumed to have duly been given.

Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by any
Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be
the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Noteholders shall be filed with the Indenture
Trustee but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in
reliance upon such a waiver.

In case, by reason of the suspension of regular mail service as a result of a strike, work stoppage
or similar activity, it shall be impractical to mail notice of any event to Noteholders when such
notice is required to be given pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, then any manner of
giving such notice as shall be satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee shall be deemed to be a
sufficient giving of such notice.

Section 11.06.    Effect of Headings and Table of Contents   .  The Article and Section headings
herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction
hereof.

Section 11.07.    Successors and Assigns   .  All covenants and agreements in this Indenture and
the Notes by the Issuer shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not. All
agreements of the Indenture Trustee in this Indenture shall bind its successors, co-trustees and
agents.

43

Section 11.08.    Separability   .  In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Notes
shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

Section 11.09.    Benefits of Indenture   .  Nothing in this Indenture or in the Notes, express or
implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors hereunder,
and the Noteholders and the Noteholder Agent, and any other party secured hereunder, and any other
Person with an ownership interest in any part of the Collateral, any benefit or any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture.

Section 11.10.    Legal Holidays   .  In any case where the date on which any payment is due shall
not be a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any other provision of the Notes or this Indenture)
payment need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the
same force and effect as if made on the date on which nominally due, and no interest shall accrue
for the period from and after any such nominal date.

Section 11.11.    GOVERNING LAW   .  THIS INDENTURE SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS (OTHER THAN SECTION
5-1401 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW), AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE
PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

Section 11.12.    Counterparts   .  This Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall
together constitute but one and the same instrument.

Section 11.13.    Recording of Indenture   .  If this Indenture is subject to recording in any
appropriate public recording offices, such recording is to be effected by the Issuer and at its
expense accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel (which may be counsel to the Indenture Trustee or any
other counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indenture Trustee; provided, however, that the expense
of such Opinion of Counsel shall in no event be an expense of the Indenture Trustee) to the effect
that such recording is necessary either for the protection of the Noteholders or any other Person
secured hereunder or for the enforcement of any right or remedy granted to the Indenture Trustee
under this Indenture.

Section 11.14.    Trust Obligation   .  No recourse may be taken, directly or indirectly, with
respect to the obligations of the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee on the Notes
or, except as expressly provided for in  Article VI  hereof, under this Indenture or
any certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith or therewith, against (i) the
Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, (ii) any owner of a beneficial
interest in the Issuer or (iii) any partner, owner, beneficiary, agent, officer, director,
employee, agent or  control person  within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act,
of the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, any holder of a
beneficial interest in the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee or of any successor
or assign of the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, except as any
such Person may expressly have agreed (it being understood that the Indenture Trustee and the Owner
Trustee have no such obligations in their individual capacity) and except that any such partner,
owner or beneficiary of the Issuer shall be fully liable, to the extent provided by applicable law,
for any unpaid consideration for stock, unpaid capital contribution or failure to pay any
installment or call owing to such entity. For all purposes of this Indenture, in the performance of
any duties or obligations of the Issuer hereunder, the Owner Trustee shall be subject to, and
entitled to the benefits of, the terms and provisions of Articles VI, VII and VIII of the Trust
Agreement.

44

Section 11.15.    No Petition   .  The Indenture Trustee, by entering into this Indenture,
and each Noteholder, by accepting a Note, hereby covenant and agree that they will not at any time
institute against the Depositor or the Issuer, or join in any institution against the Depositor or
the Issuer of, any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings,
or other proceedings under any United States federal or state bankruptcy or similar law, in
connection with any obligations relating to the Notes, this Indenture or any of the Basic
Documents.

Section 11.16.    Inspection   .  The Issuer agrees that, on reasonable prior notice, it will
permit any representative of the Indenture Trustee, during the Issuer s normal business hours, to
examine all the books of account, records, reports and other papers of the Issuer, to make copies
and extracts therefrom, to cause such books to be audited by Independent certified public
accountants, and to discuss the Issuer s affairs, finances and accounts with the Issuer s officers,
employees, and Independent certified public accountants, all at such reasonable times and as often
as may reasonably be requested and at the expense of the Servicer. The Indenture Trustee shall and
shall cause its representatives to hold in confidence all such information except to the extent
disclosure may be required by law (and all reasonable applications for confidential treatment are
unavailing) and except to the extent that the Indenture Trustee may reasonably determine that such
disclosure is consistent with its obligations hereunder.

Section 11.17.    Third Party Beneficiary   .  The Noteholders and the Noteholder Agent are
intended third party beneficiaries of this Indenture and shall be entitled to rely upon and
directly enforce the provisions of this Indenture as if parties hereto.

Section 11.18.    Limitation on Liability   .  It is expressly understood and agreed by the
parties hereto that (a) this Indenture is executed and delivered by Wilmington Trust Company, not
individually or personally, but solely as Owner Trustee of Option One Owner Trust 2005-9, in the
exercise of the powers and authority conferred and vested in it, (b) each of the representations,
undertakings and agreements herein made on the part of the Issuer is made and intended not as

perform any covenant either expressed or implied contained herein, all such liability, if any,
being expressly waived by the parties hereto and by any Person claiming by, through or under the
parties hereto and (d) under no circumstances shall Wilmington Trust Company be personally liable
for the payment of any indebtedness or expenses of the Issuer or be liable for the breach or

OPTION ONE OWNER TRUST 2005-9, a Delaware statutory trust (the   Issuer  ), for value
received, hereby promises to pay to                                             , or registered assigns (the
  Noteholder  ), the principal sum of                                              ($                      ) or so much
thereof as may be advanced and outstanding hereunder and to pay interest on such principal sum or
such part thereof as shall remain unpaid from time to time, at the rate and at the times provided
in the Sale and Servicing Agreement and the Indenture. Principal of this Note is payable on each
Payment Date in an amount equal to the result obtained by multiplying (i) the Percentage Interest
of this Note by (ii) the principal amount distributed in respect of such Payment Date.

The Outstanding Note Principal Balance of this Note bears interest at the Note Interest Rate. On
each Payment Date amounts in respect of interest on this Note will be paid in an amount equal to
the result obtained by multiplying (i) the Percentage Interest of this Note by (ii) the aggregate
amount paid in respect of interest on the Notes with respect to such Payment Date.

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Indenture (the
  Indenture  ), dated as of December 30, 2005, between the Issuer and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,
as Indenture Trustee (the   Indenture Trustee  ) or, if not defined therein, the Sale and
Servicing Agreement (the   Sale and Servicing Agreement  ), dated as of December 30, 2005,
among the Issuer, the Depositor, the Servicer, the Loan Originator and the Indenture Trustee on
behalf of the Noteholders.

By its acceptance of this Note, each Noteholder covenants and agrees, until the earlier of (a) the
termination of the Revolving Period and (b) the Maturity Date, on each Transfer Date to advance
amounts in respect of Additional Note Principal Balance hereunder to the Issuer, subject to and in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Sale and Servicing Agreement and the Note Purchase
Agreement.

In the event of an advance of Additional Note Principal Balance by the Noteholders as provided in
 Section 2.01(c)  of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, each Noteholder shall, and is hereby
authorized to, record on the schedule attached to its Note the date and amount of any Additional
Note Principal Balance advanced by it, and each repayment thereof; provided that failure to make
any such recordation on such schedule or any error in such schedule shall not adversely affect any
Noteholder s rights with respect to its Additional Note Principal Balance and its right to receive
interest payments in respect of the Additional Note Principal Balance held by such Noteholder.

Absent manifest error, the Note Principal Balance of each Note as set forth in the notations made
by the related Noteholder on such Note shall be binding upon the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer;
provided that failure by a Noteholder to make such recordation on its Note or any error in such
notation shall not adversely affect any Noteholder s rights with respect to its Note Principal
Balance and its right to receive principal and interest payments in respect thereof.

The Servicer may, at its option, effect an early redemption of the Notes for an amount equal to the
Note Redemption Amount on any Payment Date on or after the Clean-up Call Date. The

Servicer shall effect such early termination by providing notice thereof to the Indenture
Trustee and Owner Trustee and by purchasing all of the Loans at a purchase price, payable in cash,
equal to the Termination Price.

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof,
which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

The statements in the legend set forth above are an integral part of the terms of this Note and by
acceptance hereof each Holder of this Note agrees to be subject to and bound by the terms and
provisions set forth in such legend.

Unless the Certificate of authentication hereon shall have been executed by an authorized officer
of the Indenture Trustee, by manual signature, this Note shall not entitle the Noteholder hereof to
any benefit under the Indenture or the Sale and Servicing Agreement and/or be valid for any
purpose.

THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE AND PERFORMED WITHIN THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT
TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS THEREOF (OTHER THAN SECTION 5-1401 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL

Reverse of Note 

This Note is one of the duly authorized Notes of the Issuer, designated as its Mortgage-Backed
Notes (herein called the   Notes  ), all issued under the Indenture. Reference is hereby made
to the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto, and the Sale and Servicing Agreement for
a statement of the respective rights and obligations thereunder of the Issuer, the Indenture
Trustee and the Noteholders. To the extent that any provision of this Note contradicts or is
inconsistent with the provisions of the Indenture or the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the
provisions of the Indenture or the Sale and Servicing Agreement, as applicable, shall control and
supersede such contradictory or inconsistent provision herein. The Notes are subject to all terms
of the Indenture and the Sale and Servicing Agreement.

The principal of and interest on this Note are payable in such coin or currency of the United
States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private
debts. All payments made by the Issuer with respect to this Note shall be applied in accordance
with the Indenture and the Sale and Servicing Agreement.

The entire unpaid principal amount of this Note shall be due and payable on the earlier of the
Maturity Date, the Redemption Date and the Final Put Date, if any, pursuant to  Article X  of
the Sale and Servicing Agreement and the Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the entire
unpaid principal amount of the Notes shall be due and payable on the date on which an Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Indenture Trustee, at the direction or upon
the prior written consent of the Majority Noteholders, has declared the Notes to be immediately due
and payable in the manner provided in  Section 5.02  of the Indenture. All principal payments
on the Notes shall be made  pro rata  to the Noteholders entitled thereto.

The Collateral secures this Note and all other Notes equally and ratably without prejudice,
priority or distinction between any Note and any other Note. The Notes are non-recourse obligations
of the Issuer and are limited in right of payment to amounts available from the Collateral, as
provided in the Indenture. The Issuer shall not otherwise be liable for payments on the Notes, and
none of the owners, agents, officers, directors, employees, or successors or assigns of the Issuer
shall be personally liable for any amounts payable, or performance due, under the Notes or the
Indenture.

Any installment of interest or principal on this Note shall be paid on the applicable Payment Date
to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) is registered in the Note
Register as of the close of business on the related Record Date by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to the account specified in writing by the related Noteholder to the extent
provided by the Indenture and otherwise by check mailed to the Noteholder.

Any reduction in the principal amount of this Note (or any one or more Predecessor Notes) effected
by any payments made on any Payment Date shall be binding upon all future Holders of this Note and
of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu
hereof, whether or not noted hereon. Any increase in the principal amount of this Note (or any one
or more Predecessor Notes) effected by payments to the Issuer of Additional Note Principal Balances
shall be binding upon the Issuer and shall inure to the benefit of all future Holders of this Note
and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu
hereof, whether or not noted hereon.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth therein, the transfer of
this Note may be registered on the Note Register upon surrender of this Note for registration of
transfer at the office or agency designated by the Issuer pursuant to the Indenture, duly endorsed
by, or

A-5

accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in the form attached hereto duly executed by,
the Holder hereof or such Holder s attorney duly authorized in writing, with such signature
guaranteed by an  eligible guarantor institution  meeting the requirements of the Securities
Transfer Agent s Medallion Program ( STAMP ), and thereupon one or more new Notes of authorized
denominations and in the same aggregate principal amount will be issued to the designated
transferee or transferees. No service charge will be charged for any registration of transfer or
exchange of this Note, but the Issuer may require the Noteholder to pay a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any such registration
of transfer or exchange.

Each Noteholder, by acceptance of a Note or a beneficial interest in a Note, covenants and agrees
that no recourse may be taken, directly or indirectly, with respect to the obligations of the
Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee on the Notes or under the Indenture or any
certificate or other writing delivered in connection therewith, against (i) the Indenture Trustee
or the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, (ii) any owner of a beneficial interest in the
Issuer or (iii) any partner, owner, beneficiary, agent, officer, director, employee or  control
person  within the meaning of the 1933 Act and the Exchange Act of the Indenture Trustee or the
Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, any holder of a beneficial interest in the Issuer, the
Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee or of any successor or assign of the Indenture Trustee or
the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, except as any such Person may have expressly agreed
and except that any such partner, owner or beneficiary shall be fully liable, to the extent
provided by applicable law, for any unpaid consideration for stock, unpaid capital contribution or
failure to pay any installment or call owing to such entity.

Each Noteholder, by acceptance of a Note or a beneficial interest in a Note, covenants and agrees
by accepting the benefits of the Indenture that such Noteholder will not at any time institute
against the Issuer, or join in any institution against the Issuer of, any bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under any United States federal
or state bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations relating to the Notes or the
Basic Documents.

The Issuer has entered into the Indenture and this Note is issued with the intention that, for
federal, state and local income, single business and franchise tax purposes, the Notes will qualify
as indebtedness of the Issuer secured by the Collateral. Each Noteholder, by acceptance of a Note,
agrees to treat the Notes for federal, state and local income, single business and franchise tax
purposes as indebtedness of the Issuer. Each Noteholder, by its acceptance of a Note, represents
and warrants that the number of ICA Owners with respect to all of its Notes shall not exceed four.

Prior to the due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note, the Issuer, the Indenture
Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee may treat the Person in whose name
this Note (as of the day of determination or as of such other date as may be specified in the
Indenture) is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue,
and none of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or any such agent shall be affected by notice to the
contrary.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the
modification of the rights and obligations of the Issuer and the rights of the Noteholders under
the Indenture at any time by the Issuer with the consent of the Majority Noteholders. The Indenture
also contains provisions permitting the Holders of Notes representing specified Percentage
Interests of the Outstanding Notes, on behalf of all of the Noteholders, to waive compliance by the
Issuer with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and
their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note (or any one or more
Predecessor Notes) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of
this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or
in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. The
Indenture also permits the Indenture Trustee to

A-6

amend or waive certain terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture without the consent of
any Noteholder.

The term  Issuer  as used in this Note includes any successor to the Issuer under the
Indenture.

The Notes are issuable only in registered form in denominations as provided in the Indenture,
subject to certain limitations therein set forth.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall
alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the
principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency
herein prescribed.

Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, except as expressly provided in the Basic
Documents, none of the Issuer in its individual capacity, the Owner Trustee in its individual
capacity, any owner of a beneficial interest in the Issuer, or any of their respective partners,
beneficiaries, agents, officers, directors, employees or successors or assigns shall be personally
liable for, nor shall recourse be had to any of them for, the payment of principal of or interest
on this Note or performance of, or omission to perform, any of the covenants, obligations or
indemnifications contained in the Indenture. The Holder of this Note by its acceptance hereof
agrees that, except as expressly provided in the Basic Documents, in the case of an Event of
Default under the Indenture, the Holder shall have no claim against any of the foregoing for any
deficiency, loss or claim therefrom; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be
taken to prevent recourse to, and enforcement against, the assets of the Issuer for any and all
liabilities, obligations and undertakings contained in the Indenture or in this Note.
