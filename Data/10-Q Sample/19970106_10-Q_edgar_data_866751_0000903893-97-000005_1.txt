                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION

         The accompanying  unaudited consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim
financial  information and with the  instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of
Regulation  S-X.  Accordingly,  they do not include all of the  information  and
notes  required  by  generally  accepted  accounting   principles  for  complete
consolidated financial statements.

         In the opinion of management,  all  adjustments  (consisting  solely of
normal recurring  adjustments)  considered necessary for a fair statement of the
interim financial data have been included. Results from operations for the three
and nine month periods ended November 22, 1996 are not necessarily indicative of
the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending February 28, 1997.

shares  outstanding during the period including dilutive employee stock options,
underwriter warrants, Class A and B warrants, using the treasury stock method as
applicable, and Series A and B Preferred Stock. Common stock equivalents are not
reflected  in  the   calculation   in  periods  in  which  they  would  have  an
anti-dilutive effect.

NOTE 5: NOTE PAYABLE -BANK

         The Company has a $4,000,000 revolving line of credit from a commercial
bank that is secured by accounts receivable and inventory.  Borrowings under the
line of credit are subject to 80% of qualifying  accounts  receivable and 35% of
qualifying inventories (up to a maximum inventory loan of $1,500,000),  less the
aggregate amount utilized under all commercial and standby letters of credit and
bank  acceptances.  The line of credit  bears  interest at the bank's prime rate
plus 2.5% (10.75% at November 22,  1996),  and provides for a 1/8th of 1% unused
line fee and is subject to renewal annually. At November 22, 1996,  availability
under the line of credit was  approximately  $330,000 and the balance  under the
line of credit was $3,724,612.

         Terms of an amendment dated March 1, 1996,  include  certain  financial
covenants  that the Company must  maintain,  including  debt  service  coverage,
capital  base,  and debt to equity  covenants.  The Company is in  violation  of
several of the covenants as of November 22, 1996.

         On December 5, 1996 the Company refinanced its bank line of credit with
a new lending institution (See Note 8-Subsequent Event).

NOTE 7: RC AMERICA, INC.

         On May 15, 1996, the Company issued 2,550 shares to Ronald Caulfield as
part of the February 26, 1994  agreement  providing for the issuance of up to an
additional  100,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock over a five year period
based on RC America,  Inc.  attaining  certain levels of pre-tax  earnings.  The
Agreement  also  contains  demand  and  piggy-back  registration  rights for the
shares.

NOTE 8: SUBSEQUENT EVENT

         On December 5, 1996 the Company refinanced its bank line of credit with
a new  lending  institution.  The new  revolving  line of credit  is  $8,000,000
secured by accounts  receivable  and  inventory  and all other assets except for
equipment.  Availability of borrowings under the line of credit is determined by
calculations  of the  borrowing  base, as  specifically  defined in the loan and
security  agreement,  but generally means 85% of qualifying  accounts receivable
and 40% of eligible  inventories  less the aggregate  amount of all  outstanding
commercial and standby  letters of credit.  The line of credit bears interest at
1.5% above the variable interest rate quoted by Norwest Bank of Minnesota with a
minimum  rate of 8.0%.  The credit line is for 5 years and is subject to renewal
annually.  The line of credit  includes  certain  financial  covenants  that the
Company  must  maintain  to avoid a default  including  current  ratio,  debt to
equity, maintaining a net worth of $14 million and profitability.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS OR INFORMATION

         Certain  statements  contained  in this  Form  10-Q  are not  based  on
historical facts, but are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the
Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that are based upon a number
of assumptions  concerning  future  conditions  that may ultimately  prove to be
inaccurate.  Actual events and results may  materially  differ from  anticipated
results described in such statements.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

         THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 1997 COMPARED TO THIRD QUARTER
         OF FISCAL YEAR 1996

         For the third  quarter of Fiscal 1997,  ended  November  22, 1996,  the
Company had sales totaling $8,840,916 as compared to sales of $8,073,432 for the
third quarter of Fiscal 1996, ended November 24, 1995, an increase of 9.5%.

         The Company's core bag and film business  (traditional  plastic grocery
carryout bags and proprietary plastic carryout bags of "T-shirt sack" design and
plastic film  products)  had sales of  $8,761,116 in the third quarter of Fiscal
1997  compared to $7,542,638 in the third quarter of Fiscal 1996, an increase of
16.1%.

         Sales of the Company's  proprietary bag products  (FRESH-SAC(R) T-shirt
sack produce bag,  HANDI-SACTM  and  MAXI-SACTM)  and plastic film products were
$3,228,335  in the third  quarter of Fiscal 1997 compared to sales of $2,456,357
in the third  quarter of Fiscal 1996, an increase of 31.4%.  Management  expects
that sales of  proprietary  bag products will continue to increase in the fourth
quarter of Fiscal 1997.  Sales of  traditional  products were  $5,532,781 in the
third  quarter  of Fiscal  1997  compared  to sales of  $5,086,281  in the third
quarter of Fiscal 1996,  an increase of 8.8%.  Sales from RC America,  Inc. were
$79,800 in the third quarter of Fiscal 1997 compared to sales of $502,045 in the
third  quarter  of  Fiscal  1996.   RC  America,   Inc.'s  sales  may  fluctuate
significantly  from quarter to quarter due to the nature of its business and the
timing of transactions.  BPI Packaging,  Inc. did not have any sales of products
purchased from Integrated  Bagging  Systems  Corporation in the third quarter of
Fiscal  1997  compared  to sales of $28,749 in the third  quarter of Fiscal 1996
because resources were not allocated to this subsidiary.  Market Media, Inc. did
not have revenue during the third quarter of Fiscal 1997 primarily  because of a
delay  in  receiving  necessary   independent  third  party  research  data  for
advertised brands. The research data, received in the fourth quarter,  documents
sales  increases of up to 29.9% over a 12-week  period for brands  advertised on
the Floor Focus Ad-TileTM.

         Cost of goods sold for the third quarter of Fiscal 1997 was  $7,365,285
compared to $6,974,544  in the third quarter of Fiscal 1996.  Cost of goods sold
as a percentage of sales was 83.3% for the third quarter of Fiscal 1997 compared
to 86.3% for the third  quarter of Fiscal  1996.  The  decrease in cost of goods
sold as a  percentage  of sales was due  primarily  to  increased  manufacturing
output which  lowered unit cost and an increased  proprietary  product mix which

9

has a lower cost of goods as a percentage of the selling  price  compared to the
traditional grocery carryout bag.

         Selling,  general and  administrative  expense for the third quarter of
Fiscal 1997 was $1,870,519 compared to $1,581,842 in the third quarter of Fiscal
1996.  The increase is primarily  related to  increased  shipments  (freight and
related  expenses  are  included  in SG&A),  sales and  marketing  activity  for
proprietary  bag and  film  products  and  in-store  advertising  and  promotion
products, as well as start-up costs for Market Media, Inc.

         Interest  expense  for the third  quarter of Fiscal  1997 was  $258,364
compared to  $208,624  for the third  quarter of Fiscal  1996.  The  increase is
related to debt incurred for purchases of equipment and higher rates of interest
on the credit line in Fiscal 1997 compared to Fiscal 1996.

         Net loss was $651,391 for the third  quarter of Fiscal 1997 compared to
net loss of $673,806 for the third quarter of Fiscal 1996. (The non-cash expense
of  depreciation  and  amortization  was $859,406 in the third quarter of Fiscal
1997 compared to $618,663 in the third quarter of Fiscal 1996.)

         Operating  profits  (loss) for the  various  business  segments  are as
follows:

         For the first nine months of Fiscal 1997,  ended November 22, 1996, the
Company had sales totaling  $24,670,990 as compared to sales of $21,942,420  for
the first nine months ended November 24, 1995, an increase of 12.4%.

plastic film  products)  had sales of

10

$22,730,048  for the  first  nine  months of Fiscal  1997  compared  to sales of

         Sales of the Company's  proprietary bag products  (FRESH-SAC(R) T-shirt
sack produce bag, HANDI-SAC(TM) and MAXI-SAC(TM)) and plastic film products were
$8,762,324  in the  first  nine  months  of  Fiscal  1997  compared  to sales of
$7,146,125 in the first nine months of Fiscal, 1996, an increase of 22.6%. Sales
of traditional  grocery  carryout T-shirt bags increased from $13,194,963 in the
first nine  months of Fiscal  1996 to  $13,967,724  in the first nine  months of
Fiscal  1997,  an increase of 5.8%.  RC America,  Inc.  sales for the first nine
months of Fiscal 1997 were  $1,882,423  compared to $1,197,205 in the first nine
months of Fiscal 1996. RC America, Inc.'s sales may fluctuate significantly from
quarter to quarter due to the nature of its business.  BPI  Packaging,  Inc. did
not  have  any  sales of  product  purchased  from  Integrated  Bagging  Systems
Corporation  in the  first  nine  months  of Fiscal  1997  compared  to sales of
$404,127  in the first nine  months of Fiscal 1996  because  resources  were not
allocated to this  subsidiary.  Market Media,  Inc.  recorded revenue of $58,519
during the first nine months of Fiscal 1997 which  represented  revenue from the
initial installation of Floor Focus Ad-TileTM in 104 supermarkets in May, 1996.

         Cost of  goods  sold for the  first  nine  months  of  Fiscal  1997 was
$21,665,509  compared to $17,878,560 in the previous year. Cost of goods sold as
a  percentage  of sales  was 87.8% for the  first  nine  months of Fiscal  1997,
compared to 81.4% for the first nine months of Fiscal 1996. The increase in cost
of goods sold as a  percentage  of sales was due  primarily  to an  increase  in
material costs  relative to the selling  prices of the Company's  products which
occurred   primarily  in  the  first  six  months  of  Fiscal  1997.   Increased
manufacturing  productivity and increased  proprietary product mix decreased the
cost of goods as a percentage of sales in the third quarter.

         Several factors that materially  contributed to the increase in cost of
goods sold as a percentage of sales in the first six months were the following:

         One factor that  contributed to lower margins was the impact of a major
program  cancellation  in Fiscal  1996.  In the third  quarter of Fiscal 1996, a
proprietary  bag program to which the Company had allocated more than 25% of its
manufacturing  capacity was canceled by a major retail  chain,  and the negative
impact of this cancellation continued through the second quarter of Fiscal 1997.
The manufacturing  capacity  released by the program  cancellation was partially
replaced with lower margin  traditional  grocery T-shirt sacks which have higher
material costs  compared to proprietary  products as a percentage of the selling
price.  A decline in margin for the  traditional  grocery  T-shirt sack,  caused
primarily by market  conditions and competition  for new accounts,  in the first
six  months of Fiscal  1997  compared  to the  first six  months of Fiscal  1996
reduced the gross  margin  approximately  $800,000  and caused the cost of goods
sold as a percentage of sales to increase.

         A second  factor was that  manufacturing  productivity  declined in the
first six months of Fiscal 1997 and  materially  contributed  to the increase in
cost of goods sold as a percentage  of sales.  In the first six months of Fiscal
1997,  unit production was less than unit sales resulting in lost value added of
approximately  $300,000.  The negative  impact of  under-production  resulted in
manufacturing  cost that would  otherwise  have been  absorbed in  inventory  or
additional  sales  being  expensed  in  the  first  six  months.   Manufacturing
productivity  was  negatively  impacted by several  factors:  Low backlog at the
beginning  of the fiscal  year,  unfavorable  product mix with 

11

traditional  bag products at 60% and proprietary bag products at 28% of the core
bag  and  film  business,   disruption  to  routine  production  caused  by  the
installation of a new advanced  technology  printing press and bag manufacturing
machines,  and a successful crash research and development effort to manufacture
a proprietary film product for the building products industry.

         A third factor is product mix which materially impacts actual capacity,
capacity  utilization  and  potential  revenues  from the  facility.  Management
believes  that actual plant  capacity and  potential  revenues from the facility
will expand  significantly  up to the $60-$70  million  range if  management  is
successful  in its plans to shift product mix entirely to  proprietary  bags and
plastic  films from lower margin  traditional  standard  T-shirt  sack bags.  In
particular,  most of the capital  equipment needed for these proprietary bag and
film sales is in place and only  relatively  minor  additions are needed to meet
anticipated  demand  over the near term for these  non-traditional  bag and film
products.  Management's goal is to seek to significantly  increase revenues from
the  existing  facility  through the sale of  proprietary  bag and plastic  film
products,  which  typically have higher  margins  compared to utilizing the same
production capacity for traditional T-shirt bags.

         Selling,  general and administrative  expense for the first nine months
of Fiscal 1997 was  $5,553,788  or 22.5% of sales,  compared to  $4,353,641,  or
19.8% of sales  for the  first  nine  months of Fiscal  1996.  The  increase  is
primarily  related to  increased  shipments  (freight  and related  expenses are
included in SG&A),  sales and marketing  activity for  proprietary  bag and film
products and in-store  advertising and promotion  products,  as well as start-up
costs for Market Media, Inc.

         Interest  expense for the first nine months of Fiscal 1997 was $826,331
compared  to  $516,575  for the first  nine  months of the  previous  year.  The
increase is related to debt incurred for purchases of equipment and higher rates
of interest on the credit line in Fiscal 1997 compared to Fiscal 1996.

         A net loss of  $3,369,426  for the first  nine  months  of Fiscal  1997
compared to a net loss of $770,996 for the first nine months of Fiscal 1996. The
increase in net loss was caused  primarily by  increased  cost of goods sold and
increased selling, general and administrative expenses. (The non-cash expense of
depreciation  was $2,506,266 in the first nine months of Fiscal 1997 compared to
$1,820,156 in the first nine months of Fiscal 1996.)

         Operating  profits  (loss) for the  various  business  segments  are as

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         BANK LOANS

         The  Company  has a  $4,000,000  revolving  line of credit  secured  by
accounts  receivable  and  inventory.  Borrowings  under the line of credit  are
subject  to  80%  of  qualifying  accounts  receivable  and  35%  of  qualifying
inventories up to a maximum  inventory  loan of  $1,500,000,  less the aggregate
amount  utilized  under all  commercial  and standby  letters of credit and bank
acceptances.  The line of credit  bears  interest at the bank's  prime rate plus
2.5% (10.75% at November 22,  1996),  and provides for a 1/8th of 1% unused line
fee and is subject to renewal annually. At November 22, 1996, availability under
the line of credit was approximately  $330,000 and the balance under the line of
credit was $3,724,612.

         Terms of an amendment dated March 1, 1996,  include  certain  financial
covenants  that the Company must  maintain,  including  debt  service  coverage,
capital  base,  and debt to equity  covenants.  The Company was in  violation of
several of the covenants as of November 22, 1996.

        On December 5, 1996 the Company refinanced its bank line of credit with
a new  lending  institution.  The new  revolving  line of credit  is  $8,000,000
secured by accounts  receivable  and  inventory  and all other assets except for
equipment.  Availability of borrowings under the line of credit is determined by
calculations  of the  borrowing  base, as  specifically  defined in the loan and
security  agreement,  but generally means 85% of qualifying  accounts receivable
and 40% of eligible  inventories  less the aggregate  amount of all  outstanding
commercial and standby  letters of credit.  The line of credit bears interest at
1.5% above the variable interest rate quoted by Norwest Bank of Minnesota with a
minimum  rate of 8.0%.  The credit line is for 5 years and is subject to renewal
annually.  The line of credit  includes  certain  financial  covenants  that the
Company  must  maintain  to avoid a default  including  current  ratio,  debt to
equity, maintaining a net worth of $14 million and profitability.

         SALES OF SECURITIES

         During the first  nine  months of Fiscal  1997,  the  Company  received
additional  equity funding  through the sale of Common Stock from a Regulation S
and a  Regulation  D offering,  the  exercise of  underwriters  warrants and the
exercise of Class B warrants  from the  Company's  third  public  offering.  The
Company  received  net proceeds of  $4,384,835  from the sale of an aggregate of
2,121,861 shares of Common Stock and 100,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock.
The proceeds were used to purchase  equipment and for general corporate purposes
and the  reduction  of bank debt.  The  Company may raise  additional  financing
through  the sale of  equity  or debt  securities  to pay for all or part of the
planned $2.0  million  increase in capacity at the Dighton  facility  during the
next six months as well as to increase general working capital.  The Company

13

has no  commitments  for such  financing,  and no  assurance  can be given  that
additional financing will be successfully  completed or that such financing will
be available or, if available, will be on terms favorable to the Company.

         EQUIPMENT AND LEASE FINANCING

         From March 1994 through  November  1996, the Company  acquired  through
purchase  or lease  approximately  $19.7  million  in  additional  equipment  to
increase  manufacturing  capacity  and  efficiency  and to expand the  Company's
product line. The equipment was financed from the sale of equity  securities and
from equipment lease financing and bank loans.

         The  Company  currently  has no  outstanding  commitments  to  purchase
additional  equipment.  Management  intends  to  finance  any new  purchases  of
equipment primarily through equipment lease financing. No assurance can be given
that the Company will be able to obtain new equipment financing through banks or
equipment lessors.

         CASH FLOW

         For the nine months ended November 22, 1996, net cash used by operating
activities  totaled $923,582 due to a net loss of $3,369,426 and $1,484,365 used
to finance an increase  in accounts  receivable  which was  partially  offset by
$2,506,266 from depreciation and amortization and $1,833,047 from an increase in
accounts payable.  The Company also received net proceeds of $4,384,835 from the
sale of an aggregate of 2,121,861  shares of Common Stock and 100,000  shares of
Series A Preferred  Stock.  $1,136,196  was used to purchase  equipment  and for
plant  improvements,  $1,436,429 was used to make principal  payments on capital
lease  obligations  and $27,992 to reduce the bank note.  At November  22, 1996,
stockholders'  equity was $20,789,480 as compared to $23,508,120 at November 24,
1995. The Company's  current ratio decreased from 1.13:1 at November 24, 1995 to
0.82:1 at  November  22,  1996.  The net book value of  property  and  equipment
increased  from  $22,485,845 at November 24, 1995 to $23,685,951 at November 22,
1996.

         To  date,   the  Company  has  generated   cash  flows  from  financing
activities,  including  sales of equity  securities  and bank  lines of  credit.
Management  believes  that fixed asset or lease  financing  is now  available at
competitive rates from institutional lenders and leasing companies.  The Company
may raise additional financing through the sale of equity or debt to fund all or
part of the planned  $2.0 million  increase in capacity at the Dighton  facility
during the next six months as well as to increase general working  capital.  The
Company has no  commitments  for such  financing,  and no assurance can be given
that additional financings will be successfully completed or that such financing
will be available or, if available, will be on terms favorable to the Company.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

         Inflation  during the last three fiscal years has not had a significant
effect on the Company's activities.

     2. LOAN AND TERMS OF PAYMENT.

         2.1 REVOLVING ADVANCES.

              (a)  Subject  to the  terms  and  conditions  of  this  Agreement,
Foothill  agrees  to  make  advances  ("Advances")  to  Borrower  in  an  amount
outstanding  not to  exceed  at any one  time  the  lesser  of (i)  the  Maximum
Revolving  Amount less the  outstanding  balance of all undrawn or  unreimbursed
Letters of Credit,  or (ii) the Borrowing Base less (A) the aggregate  amount of
all undrawn or unreimbursed  Letters of Credit.  For purposes of this Agreement,
"Borrowing Base", as of any date of determination, shall mean the result of:

                 (x)  the  lesser  of (i) 85% of  Eligible  Accounts,  less  the
         amount,  if any, of the  Dilution  Reserve,  or (ii) an amount equal to
         Borrower's  Collections  with respect to Accounts  for the  immediately
         preceeding forty-five (45) day period, plus

                 (y) the  lowest  of (i)  $4,000,000,  (ii) 40% of the  value of
         Eligible Inventory, and (iii) 150% of the amount of credit availability
         created by clause (x) above, minus

                 (z) the aggregate  amount of reserves,  if any,  established by
         Foothill under Section 2.1(b).

              (b)  Anything to the  contrary  in Section  2.1(a)  above  notwith
standing, Foothill may create reserves against or reduce its advance rates based
upon  Eligible  Accounts or Eligible  Inventory  without  declaring  an Event of
Default if it determines that there has occurred a Material Adverse Change.

              (c) Foothill  shall have no obligation to make Advances  hereunder
to the extent they would cause the outstanding Obligations to exceed the Maximum
Revolving Amount.

              (d) Amounts  borrowed  pursuant to this  Section 2.1 may be repaid
and,  subject to the terms and conditions of this  Agreement,  reborrowed at any
time during the term of this Agreement.

16

2.2 LETTERS OF CREDIT.
                         
              (a)  Subject  to the  terms  and  conditions  of  this  Agreement,
Foothill agrees to issue letters of credit for the account of Borrower (each, an
"L/C") or to issue guarantees of payment (each such guaranty, an "L/C Guaranty")
with  respect to letters of credit  issued by an issuing bank for the account of
Borrower.  Foothill  shall have no obligation to issue a Letter of Credit if any
of the following would result:

                 (i) the aggregate amount of all Letters of Credit, would exceed
         the  Borrowing  Base less the amount of  outstanding  Advances less the
         amount of reserves established under Section 2.1(b); or

                 (ii)  the  aggregate  amount  of all  undrawn  or  unreimbursed
         Letters of Credit would exceed the lower of: (x) the Maximum  Revolving
         Amount  less the  amount of  outstanding  Advances  less the  amount of
         reserves established under Section 2.1(b); or (y) $500,000.

Borrower expressly understands and agrees that Foothill shall have no obligation
to arrange for the  issuance by issuing  banks of the letters of credit that are
to be the subject of L/C Guarantees. Borrower and Foothill acknowledge and agree
that  certain  of the  letters  of  credit  that  are to be the  subject  of L/C
Guarantees may be  outstanding on the Closing Date.  Each Letter of Credit shall
have an  expiry  date no later  than 60 days  prior  to the  date on which  this
Agreement is scheduled to  terminate  under  Section 3.4 (without  regard to any
potential  renewal  term) and all such  Letters  of Credit  shall be in form and
substance  acceptable  to  Foothill  in its  sole  discretion.  If  Foothill  is
obligated to advance funds under a Letter of Credit,  Borrower immediately shall
reimburse such amount to Foothill and, in the absence of such reimbursement, the
amount  so  advanced  immediately  and  automatically  shall be  deemed to be an
Advance  hereunder  and,  thereafter,  shall  bear  interest  at the  rate  then
applicable to Advances under Section 2.6.

              (b) Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify,  save,  defend,  and hold
Foothill harmless from any loss, cost, expense, or liability, including payments
made by Foothill,  expenses,  and reasonable attorneys fees incurred by Foothill
arising out of or in connection with any Letter of Credit. Borrower agrees to be
bound by the issuing bank's  regulations and  interpretations  of any Letters of
Credit  guarantied  by Foothill  and opened to or for  Borrower's  account or by
Foothill's  interpretations  of any L/C issued by Foothill to or for  Borrower's
account,  even though this  interpretation may be different from Borrower's own,
and Borrower  understands  and agrees that Foothill  shall not be liable for any
error, negligence,  or mistake, whether of omission or commission,  in following
Borrower's  instructions  or those  contained  in the  Letter  of  Credit or any
modifications, amendments, or supplements thereto. Borrower understands that the
L/C  Guarantees  may require  Foothill to indemnify the issuing bank for certain
costs or  liabilities  arising out of claims by Borrower

17

against such issuing bank.  Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify,  save,  defend,
and hold Foothill  harmless with respect to any loss, cost,  expense  (including
reasonable  attorneys  fees),  or liability  incurred by Foothill  under any L/C
Guaranty as a result of  Foothill's  indemnification  of any such issuing  bank,
other than as a result of Foothill's intentional misconduct or gross negligence.

              (c) Borrower hereby  authorizes and directs any bank that issues a
letter of credit  guaranteed by Foothill to deliver to Foothill all instruments,
documents, and other writings and property received by the issuing bank pursuant
to such letter of credit,  and to accept and rely upon  Foothill's  instructions
and  agreements  with  respect to all matters  arising in  connection  with such
letter of credit and the  related  application.  Borrower  may or may not be the
"applicant" or "account party" with respect to such letter of credit.

              (d) Any and all charges, commissions,  fees, and costs incurred by
Foothill  relating to the  letters of credit  guaranteed  by  Foothill  shall be
considered  Foothill  Expenses for purposes of this  Agreement  and  immediately
shall be reimbursable by Borrower to Foothill.

              (e) Immediately  upon the termination of this Agreement,  Borrower
agrees to either (i) provide cash collateral to be held by Foothill in an amount
equal to 102% of the maximum amount of Foothill's  obligations  under Letters of
Credit,  or (ii) cause to be delivered to Foothill releases of all of Foothill's
obligations under outstanding Letters of Credit. At Foothill's  discretion,  any
proceeds of Collateral  received by Foothill after the occurrence and during the
continuation of an Event of Default may be held as the cash collateral  required
by this Section 2.2(e).

              (f) If by reason of (i) any change in any applicable law,  treaty,
rule, or regulation or any change in the  interpretation  or  application by any
governmental  authority of any such applicable law, treaty, rule, or regulation,
or (ii) compliance by the issuing bank or Foothill with any direction,  request,
or  requirement  (irrespective  of  whether  having  the  force  of  law) of any
governmental  authority or monetary  authority  including,  without  limitation,
Regulation  D of the Board of Governors  of the Federal  Reserve  System as from
time to time in effect (and any successor thereto):

                   (A) any reserve,  deposit, or similar requirement is or shall
be imposed or modified in respect of any Letters of Credit issued hereunder, or

                   (B) there  shall be imposed on the  issuing  bank or Foothill
any other  condition  regarding  any letter of credit,  or Letter of Credit,  as
applicable, issued pursuant hereto;

18

and the result of the foregoing is to increase, directly or indirectly, the cost
to the issuing bank or Foothill of issuing, making, guaranteeing, or maintaining
any  letter of  credit,  or Letter of Credit,  as  applicable,  or to reduce the
amount receivable in respect thereof by such issuing bank or Foothill, then, and
in any such case, Foothill may, at any time within a reasonable period after the
additional cost is incurred or the amount received is reduced,  notify Borrower,
and  Borrower  shall pay on demand such  amounts as the issuing bank or Foothill
may specify to be necessary to compensate  the issuing bank or Foothill for such
additional cost or reduced  receipt,  together with interest on such amount from
the date of such demand  until  payment in full thereof at the rate set forth in
Section  2.6(a)(i) or (c)(i),  as applicable.  The  determination by the issuing
bank or Foothill, as the case may be, of any amount due pursuant to this Section
2.2(f), as set forth in a certificate  setting forth the calculation  thereof in
reasonable detail,  shall, in the absence of manifest or demonstrable  error, be
final and conclusive and binding on all of the parties hereto.

              2.3 Intentionally deleted.

              2.4 Intentionally deleted.

              2.5 OVERADVANCES. If, at any time or for any reason, the amount of
Obligations owed by Borrower to Foothill pursuant to Section 2.1 is greater than
either  the  Dollar  or  percentage  limitations  set forth in  Section  2.1 (an
"Overadvance"),  Borrower immediately shall pay to Foothill, in cash, the amount
of such excess to be used by Foothill first, to repay Advances outstanding under
Section 2.1 and, thereafter, to be held by Foothill as cash collateral to secure
Borrower's obligation to repay Foothill for all amounts paid pursuant to Letters
of Credit.

              2.6  INTEREST  AND LETTER OF CREDIT  FEES:  RATES,  PAYMENTS,  AND
CALCULATIONS.
                   
                   (a)  Interest  Rate.  Except as provided in clause (b) below,
(i) all Obligations  shall bear interest at a per annum rate of one and one half
(1 1/2%) above the Reference Rate..

                   (b) Letter of Credit Fee.  Borrower  shall pay Foothill a fee
(in addition to the charges,  commissions,  fees, and costs set forth in Section
2.2(d))  equal  to 2% per  annum  times  the  aggregate  undrawn  amount  of all
outstanding Letters of Credit.

                   (c)  Default  Rate.   Upon  the  occurrence  and  during  the
continuation of an Event of Default, all Obligations (except for undrawn Letters
of Credit) shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to five and one-half (5
1/2%) percent age points above the Reference Rate.

19

(d) Minimum Interest.  In no event shall the rate of interest
chargeable  hereunder for any day be less than 8.0% per annum. In no event shall
the amount of interest chargeable to the Borrower in any month hereunder be less
than the greater of the actual  amount of interest  hereunder  calculated at the
effective interest rate provided herein or the amount of interest  calculated at
the effective  interest rate  hereunder on an assumed  outstanding  loan balance
equal to (i) Three Million, Five Hundred Thousand  ($3,500,000.00) Dollars, less
(ii) the  amount of any  outstanding  Letters  of  Credit.  To the  extent  that
interest  accrued  hereunder at the rate set forth herein would be less than the
foregoing  minimum daily rate, the interest rate  chargeable  hereunder for such
day  automatically  shall be deemed increased to the minimum rate. To the extent
that  interest  accrued  hereunder at the rate set forth herein  (including  the
minimum interest rate) would yield less than the foregoing  minimum amount,  the
interest  rate  chargeable  hereunder  for the period in question  automatically
shall be deemed  increased to that rate that would result in the minimum  amount
of interest being accrued and payable hereunder.

                   (e)  Payments.  Interest  and Letter of Credit  fees  payable
hereunder shall be due and payable,  in arrears,  on the first day of each month
during the term hereof.  Borrower  hereby  authorizes  Foothill,  at its option,
without  prior notice to Borrower,  to charge such interest and Letter of Credit
fees, all Foothill  Expenses (as and when incurred),  the charges,  commissions,
fees,  and  costs  provided  for in  Section  2.2(d)  (as and  when  accrued  or
incurred),  the fees  and  charges  provided  for in  Section  2.11 (as and when
accrued or incurred),  and all installments or other payments due under the Term
Loan, the Capital  Expenditure  Loans,  or any Loan Document to Borrower's  Loan
Account,  which  amounts  thereafter  shall  accrue  interest  at the rate  then
applicable  to  Advances  hereunder.  Any  interest  not paid  when due shall be
compounded and shall  thereafter  accrue interest at the rate then applicable to
Advances hereunder.

                   (f)  Computation.  The Reference  Rate as of the date of this
Agreement is 8.25% per annum.  In the event the  Reference  Rate is changed from
time to time hereafter,  the applicable rate of interest hereunder automatically
and  immediately  shall be  increased  or  decreased  by an amount equal to such
change in the Reference  Rate. All interest and fees  chargeable  under the Loan
Documents shall be computed on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual number
of days elapsed.

                   (g) Intent to Limit  Charges to Maximum  Lawful  Rate.  In no
event shall the interest rate or rates payable  under this  Agreement,  plus any
other amounts paid in connection  herewith,  exceed the highest rate permissible
under  any  law  that a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  shall,  in a  final
determination,   deem  applicable.  Borrower  and  Foothill,  in  executing  and
delivering  this  Agreement,  intend  legally to agree upon the rate or rates of
interest  and  manner of payment  stated  within it;  provided,  however,  that,
anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if said rate or rates
of interest or manner of payment exceeds the maximum  allowable under applicable
law, then, ipso facto as of the 

20

date of this Agreement,  Borrower is and shall be liable only for the payment of
such maximum as allowed by law, and payment  received from Borrower in excess of
such legal maximum,  whenever received, shall be applied to reduce the principal
balance of the Obligations to the extent of such excess.

              2.7  Collection of Accounts.  Borrower shall at all times maintain
lockboxes  (the  "Lockboxes")  and,  immediately  after the Closing Date,  shall
instruct all Account Debtors with respect to the Accounts,  General Intangibles,
and  Negotiable  Collateral  of  Borrower  to remit all  Collections  in respect
thereof to such Lockboxes. Borrower, Foothill, and the Lockbox Banks shall enter
into the Lockbox  Agreements,  which among other  things  shall  provide for the
opening of a Lockbox  Account for the deposit of  Collections at a Lockbox Bank.
Borrower agrees that all Collections and other amounts received by Borrower from
any  Account  Debtor or any  other  source  immediately  upon  receipt  shall be
deposited  into  a  Lockbox  Account.   No  Lockbox   Agreement  or  arrangement
contemplated  thereby  shall be modified by Borrower  without the prior  written
consent of Foothill.  Upon the terms and subject to the  conditions set forth in
the Lockbox  Agreements,  all amounts  received in each Lockbox Account shall be
wired each Business Day into an account (the "Foothill  Account")  maintained by
Foothill at a depositary selected by Foothill.

              2.8 CREDITING PAYMENTS; Application of Collections. The receipt of
any  Collections by Foothill  (whether from transfers to Foothill by the Lockbox
Banks  pursuant to the Lockbox  Agreements  or otherwise)  immediately  shall be
applied  provisionally to reduce the Obligations  outstanding under Section 2.1,
but shall not be considered a payment on account unless such  Collection item is
a wire  transfer  of  immediately  available  federal  funds  and is made to the
Foothill  Account  or unless  and until such  Collection  item is  honored  when
presented  for  payment.  From and after the  Closing  Date,  Foothill  shall be
entitled to charge  Borrower for (2) Business Days of  `clearance' or `float' at
the rate set forth in Section 2.6(a)(i), on all Collections that are received by
Foothill  (regardless  of whether  forwarded  by the Lockbox  Banks to Foothill,
whether  provisionally  applied to reduce the Obligations  under Section 2.1, or
otherwise).  This  across-the-board  2 Business Day clearance or float charge on
all  Collections is acknowledged by the parties to constitute an integral aspect
of the pricing of Foothill's financing of Borrower, and shall apply irrespective
of the  characterization  of whether receipts are owned by Borrower or Foothill,
and  whether  or not  there are any  outstanding  Advances,  the  effect of such
clearance or float charge being the  equivalent  of charging 2 Business  Days of
interest on such  Collections.  Should any  Collection  item not be honored when
presented  for  payment,  then  Borrower  shall be deemed  not to have made such
payment,  and  interest  shall  be  recalculated  accordingly.  Anything  to the
contrary contained herein  notwithstanding,  any Collection item shall be deemed
received  by  Foothill  only if it is received  into the  Foothill  Account on a
Business Day on or before 11:00 a.m.  California time. If any Collection item is
received  into the Foothill  Account on a  non-Business  Day or after 11:00 a.m.
California  time on a Business  Day, it shall be deemed

21

to  have  been  received  by  Foothill  as of the  opening  of  business  on the
immediately following Business Day.

              2.9  DESIGNATED  ACCOUNT.  Foothill  is  authorized  to  make  the
Advances and the Letters of Credit under this Agreement based upon telephonic or
other  instructions  received from anyone purporting to be an Authorized Person,
or without  instructions  if  pursuant  to Section  2.6(e).  Borrower  agrees to
establish and maintain the Designated  Account with the Designated  Account Bank
for the purpose of receiving the proceeds of the Advances  requested by Borrower
and  made by  Foothill  hereunder.  Unless  otherwise  agreed  by  Foothill  and
Borrower, any Advance requested by Borrower and made by Foothill hereunder shall
be made to the Designated Account.

              2.10  MAINTENANCE  OF LOAN  ACCOUNT;  STATEMENTS  OF  OBLIGATIONS.
Foothill  shall  maintain an account on its books in the name of  Borrower  (the
"Loan  Account") on which  Borrower  will be charged  with all Advances  made by
Foothill to Borrower or for Borrower's  account,  including,  accrued  interest,
Foothill Expenses,  and any other payment Obligations of Borrower. In accordance
with Section 2.8, the Loan Account will be credited  with all payments  received
by Foothill  from  Borrower or for  Borrower's  account,  including  all amounts
received in the Foothill  Account from any Lockbox Bank.  Foothill  shall render
statements  regarding  the  Loan  Account  to  Borrower,   including  principal,
interest,  fees,  and  including  an  itemization  of all charges  and  expenses
constituting  Foothill Expenses owing, and such statements shall be conclusively
presumed to be correct and accurate and  constitute  an account  stated  between
Borrower and Foothill unless,  within 30 days after receipt thereof by Borrower,
Borrower  shall deliver to Foothill  written  objection  thereto  describing the
error or errors contained in any such statements.

              2.11 FEES. Borrower shall pay to Foothill the following fees:

                   (a)  Closing  Fee.  On the  Closing  Date,  a closing  fee of
$60,000.00;

                   (b) Unused  Line Fee.  On the first day of each month  during
the term of this  Agreement,  an unused line fee in an amount  equal to .50% per
annum times the Average Unused Portion of the Adjusted Revolving Amount.

                   (c) Annual  Facility Fee. On each  anniversary of the Closing
Date, an annual facility fee in an amount equal to .25% of the Maximum Amount;

                   (d) Financial Examination, Documentation, and Appraisal Fees.
Foothill's  customary  fee of  $650  per day per  examiner,  plus  out-of-pocket
expenses for each financial analysis and examination (i.e.,  audits) of Borrower
performed by personnel employed by Foothill;  Foothill's customary appraisal fee
of $1,000 per day per appraiser,  plus out-of-pocket expenses for each appraisal
of the Collateral  performed by personnel employed

22

by Foothill;  and, the actual  charges paid or incurred by Foothill if it elects
to employ the services of one or more third  Persons to perform  such  financial
analyses  and  examinations  (i.e.,  audits)  of  Borrower  or to  appraise  the
Collateral;  and, on each anniversary of the Closing Date,  Foothill's customary
fee of $1,000 per year for its loan documentation review; and

                   (e) Servicing  Fee. On the first day of each month during the
term  of  this  Agreement,  and  thereafter  so  long  as  any  Obligations  are
outstanding, a servicing fee in an amount equal to $1,750.00.

          3. CONDITIONS; TERM OF AGREEMENT.

CREDIT. The following shall be conditions precedent to all Advances, all Letters
of Credit, the Term Loan, and all Capital Expenditure Loans hereunder:

                   (a) the  representations  and  warranties  contained  in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all respects
on and as of the date of such  extension of credit,  as though made on and as of
such date (except to the extent that such  representations and warranties relate
solely to an earlier date);

                   (b) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing on the date of such extension of credit, nor shall either result from
the making thereof; and

25

(c) no injunction, writ, restraining order, or other order of
any nature  prohibiting,  directly or  indirectly,  the extending of such credit
shall have been issued and remain in force by any governmental authority against
Borrower, Foothill, or any of their Affiliates.

              3.3  CONDITION  SUBSEQUENT.  As a condition  subsequent to initial
closing hereunder, Borrower shall perform or cause to be performed the following
(the failure by Borrower to so perform or cause to be performed  constituting an
Event of Default):

                   (a) within 30 days of the Closing  Date,  deliver to Foothill
the  certified   copies  of  the  policies  of  insurance,   together  with  the
endorsements thereto, as are required by Section 6.10, the form and substance of
which shall be satisfactory to Foothill and its counsel.

              3.4 TERM; AUTOMATIC RENEWAL. This Agreement shall become effective
upon the  execution  and  delivery  hereof by Borrower  and  Foothill  and shall
continue  in full force and effect for a term  ending on the date (the  "Renewal
Date") that is 5 years from the Closing Date and automatically  shall be renewed
for successive 1 year periods  thereafter,  unless sooner terminated pursuant to
the terms hereof.  Either party may terminate  this  Agreement  effective on the
Renewal Date or on any anniversary of the Renewal Date by giving the other party
at least 90 days prior written notice. The foregoing  notwithstanding,  Foothill
shall  have  the  right  to  terminate  its  obligations  under  this  Agreement
immediately  and without notice upon the occurrence and during the  continuation
of an Event of Default.

              3.5  EFFECT OF  TERMINATION.  On the date of  termination  of this
Agreement,  all Obligations (including contingent  reimbursement  obligations of
Borrower with respect to any outstanding  Letters of Credit)  immediately  shall
become  due and  payable  without  notice  or  demand.  No  termination  of this
Agreement,  however,  shall relieve or discharge  Borrower of Borrower's duties,
Obligations,   or  covenants  hereunder,   and  Foothill's  continuing  security
interests in the Collateral  shall remain in effect until all  Obligations  have
been  fully  and  finally  discharged  and  Foothill's   obligation  to  provide
additional  credit  hereunder  is  terminated.  If Borrower has sent a notice of
termination  pursuant to the  provisions  of Section  3.4,  but fails to pay the
Obligations in full on the date set forth in said notice, then Foothill may, but
shall not be required to, renew this Agreement for an additional term of 1 year.

              3.6 EARLY  TERMINATION BY BORROWER.  The provisions of Section 3.4
that allow  termination  of this  Agreement by Borrower only on the Renewal Date
and certain anniversaries thereof  notwithstanding,  Borrower has the option, at
any time upon 90 days  prior  written  notice to  Foothill,  to  terminate  this
Agreement by paying to Foothill,  in cash, the Obligations  (including an amount
equal to 102% of the undrawn amount of the Letters of Credit), in full, together
with a premium (the "Early Termination Premium") equal to the

26

greater of (a) the total interest and Letter of Credit fees for the  immediately
preceding 6 months, and (b) $50,000.

              3.7 TERMINATION UPON EVENT OF DEFAULT. If Foothill terminates this
Agreement  upon  the  occurrence  of  an  Event  of  Default,  in  view  of  the
impracticability  and extreme  difficulty of ascertaining  actual damages and by
mutual  agreement of the parties as to a reasonable  calculation  of  Foothill's
lost  profits  as a result  thereof,  Borrower  shall pay to  Foothill  upon the
effective  date of such  termination,  a premium in an amount equal to the Early
Termination  Premium.  The Early Termination Premium shall be presumed to be the
amount of damages  sustained by Foothill as the result of the early  termination
and Borrower  agrees that it is  reasonable  under the  circumstances  currently
existing.  The Early Termination  Premium provided for in this Section 3.7 shall
be deemed included in the Obligations.

          4. CREATION OF SECURITY INTEREST.

              4.1 GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST. Borrower hereby grants to Foothill
a continuing  security interest in all currently existing and hereafter acquired
or arising Personal Property  Collateral other than Equipment in order to secure
prompt  repayment  of any and all  Obligations  and in  order to  secure  prompt
performance  by  Borrower  of each of its  covenants  and duties  under the Loan
Documents.  Foothill's  security  interests in the Personal Property  Collateral
shall attach to all Personal Property Collateral without further act on the part
of Foothill or Borrower.  Anything contained in this Agreement or any other Loan
Document to the  contrary  notwithstanding,  except for the sale of Inventory to
buyers in the ordinary course of business, Borrower has no authority, express or
implied,  to dispose of any item or portion of the Personal Property  Collateral
or the Real Property Collateral.

              4.2  NEGOTIABLE  COLLATERAL.  In the  event  that any  Collateral,
including  proceeds,  is  evidenced  by or  consists of  Negotiable  Collateral,
Borrower,  immediately  upon the request of Foothill,  shall endorse and deliver
physical possession of such Negotiable Collateral to Foothill.

              4.3 COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS,  GENERAL  INTANGIBLES,  AND NEGOTIABLE
COLLATERAL.  At any  time,  Foothill  or  Foothill's  designee  may  (a)  notify
customers or Account Debtors of Borrower that the Accounts, General Intangibles,
or Negotiable  Collateral  have been assigned to Foothill or that Foothill has a
security interest therein,  and (b) collect the Accounts,  General  Intangibles,
and Negotiable  Collateral directly and charge the collection costs and expenses
to the Loan Account. Borrower agrees that it will hold in trust for Foothill, as
Foothill's  trustee,  any  Collections  that it receives  and  immediately  will
deliver  said  Collections  to  Foothill in their  original  form as received by
Borrower.

27

4.4 DELIVERY OF  ADDITIONAL  DOCUMENTATION  REQUIRED.  At any time
upon the request of Foothill, Borrower shall execute and deliver to Foothill all
financing  statements,   continuation  financing  statements,  fixture  filings,
security  agreements,  pledges,  assignments,  endorsements  of  certificates of
title,  applications  for title,  affidavits,  reports,  notices,  schedules  of
accounts, letters of authority, and all other documents that Foothill reasonably
may request, in form satisfactory to Foothill, to perfect and continue perfected
Foothill's  security  interests  in  the  Collateral,  and  in  order  to  fully
consummate all of the transactions  contemplated  hereby and under the other the
Loan Documents.

              4.5  POWER  OF  ATTORNEY.   Borrower  hereby   irrevocably  makes,
constitutes,  and appoints Foothill (and any of Foothill's officers,  employees,
or agents  designated by Foothill) as Borrower's true and lawful attorney,  with
power to (a) if Borrower  refuses to, or fails timely to execute and deliver any
of the  documents  described in Section 4.4, sign the name of Borrower on any of
the documents described in Section 4.4, (b) at any time that an Event of Default
has  occurred  and  is  continuing  or  Foothill  deems  itself  insecure,  sign
Borrower's name on any invoice or bill of lading relating to any Account, drafts
against Account Debtors, schedules and assignments of Accounts, verifications of
Accounts,  and notices to Account Debtors, (c) send requests for verification of
Accounts,  (d) endorse Borrower's name on any Collection item that may come into
Foothill's possession, (e) at any time that an Event of Default has occurred and
is  continuing  or  Foothill  deems  itself  insecure,  notify  the post  office
authorities to change the address for delivery of Borrower's  mail to an address
designated by Foothill, to receive and open all mail addressed to Borrower,  and
to retain all mail  relating  to the  Collateral  and  forward all other mail to
Borrower,  (f) at any  time  that  an  Event  of  Default  has  occurred  and is
continuing  or Foothill  deems itself  insecure,  make,  settle,  and adjust all
claims under Borrower's  policies of insurance and make all  determinations  and
decisions  with respect to such policies of insurance,  and (g) at any time that
an Event of Default has  occurred  and is  continuing  or Foothill  deems itself
insecure, settle and adjust disputes and claims respecting the Accounts directly
with Account Debtors,  for amounts and upon terms that Foothill determines to be
reasonable,  and Foothill may cause to be executed and  delivered  any documents
and releases  that  Foothill  determines to be  necessary.  The  appointment  of
Foothill as Borrower's attorney, and each and every one of Foothill's rights and
powers,  being  coupled  with  an  interest,  is  irrevocable  until  all of the
Obligations  have been fully and finally  repaid and  performed  and  Foothill's
obligation to extend credit hereunder is terminated.

              4.6  RIGHT TO  INSPECT.  Foothill  (through  any of its  officers,
employees,  or  agents)  shall have the right,  from time to time  hereafter  to
inspect  Borrower's  Books and to check,  test,  and appraise the  Collateral in
order to verify Borrower's  financial condition or the amount,  quality,  value,
condition of, or any other matter relating to, the Collateral.

              5.10 LITIGATION. There are no actions or proceedings pending by or
against Borrower before any court or administrative agency and Borrower does not
have  knowledge or belief of any pending,  threatened,  or imminent  litigation,
governmental  investigations,  or claims,  complaints,  actions, or prosecutions
involving Borrower or any guarantor of the Obligations,  except for: (a) ongoing
collection matters in which Borrower is the plaintiff;

31

(b) matters  disclosed on Schedule 5.10; and (c) matters  arising after the date
hereof that, if decided adversely to Borrower, would not have a Material Adverse
Change.

              5.11 NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE. All financial statements relating
to Borrower or any  guarantor  of the  Obligations  that have been  delivered by
Borrower to Foothill have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except,  in the
case of unaudited  financial  statements,  for the lack of  footnotes  and being
subject to year-end audit  adjustments)  and fairly present  Borrower's (or such
guarantor's,  as  applicable)  financial  condition  as of the date  thereof and
Borrower's results of operations for the period then ended. There has not been a
Material  Adverse  Change  with  respect  to  Borrower  (or such  guarantor,  as
applicable)  since the date of the  latest  financial  statements  submitted  to
Foothill on or before the Closing Date.

              5.12 SOLVENCY.  Each Borrower is Solvent.  No transfer of property
is being made by Borrower  and no  obligation  is being  incurred by Borrower in
connection  with the  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement or the other
Loan  Documents with the intent to hinder,  delay,  or defraud either present or
future creditors of Borrower.

other than those listed on Schedule 5.13. Borrower, each of its Subsidiaries and
each ERISA Affiliate have satisfied the minimum  funding  standards of ERISA and
the IRC  with  respect  to  each  Benefit  Plan  to  which  it is  obligated  to
contribute.  No ERISA Event has occurred nor has any other event  occurred  that
may result in an ERISA  Event that  reasonably  could be expected to result in a
Material  Adverse  Change.  None of  Borrower  or its  Subsidiaries,  any  ERISA
Affiliate,  or any  fiduciary  of any Plan is subject to any direct or  indirect
liability  with  respect to any Plan under any  applicable  law,  treaty,  rule,
regulation,  or  agreement.  None of Borrower or its  Subsidiaries  or any ERISA
Affiliate is required to provide  security to any Plan under Section  401(a)(29)
of the IRC.

              5.14  ENVIRONMENTAL  CONDITION.  None of Borrower's  properties or
assets has ever been used by Borrower or, to the best of  Borrower's  knowledge,
by previous  owners or  operators  in the  disposal  of, or to  produce,  store,
handle,  treat,  release, or transport,  any Hazardous Materials in violation of
any applicable law or  regulation.  None of Borrower's  properties or assets has
ever been designated or identified in any manner  pursuant to any  environmental
protection  statute as a Hazardous  Materials  disposal site, or a candidate for
closure pursuant to any environmental  protection statute. No Lien arising under
any environmental protection statute has attached to any revenues or to any real
or personal property owned or operated by Borrower.  Borrower has not received a
summons, citation, notice, or directive from the Environmental Protection Agency
or any other  federal  or state  governmental  agency  concerning  any action or
omission by Borrower  resulting  in the  releasing  or  disposing  of  Hazardous
Materials into the environment.

6. AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS.

                   Borrower  covenants  and agrees  that,  so long as any credit
hereunder   shall  be  available  and  until  full  and  final  payment  of  the
Obligations,  and unless Foothill shall otherwise  consent in writing,  Borrower
shall do all of the following:

              6.1  ACCOUNTING  SYSTEM.  Maintain a standard and modern system of
accounting that enables Borrower to produce  financial  statements in accordance
with GAAP,  and  maintain  records  pertaining  to the  Collateral  that contain
information  as from time to time may be requested by  Foothill.  Borrower  also

              6.3  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS,  REPORTS,  CERTIFICATES.   Deliver  to
Foothill:  (a) as soon as  available,  but in any event within 45 days after the
end of each month during each of  Borrower's  fiscal years,  a company  prepared
balance sheet, income statement,  and statement of cash flow covering Borrower's

knowledge  of the  existence  of any Default or Event of Default.  Such  audited
financial  statements shall include a balance sheet,  profit and loss statement,
and  statement  of cash flow  and,  if  prepared,  such  accountants'  letter to
management.  If Borrower  is a parent  company of one or more  Subsidiaries,  or

addition  to the  financial  statements  referred to above,  Borrower  agrees to
deliver financial  statements prepared on a consolidating basis so as to present
Borrower and each such related entity separately, and on a consolidated basis.

                   Together  with the  above,  Borrower  also  shall  deliver to
Foothill Borrower's Form 10-Q Quarterly Reports,  Form 10-K Annual Reports,  and
Form 8-K  Current  Reports,  and any other  filings  made by  Borrower  with the
Securities and Exchange  Commission,  if any, as soon as the same are filed,  or

other  report  reasonably  requested  by  Foothill  relating  to  the  financial
condition of Borrower.

                   Each month,  together with the financial  statements provided
pursuant to Section  6.3(a),  Borrower  shall  deliver to Foothill a certificate
signed  by its  Treasurer  to the  effect  that:  (i) all  financial  statements
delivered or caused to be delivered to Foothill  hereunder have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited financial statements, for
the lack of  footnotes  and being  subject to year-end  audit  adjustments)  and
fairly present the financial condition of Borrower, (ii) the representations and
warranties of Borrower  contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
are true and  correct  in all  material  respects  on and as of the date of such
certificate,  as though  made on and as of such date  (except to the extent that
such representations and warranties relate solely to an earlier date), (iii) for
each month that also is the date on which a financial  covenant in Section  7.20
is to be tested, a Compliance  Certificate  demonstrating  in reasonable  detail
compliance  at the end of such period with the  applicable  financial  covenants
contained in Section 7.20, and (iv) on the date of delivery of such  certificate
to  Foothill  there does not exist any  condition  or event that  constitutes  a
Default or Event of Default (or, in the case of clauses (i), (ii), or (iii),  to
the extent of any non-compliance,  describing such non-compliance as to which he
or she may have  knowledge  and what action  Borrower has taken,  is taking,  or
proposes to take with respect thereto).

                   Borrower  shall  have  issued  written  instructions  to  its
independent  certified public  accountants  authorizing them to communicate with
Foothill and to release to Foothill whatever  financial  information  concerning
Borrower that Foothill may request.  Borrower hereby irrevocably  authorizes and
directs  all  auditors,  accountants,  or other  third 

34

parties to deliver to Foothill,  at  Borrower's  expense,  copies of  Borrower's
financial  statements,  papers related thereto,  and other accounting records of
any nature in their possession, and to disclose to Foothill any information they
may have regarding Borrower's business affairs and financial conditions.

              6.4 TAX RETURNS.  Deliver to Foothill copies of each of Borrower's
future federal income tax returns, and any amendments thereto, within 30 days of
the filing thereof with the Internal Revenue Service.

              6.5  GUARANTOR  REPORTS.  Cause  each  guarantor  of  any  of  the
Obligations to deliver its annual financial statements at the time when Borrower
provides its audited financial  statements to Foothill and copies of all federal
income tax returns as soon as the same are  available  and in any event no later
than 30 days after the same are required to be filed by law.

              6.6  RETURNS.  Cause  returns and  allowances,  if any, as between
Borrower and its Account  Debtors to be on the same basis and in accordance with
the usual  customary  practices  of  Borrower,  as they exist at the time of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement. If, at a time when no Event of Default
has occurred and is  continuing,  any Account  Debtor  returns any  Inventory to
Borrower,  Borrower  promptly shall determine the reason for such return and, if
Borrower accepts such return,  issue a credit memorandum (with a copy to be sent
to Foothill) in the  appropriate  amount to such Account  Debtor.  If, at a time
when an Event of Default has  occurred  and is  continuing,  any Account  Debtor
returns any Inventory to Borrower,  Borrower promptly shall determine the reason
for  such  return  and,  if  Foothill  consents  (which  consent  shall  not  be
unreasonably  withheld),  issue a credit  memorandum  (with a copy to be sent to
Foothill) in the appropriate amount to such Account Debtor.

              6.7 INTENTIONALLY DELETED

              6.8  MAINTENANCE  OF  EQUIPMENT.  Maintain  the  Equipment in good
operating  condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted),  and make all
necessary  replacements  thereto  so that the  value  and  operating  efficiency
thereof shall at all times be maintained and preserved.

              6.9  TAXES.  Cause  all  assessments  and  taxes,   whether  real,
personal,  or  otherwise,  due or payable  by, or imposed,  levied,  or assessed
against Borrower or any of its property to be paid in full,  before  delinquency
or before the expiration of any extension period,  except to the extent that the
validity of such assessment or tax shall be the subject of a Permitted  Protest.
Borrower  shall  make due and timely  payment  or  deposit of all such  federal,
state, and local taxes, assessments, or contributions required of it by law, and
will  execute  and  deliver to  Foothill,  on demand,  appropriate  certificates
attesting to the payment

35

thereof or deposit with respect  thereto.  Borrower will make timely  payment or
deposit of all tax payments and  withholding  taxes required of it by applicable
laws, including those laws concerning F.I.C.A.,  F.U.T.A., state disability, and
local, state, and federal income taxes, and will, upon request, furnish Foothill
with proof  satisfactory  to Foothill  indicating  that  Borrower  has made such
payments or deposits.

              6.10 INSURANCE.

                   (a) At its  expense,  keep the Personal  Property  Collateral
insured against loss or damage by fire, theft,  explosion,  sprinklers,  and all
other hazards and risks, and in such amounts,  as are ordinarily insured against
by other owners in similar  businesses.  Borrower also shall  maintain  business
interruption, public liability, product liability, and property damage insurance
relating to Borrower's ownership and use of the Personal Property Collateral, as
well as insurance against larceny, embezzlement, and criminal misappropriation.

                   (b) Intentionally deleted.

                   (c) Intentionally Deleted.

                   (d) All such  policies  of  insurance  shall be in such form,
with such  companies,  and in such amounts as may be reasonably  satisfactory to
Foothill.  All insurance required herein shall be written by companies which are
authorized  to do  insurance  business  in the State of  California.  All hazard
insurance and such other  insurance as Foothill shall  specify,  shall contain a
California Form 438BFU (NS) mortgagee endorsement,  or an equivalent endorsement
satisfactory to Foothill, showing Foothill as sole loss payee thereof, and shall
contain a waiver of  warranties.  Every policy of insurance  referred to in this
Section  6.10 shall  contain an agreement by the insurer that it will not cancel
such policy except after 30 days prior  written  notice to Foothill and that any
loss payable thereunder shall be payable  notwithstanding  any act or negligence
of  Borrower  or  Foothill  which  might,  absent  such  agreement,  result in a
forfeiture of all or a part of such insurance  payment and  notwithstanding  (i)
occupancy or use of the Real Property  Collateral  for purposes  more  hazardous
than permitted by the terms of such policy, (ii) any foreclosure or other action
or proceeding taken by Foothill  pursuant to the Mortgages upon the happening of
an Event of  Default,  or (iii)  any  change in title or  ownership  of the Real
Property Collateral. Borrower shall deliver to Foothill certified copies of such
policies of insurance and evidence of the payment of all premiums therefor.

                   (e) Original policies or certificates thereof satisfactory to
Foothill  evidencing  such insurance  shall be delivered to Foothill at least 30
days prior to the  expiration  of the existing or preceding  policies.  Borrower
shall give  Foothill  prompt notice of any loss covered by such  insurance,  and
Foothill  shall  have the right to  adjust  any loss. 

36

Foothill  shall have the exclusive  right to adjust all losses payable under any
such insurance policies without any liability to Borrower  whatsoever in respect
of such  adjustments.  Any monies  received  as  payment  for any loss under any
insurance policy including the insurance policies mentioned above, shall be paid
over  to  Foothill  to be  applied  at the  option  of  Foothill  either  to the
prepayment  of the  Obligations  without  premium,  in such  order or  manner as
Foothill may elect,  or shall be disbursed to Borrower under stage payment terms
satisfactory to Foothill for  application to the cost of repairs,  replacements,
or restorations.  All repairs,  replacements,  or restorations shall be effected
with  reasonable  promptness and shall be of a value at least equal to the value
of the items or property destroyed prior to such damage or destruction. Upon the
occurrence  of an Event of Default,  Foothill  shall have the right to apply all
prepaid  premiums  to the  payment of the  Obligations  in such order or form as
Foothill shall determine.

                   (f) Borrower shall not take out separate insurance concurrent
in form or contributing in the event of loss with that required to be maintained
under this Section 6.10,  unless  Foothill is included  thereon as named insured
with the loss  payable to  Foothill  under a  standard  California  438BFU  (NS)
Mortgagee  endorsement,  or its local  equivalent.  Borrower  immediately  shall
notify Foothill  whenever such separate  insurance is taken out,  specifying the
insurer thereunder and full particulars as to the policies  evidencing the same,
and originals of such policies immediately shall be provided to Foothill.

              6.11 NO SETOFFS OR  COUNTERCLAIMS.  Make  payments  hereunder  and
under the other Loan  Documents  by or on behalf of Borrower  without  setoff or
counterclaim and free and clear of, and without  deduction or withholding for or
on account of, any federal, state, or local taxes.

              6.12 LOCATION OF INVENTORY AND  EQUIPMENT.  Keep the Inventory and
Equipment only at the locations identified on Schedule 6.12; provided,  however,
that  Borrower  may  amend  Schedule  6.12 so long as such  amendment  occurs by
written  notice to Foothill not less than 30 days prior to the date on which the
Inventory  or  Equipment  is  moved to such  new  location,  so long as such new
location is within the continental United States, and so long as, at the time of
such written notification, Borrower provides any financing statements or fixture
filings  necessary  to  perfect  and  continue  perfected   Foothill's  security
interests  in such  assets and also  provides to  Foothill a  Collateral  Access
Agreement.

              6.13  COMPLIANCE  WITH LAWS.  Comply with the  requirements of all
applicable laws, rules,  regulations,  and orders of any governmental authority,
including the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Americans With  Disabilities Act,
other than laws, rules,  regulations,  and orders the non-compliance with which,
individually  or in the  aggregate,  would not have and could not  reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Change.

37

Adverse Change, a written  statement of the chief financial  officer of Borrower
describing  such ERISA  Event and any action that is being  taking with  respect
thereto by Borrower,  any such  Subsidiary  or ERISA  Affiliate,  and any action

Subsidiary,  as  applicable,  shall be  deemed  to know all  facts  known by the
administrator  of any  Benefit  Plan  of  which  it is the  plan  sponsor,  (ii)
promptly,  and in any event within 3 Business Days after the filing thereof with
the IRS, a copy of each funding waiver request filed with respect to any Benefit
Plan and all communications received by Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or, to
the knowledge of Borrower, any ERISA Affiliate with respect to such request, and
(iii)  promptly,  and in any event  within 3  Business  Days  after  receipt  by
Borrower,  any of its Subsidiaries  or, to the knowledge of Borrower,  any ERISA
Affiliate,  of the PBGC's  intention  to  terminate a Benefit  Plan or to have a
trustee appointed to administer a Benefit Plan, copies of each such notice.

                   (b)  Cause  to be  delivered  to  Foothill,  upon  Foothill's
request, each of the following: (i) a copy of each Plan (or, where any such plan
is not in writing,  complete  description  thereof) (and if applicable,  related
trust agreements or other funding  instruments) and all amendments thereto,  all

agreements  requiring such  contributions;  (vi) any  information  that has been
provided to Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate regarding withdrawal liability under
any Multiemployer Plan; and (vii) the aggregate amount of the most recent annual
payments  made to former  employees  of Borrower or its  Subsidiaries  under any
Retiree Health Plan.

              6.15  LEASES.  Pay when due all rents and  other  amounts  payable
under any leases to which Borrower is a party or by which Borrower's  properties
and  assets are bound,  unless  such  payments  are the  subject of a  Permitted
Protest.  To the extent that Borrower fails timely to make payment of such rents
and other amounts payable when due under its leases, Foothill shall be entitled,
in its discretion, to reserve an amount equal to such unpaid amounts against the
Borrowing Base.

38

7. NEGATIVE COVENANTS.

              Borrower  covenants  and  agrees  that,  so  long  as  any  credit

Obligations,  Borrower will not do any of the following without Foothill's prior
written consent:

              7.1 INDEBTEDNESS.  Create, incur, assume,  permit,  guarantee,  or

                   (d)  refinancings,  renewals,  or extensions of  Indebtedness
permitted  under  clauses (b) and (c) of this  Section 7.1 (and  continuance  or
renewal of any Permitted Liens  associated  therewith) so long as: (i) the terms
and conditions of such refinancings,  renewals,  or extensions do not materially
impair the prospects of repayment of the  Obligations by Borrower,  (ii) the net
cash proceeds of such refinancings,  renewals, or extensions do not result in an
increase in the aggregate  principal  amount of the  Indebtedness so refinanced,
renewed,  or  extended,  (iii)  such  refinancings,   renewals,  refundings,  or
extensions do not result in a shortening of the average weighted maturity of the
Indebtedness so refinanced,  renewed,  or extended,  and (iv) to the extent that
Indebtedness  that is  refinanced  was  subordinated  in right of payment to the
Obligations,  then the  subordination  terms and  conditions of the  refinancing

the refinanced Indebtedness.

              7.2 LIENS. Create,  incur, assume, or permit to exist, directly or
indirectly, any Lien on or with respect to any of its property or assets, of any

therefrom,  except for Permitted Liens (including Liens that are replacements of
Permitted Liens to the extent that the original Indebtedness is refinanced under
Section 7.1(d) and so long as the  replacement  Liens only encumber those assets
or property that secured the original Indebtedness).

              7.3  RESTRICTIONS ON FUNDAMENTAL  CHANGES.  Enter into any merger,
consolidation,  reorganization,  or recapitalization,  or reclassify its capital

perfected  Foothill's  security  interests  and  also  provides  to  Foothill  a

warehouseman,  or similar party without  Foothill's prior written consent.

indirectly:

                   (a) engage,  or permit any  Subsidiary of Borrower to engage,
in any prohibited  transaction  which is reasonably  likely to result in a civil
penalty or excise tax  described in Sections 406 of ERISA or 4975 of the IRC for
which a statutory or class exemption is not available or a private exemption has
not been previously obtained from the Department of Labor;

                   (b) permit to exist  with  respect  to any  Benefit  Plan any

required to provide  security to such Plan under Section  401(a)(29) of the IRC;
or

                   (h)  withdraw,  or  permit  any  Subsidiary  of  Borrower  to
withdraw, from any Multiemployer Plan where such withdrawal is reasonably likely
to result in any liability of any such entity under Title IV of ERISA;

which,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  results in or  reasonably  would be

          9. FOOTHILL'S RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.

              9.1  RIGHTS  AND  REMEDIES.  Upon the  occurrence,  and during the
continuation,  of an Event of Default  Foothill  may, at its  election,  without
notice of its election and without demand,  do any one or more of the following,
all of which are authorized by Borrower:

                   (a)  Declare  all  Obligations,  whether  evidenced  by  this
Agreement, by any of the other Loan Documents, or otherwise, immediately due and
payable;

                   (b) Cease advancing  money or extending  credit to or for the
benefit of Borrower under this Agreement,  under any of the Loan  Documents,  or
under any other agreement between Borrower and Foothill;

                   (c)  Terminate  this  Agreement  and  any of the  other  Loan
Documents as to any future  liability  or  obligation  of Foothill,  but without
affecting  Foothill's  rights and security  interests  in the Personal  Property
Collateral  or  the  Real  Property   Collateral   and  without   affecting  the
Obligations;

                   (d)  Settle or  adjust  disputes  and  claims  directly  with
Account Debtors for amounts and upon terms which Foothill  considers  advisable,
and in such cases,  Foothill will credit  Borrower's  Loan Account with only the
net amounts  received by Foothill  in payment of such  disputed  Accounts  after
deducting all Foothill Expenses incurred or expended in connection therewith;

                   (e) Cause  Borrower to hold all  returned  Inventory in trust
for  Foothill,  segregate  all  returned  Inventory  from all other  property of
Borrower or in  Borrower's  possession  and  conspicuously  label said  returned
Inventory as the property of Foothill;

                   (f)  Without  notice  to  or  demand  upon  Borrower  or  any
guarantor,  make such payments and do such acts as Foothill considers  necessary
or  reasonable  to protect its security  interests in the  Collateral.  Borrower
agrees to assemble the Personal Property Collateral if Foothill so requires, and
to make the Personal Property  Collateral  available to 

45

Foothill as Foothill may designate.  Borrower  authorizes  Foothill to enter the
premises where the Personal Property Collateral is located, to take and maintain
possession of the Personal Property  Collateral,  or any part of it, and to pay,
purchase,  contest,  or  compromise  any  encumbrance,  charge,  or Lien that in
Foothill's  determination appears to conflict with its security interests and to
pay all  expenses  incurred  in  connection  therewith.  With  respect to any of
Borrower's owned or leased  premises,  Borrower hereby grants Foothill a license
to enter  into  possession  of such  premises  and to occupy  the same,  without
charge,  for up to 120 days in order to  exercise  any of  Foothill's  rights or
remedies provided herein, at law, in equity, or otherwise;

                   (g) Without notice to Borrower  (such notice being  expressly
waived),  and without constituting a retention of any collateral in satisfaction
of an obligation  (within the meaning of Section 9505 of the Code),  set off and
apply to the  Obligations any and all (i) balances and deposits of Borrower held
by Foothill  (including any amounts received in the Lockbox  Accounts),  or (ii)
indebtedness  at any time owing to or for the credit or the  account of Borrower
held by Foothill;

                   (h)  Hold,  as cash  collateral,  any and  all  balances  and
deposits of Borrower held by Foothill,  and any amounts  received in the Lockbox
Accounts, to secure the full and final repayment of all of the Obligations;

                   (i) Ship, reclaim, recover, store, finish, maintain,  repair,
prepare  for sale,  advertise  for sale,  and sell (in the manner  provided  for
herein) the Personal Property  Collateral.  Foothill is hereby granted a license
or other right to use, without charge,  Borrower's labels, patents,  copyrights,
rights of use of any name,  trade  secrets,  trade  names,  trademarks,  service
marks,  and  advertising  matter,  or any  property of a similar  nature,  as it
pertains to the Personal  Property  Collateral,  in  completing  production  of,
advertising  for  sale,  and  selling  any  Personal  Property   Collateral  and
Borrower's rights under all licenses and all franchise agreements shall inure to
Foothill's benefit;

                   (j) Sell the Personal Property  Collateral at either a public
or private sale, or both, by way of one or more contracts or  transactions,  for
cash or on  terms,  in such  manner  and at such  places  (including  Borrower's
premises) as Foothill determines is commercially reasonable. It is not necessary
that the Personal Property Collateral be present at any such sale;

                   (k)  Foothill  shall give  notice of the  disposition  of the
Personal Property Collateral as follows:

                   (l)  Foothill  shall  give  Borrower  and  each  holder  of a
security  interest  in the  Personal  Property  Collateral  who has  filed  with
Foothill a written request for notice, a notice in writing of the time and place
of public  sale,  or, if the sale is a 

46

private sale or some other disposition other than a public sale is to be made of
the Personal  Property  Collateral,  then the time on or after which the private
sale or other disposition is to be made;

                        (2) The notice shall be personally  delivered or mailed,
postage  prepaid,  to Borrower as provided in Section 12, at least 5 days before
the date  fixed for the  sale,  or at least 5 days  before  the date on or after
which the private sale or other disposition is to be made; no notice needs to be
given  prior  to  the  disposition  of any  portion  of  the  Personal  Property
Collateral that is perishable or threatens to decline  speedily in value or that
is of a type  customarily sold on a recognized  market.  Notice to Persons other
than Borrower claiming an interest in the Personal Property  Collateral shall be
sent to such addresses as they have furnished to Foothill;

                        (3) If the sale is to be a public  sale,  Foothill  also
shall give notice of the time and place by publishing a notice one time at least
5 days before the date of the sale in a newspaper of general  circulation in the
county in which the sale is to be held;

                   (l)  Foothill may credit bid and purchase at any public sale;
and

                   (m) Any  deficiency  that  exists  after  disposition  of the
Personal  Property  Collateral  as provided  above will be paid  immediately  by
Borrower.  Any excess  will be  returned,  without  interest  and subject to the
rights of third Persons, by Foothill to Borrower.

              9.2 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. Foothill's rights and remedies under this
Agreement,  the Loan Documents,  and all other  agreements  shall be cumulative.
Foothill shall have all other rights and remedies not  inconsistent  herewith as
provided  under the Code,  by law, or in equity.  No exercise by Foothill of one
right or remedy  shall be deemed an  election,  and no waiver by Foothill of any
Event of Default shall be deemed a continuing waiver. No delay by Foothill shall
constitute a waiver, election, or acquiescence by it.

          10. TAXES AND EXPENSES.

              If Borrower fails to pay any monies (whether  taxes,  assessments,
insurance  premiums,  or, in the case of leased  properties or assets,  rents or
other amounts payable under such leases) due to third Persons,  or fails to make
any  deposits  or furnish  any  required  proof of payment  or  deposit,  all as
required  under the terms of this  Agreement,  then, to the extent that Foothill
determines  that such  failure by Borrower  could  result in a Material  Adverse
Change, in its discretion and without prior notice to Borrower,  Foothill may do
any or all of the  following:  (a) make payment of the same or any part thereof;
(b) set up such reserves in Borrower's  Loan Account as Foothill deems necessary
to protect Foothill from the exposure created by such failure; or (c) obtain and
maintain  insurance policies of the type described 

47

in Section  6.10,  and take any action with respect to such policies as Foothill
deems  prudent.  Any such amounts  paid by Foothill  shall  constitute  Foothill
Expenses.  Any such payments made by Foothill  shall not constitute an agreement
by  Foothill to make  similar  payments in the future or a waiver by Foothill of
any Event of Default under this  Agreement.  Foothill need not inquire as to, or
contest the validity of, any such  expense,  tax, or Lien and the receipt of the
usual official notice for the payment thereof shall be conclusive  evidence that
the same was validly due and owing.

          11. WAIVERS; INDEMNIFICATION.

              11.1 DEMAND; PROTEST; ETC. Borrower waives demand, protest, notice
of protest,  notice of default or  dishonor,  notice of payment and  nonpayment,
nonpayment at maturity, release, compromise,  settlement,  extension, or renewal
of accounts, documents,  instruments,  chattel paper, and guarantees at any time
held by Foothill on which Borrower may in any way be liable.

              11.2  FOOTHILL'S  LIABILITY  FOR  COLLATERAL.  So long as Foothill
complies with its obligations,  if any, under Section 9207 of the Code, Foothill
shall not in any way or manner be liable or responsible for: (a) the safekeeping
of the  Collateral;  (b) any loss or damage thereto  occurring or arising in any
manner or fashion from any cause;  (c) any diminution in the value  thereof;  or
(d) any act or default of any carrier, warehouseman,  bailee, forwarding agency,
or other Person.  All risk of loss,  damage,  or  destruction  of the Collateral
shall be borne by Borrower.

              11.3 INDEMNIFICATION.  Borrower shall pay, indemnify,  defend, and
hold  Foothill,  each  Participant,  and  each  of  their  respective  officers,
directors,   employees,   counsel,   agents,  and  attorneys-in-fact  (each,  an
"Indemnified Person") harmless (to the fullest extent permitted by law) from and
against  any  and  all  claims,   demands,   suits,   actions,   investigations,
proceedings,  and damages,  and all reasonable  attorneys fees and disbursements
and other costs and expenses actually  incurred in connection  therewith (as and
when they are incurred and irrespective of whether suit is brought), at any time
asserted against, imposed upon, or incurred by any of them in connection with or
as a result of or related to the execution, delivery, enforcement,  performance,
and  administration  of this  Agreement  and any  other  Loan  Documents  or the
transactions  contemplated  herein,  and  with  respect  to  any  investigation,
litigation, or proceeding related to this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or
the use of the  proceeds  of the  credit  provided  hereunder  (irrespective  of
whether any Indemnified Person is a party thereto), or any act, omission,  event
or circumstance in any manner related thereto (all the foregoing,  collectively,
the  "Indemnified  Liabilities").  Borrower  shall  have  no  obligation  to any
Indemnified  Person  under this  Section  11.3 with  respect to any  Indemnified
Liability  that a court of competent  jurisdiction  finally  determines  to have
resulted  from the gross  negligence or willful  misconduct of such 

48

Indemnified  Person.  This  provision  shall  survive  the  termination  of this
Agreement and the repayment of the Obligations.

          12. NOTICES.

              Unless  otherwise  provided  in this  Agreement,  all  notices  or
demands by any party relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall
be in writing and  (except  for  financial  statements  and other  informational

14. DESTRUCTION OF BORROWER'S DOCUMENTS.

              All  documents,  schedules,  invoices,  agings,  or  other  papers
delivered to Foothill  may be  destroyed or otherwise  disposed of by Foothill 4
months  after they are  delivered to or received by  Foothill,  unless  Borrower
requests, in writing, the return of said documents,  schedules,  or other papers

          15. GENERAL PROVISIONS.

              15.1  EFFECTIVENESS.  This  Agreement  shall be binding and deemed
effective when executed by Borrower and Foothill.

              15.2  SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.  This Agreement shall bind and inure
to the benefit of the respective  successors and assigns of each of the parties;
provided,  however, that Borrower may not assign this Agreement or any rights or
duties  hereunder  without  Foothill's  prior written consent and any prohibited
assignment  shall be  absolutely  void.  No consent to an assignment by Foothill
shall release Borrower from its Obligations.  Foothill may assign this Agreement
and its rights and duties  hereunder  and no consent or  approval by Borrower is
required in connection with any such assignment.  Foothill reserves the right to
sell, assign,  transfer,  negotiate,  or grant participations in all or any part
of, or any interest in Foothill's rights and benefits  hereunder.  In connection

Borrower's  business.  To the  extent  that  Foothill  assigns  its  rights  and
obligations  hereunder to a third Person,  Foothill thereafter shall be released
from such assigned  obligations to Borrower and such  assignment  shall effect a
novation between Borrower and such third Person.

              15.7 COUNTERPARTS;  TELEFACSIMILE EXECUTION. This Agreement may be

the same  Agreement.  Delivery of an executed  counterpart  of this Agreement by

or payment of the Obligations by Borrower or any guarantor of the Obligations or
the  transfer by either or both of such  parties to Foothill of any  property of

be void or  voidable  under any state or  federal  law  relating  to  creditors'
rights,  including  provisions  of the  Bankruptcy  Code  relating to fraudulent
conveyances, preferences, and other voidable or recoverable payments of money or
transfers of property (collectively,  a "Voidable Transfer"), and if Foothill is
required to repay or restore,  in whole or in part, any such Voidable  Transfer,
or elects to do so upon the  reasonable  advice of its counsel,  then, as to any
such  Voidable  Transfer,  or the amount  thereof  that  Foothill is required or
elects  to repay or  restore,  and as to all  reasonable  costs,  expenses,  and
attorneys fees of Foothill  related  thereto,  the liability of Borrower or such
guarantor  automatically  shall be revived,  reinstated,  and restored and shall
exist as though such Voidable Transfer had never been made.

SECURED TERM PROMISSORY NOTE
                          ----------------------------

$8,000,000.00                                              Boston, Massachusetts
                                                           November 25, 1996

FOR VALUE RECEIVED,  the undersigned BPI Packaging  Technologies,  Inc.
and RC America,  Inc.  (collectively,  the "Maker") hereby jointly and severally
promise to pay to FOOTHILL CAPITAL CORPORATION ("Foothill"),  or order, at 11111
Santa Monica Boulevard, Los Angeles, California, or at such other address as the
holder may specify in writing,  the  principal  sum of Eight  Million and 00/100
Dollars  ($8,000,000.00)  or such lesser amount as may be advanced hereunder and
under the Loan  Agreement,  plus  interest  in the manner and upon the terms and
conditions set forth below.

1.       RATE OF INTEREST
         ----------------

         This Secured  Promissory  Note (this "Note") shall bear interest at the
rate of one and  one-half  (1.50%)  percent per annum plus the  Reference  Rate,
computed  on the basis of a three  hundred  sixty (360) day year for actual days
elapsed.

         For purposes of this Note,  the Reference  Rate shall mean the variable
rate of  interest,  per  annum,  most  recently  announced  by  Norwest  Bank of
Minnesota,  N.A. or any successor  thereto,  as its "base rate,"  whether or not
such announced rate is the best rate available from such financial institution.

         The  Reference  Rate as of this date is eight and one  quarter  percent
(8.25%)  per  annum.  In the  event  the  Reference  Rate is  from  time to time
hereafter changed, the rate of interest provided in this Note shall be increased
or decreased by an amount equal to the Reference Rate change. For each month the
rate of interest charged under this Note shall be based

1

on the average Reference Rate in effect during such month.

         In no event  shall the amount of  interest  chargeable  to Maker in any
month be less  than the  greater  of the  actual  amount of  interest  hereunder
calculated  at the  effective  interest  rate  provided  herein or the amount of
interest  calculated  at the  effective  interest  rate  hereunder on an assumed
outstanding   balance  equal  to  (i)  Three   Million  Five  Hundred   Thousand
($3,500,000.00)  Dollars,  less (ii) the  amount of any  outstanding  Letters of
Credit. 

         In no event shall the interest rate  chargeable  hereunder be less than
eight (8.0%) percent per annum. Any interest not paid when due may be compounded
by adding  it to  principal  and  thereafter  shall  bear  interest  at the rate
provided  herein.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under that certain
Loan and Security  Agreement  dated November 25, 1996 between Maker and Foothill
(the "Agreement"),  the rate of interest on this Note shall, at holder's option,
be  increased to five and one-half  percent  (5.50%)  percent per annum plus the
then applicable effective interest rate under the Note, computed on the basis of
a three  hundred  sixty (360) day year for actual days  elapsed.

2.      Schedule of Payments
        --------------------

         Interest  under this Note shall be due and  payable on the first day of
each month commencing December 1, 1996 and continuing through November 25, 2001,
at which time the entire remaining  principal  balance owing and all accrued and
unpaid interest and charges shall be paid in full. During the term of this Note,
payments of principal  shall be made in  accordance  with the  provisions of the
Loan Agreement.

2

3.       Prepayment
         ----------
         This Note may be prepaid in full, at any time, provided however,  Maker
shall pay to  Lender,  together  with such  prepayment,  a premium  equal to the
greater of (a) the total interest hereunder for the then immediately  preceeding
six months and the letter of credit fees (as required in the
Agreement) for the then immediately proceeding six months and (b) $50,000.00.

4.       Holder's Right of Acceleration
         ------------------------------
         Upon  the  occurrence  of an  Event  of  Default  under  the  Agreement
including,  but not limited to, the failure to pay any  installment  of interest
hereunder  when due,  the holder of this Note may, at its  election  and without
notice to Maker, declare the entire balance hereof immediately due and payable.

5.       Additional Rights of Holder
         ---------------------------
         If any  installment  of interest  hereunder  is not paid when due,  the
holder  shall  have the  following  rights in  addition  to the rights set forth
elsewhere  herein,  in the  Agreement  and under law:  

         (a) the right to  compound  interest  by adding the unpaid  interest to
principal,  with such amount thereafter bearing interest at the rate provided in
this Note; and

         (b) if any  installment  is more than ten (10) days past due, the right
to  collect a charge  equal to the  greater  of  Fifteen  Dollars  ($15) or five
percent (5%) of the late payment for the month in which it is late.  This charge
is a result of a  reasonable  endeavor by Maker and the holder to  estimate  the
holder's  added costs and Maker's  failure to make  timely  payments  under this
Note;  hence Maker  agrees that the charge shall be presumed to be the amount of
damage sustained by the holder since it is

3

extremely  difficult to determine the actual  amount  necessary to reimburse the
holder for damages.

6.       General Provisions
         ------------------
         (a) If this Note is not paid when due,  Maker  further  promises to pay
all costs of  collection,  foreclosure  fees,  and  reasonable  attorneys'  fees
incurred by the holder, whether or not suit is filed hereon.

         (b) If there is more  than one  Maker,  then  each  Maker  agrees to be
jointly and severally liable on this Note.

         (c) Maker hereby consents to any and all renewals,  replacements and/or
extensions of time for payment of this Note before, at or after maturity.

         (d) Maker hereby consents to the acceptance, release or substitution of
security for this Note.

         (e) Presentment for payment, notice of dishonor,  protest and notice of
protest are hereby expressly waived.

         (f) Any  waiver of any  rights  by the  holder  under  this  Note,  the
Agreement or under any other  agreement,  instrument or paper signed by Maker is
neither valid nor  effective  unless made in writing and signed by the holder of
this Note.

         (g) No delay or  omission  on the part of the  holder  of this  Note in
exercising any right shall operate as a waiver thereof or of any other right.

         (h) A waiver by the holder of this Note upon any one occasion shall not
be construed as a bar or waiver of any right or remedy on any future occasion.

         (i) Should any one or more of the provisions of this Note be determined
illegal  or  unenforceable,  all  other  provisions  shall  nevertheless  remain
effective.

4

(j) This Note  cannot  be  changed,  modified,  amended  or  terminated
orally.

         (k)  This  Note  shall  be  governed  by,  construed  and  enforced  in
accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without reference
to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

         (l) Capitalized  terms used but not defined in this Note shall have the
meanings given them in the Loan Agreement.

         (m)  THE  VALIDITY  OF  THIS  NOTE,  THE  AGREEMENT  OR ANY  MATTER  OR
PROCEEDING  RELATING HERETO OR THERETO,  ITS CONSTRUCTION,  INTERPRETATION,  AND
ENFORCEMENT  AND THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES  HERETO  SHALL BE  DETERMINED  UNDER,
GOVERNED  BY,  AND  CONSTRUED  IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH  THE  INTERNAL  LAWS  OF THE
COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW.
THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ALL ACTIONS OR  PROCEEDINGS  ARISING IN  CONNECTION  WITH
THIS NOTE OR THE AGREEMENT  SHALL BE TRIED AND  LITIGATED  ONLY IN THE STATE AND
FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN SUFFOLK  COUNTY,  COMMONWEALTH OF  MASSACHUSETTS,  THE
COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES,  CALIFORNIA,  OR, AT THE SOLE OPTION OF FOOTHILL,  IN ANY
OTHER COURT IN WHICH FOOTHILL SHALL INITIATE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE  PROCEEDINGS AND
WHICH HAS JURISDICTION OVER THE PARTIES AND MATTER IN CONTROVERSY. EACH OF MAKER
AND FOOTHILL  WAIVES,  TO THE EXTENT  PERMITTED UNDER  APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT
EACH MAY HAVE TO ASSERT THE  DOCTRINE  OF FORUM NON  CONVENIENS  OR TO OBJECT TO
VENUE TO THE EXTENT ANY PROCEEDING IS BROUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION 6.
MAKER AND FOOTHILL HEREBY WAIVE THEIR  RESPECTIVE  RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY
CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF ANY OF THE LOAN  DOCUMENTS
OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREIN, INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT
CLAIMS,  BREACH OF DUTY  CLAIMS AND ALL OTHER  COMMON LAW OR  STATUTORY  CLAIMS.

5

 PLEDGE AND SECURITY AGREEMENT

PLEDGE AND SECURITY AGREEMENT

         This  Pledge  and  Security  Agreement  is made as of the  25th  day of
November, 1996 between BPI Packaging Technologies,  Inc., a Delaware corporation
with a place of business at 455 Somerset  Avenue,  North Dighton,  Massachusetts
("Pledgor") and Foothill Capital  Corporation,  a California  corporation with a
place of business at 11111 Santa  Monica  Boulevard,  Suite 1500,  Los  Angeles,
California ("Pledgee").

         1. Pledge of Collateral.  Pledgor hereby grants to Pledgee a continuing
security  interest  in and to,  and  assigns  and  pledges  to the  Pledgee  the
following   items  and  types  of   property,   and  all   products,   proceeds,
substitutions,   additions,   interest,   dividends   and  other   distributions
(including, without limitation, stock splits) in respect thereto, and all books,
records  and papers  relating  to the  foregoing  (all of which is  referred  to
hereinafter as the "Collateral"):  All of Pledgor's right, title and interest in
and to all  securities,  investments  and  property  described  in the  attached
Schedule  "A",  together with all interest,  cash  dividends,  rights to receive
dividends,  stock  dividends,  distributions  upon  redemption  or  liquidation,
distributions   as   a   result   of   split-ups,    mergers,    consolidations,
reorganizations, dissolutions, conversions, recapitalizations or rearrangements,
all stock  rights,  rights  to  subscribe,  voting  rights,  rights  to  receive
securities and all other property or securities of any type whatsoever which the
Pledgor is or may  become  entitled  to  receive  on account of the  securities,
investments  and property  described in Schedule "A",  together with all rights,
titles, interest, privileges and preferences appertaining or incidental thereto,
together with all cash and non-cash proceeds of any or all of the foregoing.

         2. Obligations Secured. The security interest in the Collateral granted
hereby secures  payments and  performance of all debts,  obligations,  loans and
liabilities  of Pledgor to Pledgee,  whether now existing or  hereafter  arising
(the "Obligations") under that certain Loan and Security Agreement dated of even
date  herewith  among  Pledgor,   RC  America,   Inc.  and  Pledgee  (the  "Loan
Agreement").  This Pledge  Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until
all of the Obligations,  and any extensions or renewals  thereof,  together with
interest  accruing  thereon,  shall be finally and  irrevocably  paid in full at
which time Pledgee shall convey the Collateral to Pledgor without recourse.

         3.  Perfection  of  Security  Interest.  All  income  from the  Pledged
Accounts shall be reported to taxing authorities as income of the Pledgor.

         4.  Pledgee's Rights and Duties with Respect to the Collateral.

         (a)  Pledgee's only duty with  respect  to the  Collateral  shall be to
exercise reasonable care to secure the safe custody of such Collateral as may be
in the actual  possession of Pledgee.  Pledgee shall have the right, but not the
obligation to pay any taxes,  liens,  assessments,  insurance  premiums or other
charges  pertaining to  Collateral.  Any expenses  incurred by Pledgee under the
preceding sentence shall be paid to Pledgee by Pledgor upon demand,  become part
of the  Obligations  secured by the  Collateral and bear interest at the default
rate provided in the Loan

Agreement until paid.  Pledgee shall be relieved of all  responsibility  for all
Collateral which may be in Pledgee's possession upon surrendering it to Pledgor.

         (b)  The  Pledgor   hereby  designates  the  Pledgee  as  and  for  the
attorney-in-fact  and proxy of the Pledgor  to:  endorse in favor of the Pledgee
any of the  Collateral;  cause the transfer of any of the  Collateral  into such
name or into an account as the Pledgee may, from time to time, determine;  cause
the issuance of certificates  for book entry and/or  uncertificated  securities;
renew, extend, or roll over any Collateral; and make demand and initiate actions
to enforce  any of the  Collateral,  and  receive and collect all money or money
damages  payable on account of any of the Collateral;  and protect,  preserve or
assert any other  rights of Pledgor or take any other action with respect to the
Collateral.  The Pledgee may take such action with respect to the  Collateral as
the Pledgee may reasonably determine to be necessary to protect and preserve its
interest  in the  Collateral.  The  rights,  remedies,  powers,  privileges  and
discretions included in this Section 4(b) may be exercised by the Pledgee at any
time after the occurrence of an Event of Default. The within designation,  being
coupled  with  an  interest,  is  irrevocable  until  the  within  Agreement  is
terminated by a written instrument  executed by a duly authorized officer of the
Pledgee. The power of attorney shall not be affected by subsequent disability or
incapacity  of the  Pledgor.  The  Pledgee  shall not be  liable  for any act or
omission  to act  pursuant  to this  Section,  except  for  Pledgee's  own gross
negligence and for any act or omission of Pledgee which is in actual bad faith.

5. Pledgor's Covenants,  Warranties and Indemnify.  Pledgor represents,
warrants and covenants

         (a) that Pledgor is the lawful  owner of all right,  title and interest
in the  Collateral  and will not  encumber  or  suffer  the  encumbrance  of the
Collateral except in favor of Pledgee,

         (b) that the Collateral is and will be fully paid and non-assessable,

         (c) that Pledgor will not:

                  i.         cause or  permit  any of the  Collateral  presently
                             evidenced by a written  certificate to be converted
                             to uncertificated securities;

                  ii.        exercise any right with  respect to the  Collateral
                             which would adversely  affect the Pledgee's  rights
                             in the Collateral;

                  iii.       file any  affidavit of lost stock  certificates  or
                             bonds; or

                  iv.        vote the  Collateral  in favor of or consent to any
                             resolution  which might impose any  restrictions on
                             the   sale,   transfer   or   disposition   of  the
                             Collateral.

2

(d) that the  Collateral represents 100% of the issued and  outstanding
capital stock of each of RC America,  Inc.,  Market Media,  Inc., BPI Packaging,
Inc. and BPI Packaging  Limited  (collectively,  the  "Subsidiaries"),  and that
Pledgor  shall not  permit any of the  Subsidiaries  to  authorize  or issue any
further capital stock or securities or rights  convertible into capital stock at
any time that there remain any Obligations of Pledgor to Pledgee without written
consent of Pledgee, and

         (e) that the Collateral is and will remain free and clear of all liens,
encumbrances and security  interests other than the security interest granted by
Pledgor hereunder, and

         (f) that Pledgor has the sole right and lawful  authority to pledge the
Collateral and otherwise to comply with the provisions hereof. In the event that
any  adverse  claim is  asserted  in respect of the  Collateral  or any  portion
thereof,  except  such as may  result  from  an act of  Pledgee  not  authorized
hereunder,  Pledgor  promises and agrees to  indemnify  Pledgee and hold Pledgee
harmless from and against any losses, liabilities,  damages, expenses, costs and
reasonable  counsel fees incurred by Pledgee in exercising  any right,  power or
remedy of Pledgee  hereunder or defending,  protecting or enforcing the security
interest  created  hereunder.  Any such loss,  liability  or expense so incurred
shall be paid by Pledgor upon demand,  become part of the Obligations secured by
the Collateral  and bear interest,  at the default rate of interest set forth in
the Loan Agreement and related documents, until paid.

6. Pledgor's  Default.  Pledgor shall be in default  hereunder upon the
occurrence of any of the following events ("Events of Default"):

         Pledgor's failure to pay or perform any of the Obligations described in
this  Agreement or under the Loan  Agreement when such payment or performance is
due.

         7. Rights Appertaining to Collateral.

         (a)  Prior to  Event of  Default:  Prior  to an Event of  Default,  the
Pledgor shall be entitled to vote the Collateral and give consents,  waivers and
ratifications in respect thereof subject to the requirements of Section 5 above,
and to the extent allowed by the Loan Agreement, any cash interest, dividends or
distributions received from the Collateral.

         (b) Pledgee's Rights Upon Default.  Upon the occurrence of any Event of
Default,  the rights of the Pledgor  pursuant  to  Subsection  (a) hereof  shall
automatically  and  immediately  cease and Pledgee,  if Pledgee so elects at its
sole option, in addition to exercising rights granted under Section 4(b):

                  i. may vote  all or any  part of the  Collateral  and give all
consents,  waivers  and  ratifications  in respect  thereof,  sell or convey the
Collateral,  cause the Collateral to be transferred  into its own name, into its
own account or the name or account of its nominee and otherwise act with respect
thereto  as  the  absolute  owner  thereof  (the  Pledgor   hereby   irrevocably
constituting and appointing Pledgee Pledgor's proxy and  attorney-in-fact,  with
full power of  substitution,  to do so,  which 

3

appointment is coupled with an interest) and exercise all rights with respect to
the Collateral as though Pledgee were the absolute owner thereof, whether or not
such rights  were  retained  by Pledgor as against  Pledgee  before the Event of
Default; and

                  ii. may exercise all other rights available to a secured party
under the Uniform  Commercial Code and other applicable law,  including  without
limitation the right to apply  Pledgor's  rights to the  Collateral  against the
Obligations  regardless  of  the  adequacy  or  existence  of  other  collateral
therefor.

                        Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing,  upon
the occurrence of any Event of Default, and at any time thereafter,  the Pledgee
shall have all of the rights and remedies  which a secured  party is entitled to
exercise  upon  default  under  the  Uniform   Commercial  Code  as  adopted  in
Massachusetts, in addition to which the Pledgee may sell or otherwise dispose of
the  Collateral (in one or more sales) and/or enforce and collect the Collateral
(including,   without  limitation,   the  liquidation  of  debt  instruments  or
securities  and the exercise of  conversion  rights with respect to  convertible
securities,  whether or not such  instruments  or  securities  have  matured and
whether or not any  penalties  or other  charges  are imposed on account of such
action),  for application towards (but not necessarily in complete  satisfaction
of) the  Obligations.  The Pledgor  shall  remain  liable to the Pledgee for any
deficiency  remaining  following  such  application.  Any such  sale may be made
either at public or private sale at Pledgee's place of business or elsewhere, or
at any brokers' board or securities exchange,  either or cash or upon receipt or
for  future  delivery,  at such  price as  Pledgee  may deem fair (to the extent
permitted by law),  and Pledgee may be the purchaser of any or all Collateral so
sold and may hold the same  thereafter  in its own right  free from any claim of
Pledgor or right of redemption.  No such purchase or holding by Pledgee shall be
deemed a retention by Pledgee in  satisfaction  of the  Obligations.  Unless the
Collateral,  threatens to decline speedily in value, or is of a type customarily
sold on a recognized  market (in which event the Pledgee  shall give the Pledgor
such notice as may be practicable  under the  circumstances),  the Pledgee shall
give the Pledgor at least the greater of the minimum  notice  required by law or
seven (7) days prior written  notice of the date,  time, and place of any public
sale thereof or of the time after which any private  sale or any other  intended
disposition  is to be made.  The Pledgor  acknowledges  that any exercise by the
Pledgee of the Pledgee's  right upon default may be subject to compliance by the
Pledgee  with any statute,  regulation,  ordinance,  directive,  or order of any
federal,   state,   municipal,  or  other  governmental  authority  ("Securities
Regulations"),  and Pledgee may impose, without limitation, any of the foregoing
restricting the sale of securities in order to comply with applicable Securities
Regulations.  The Pledgee,  in its  reasonable  discretion  at any such sale, in
order to  comply  with  applicable  Securities  Regulations,  may  restrict  the
prospective  bidders or purchasers  as to their  number,  nature of business and
investment  intention,  and impose,  without limitation,  a requirement that the
persons making such purchases  represent and agree,  to the  satisfaction of the
Pledgee,  that they are purchasing  the  Collateral  for their own account,  for
investment, and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof.

4

8. Application of Sale Proceeds.  In the event of a sale of Collateral,
the proceeds  shall first be applied to the payment of the expenses of the sale,
including brokers' commissions, counsel fees, any taxes or other charges imposed
by law upon the Collateral or the transfer thereof and all other charges paid or
incurred by Pledgee pertaining to the sale; and, second, to satisfy  outstanding
Obligations,  in the order in which Pledgee elects in its sole  discretion,  any
statute,  custom,  or usage to the contrary  notwithstanding;  and,  third,  the
surplus (if any) shall be paid to Pledgor.

         9. Return of Collateral.  If any Collateral is held by the Pledgee, the
Pledgee shall return to the Pledgor  certificates  evidencing the Collateral and
any blank  stock  powers  delivered  to the Pledgee  pursuant to this  Agreement
hereof (together with any other securities and transfer  documents  delivered to
the  Pledgee  under the terms  hereof  and,  where  appropriate,  satisfactions,
releases, discharges and notices of termination of this Agreement, duly executed
and  acknowledged and in proper form for filing or recording) upon the final and
irrevocable payment and performance of all of the Obligations.

         10.       Further Documents and Assurances.

                  (a) The  Pledgor  shall,  from  time  to  time  and at his own
expense,  promptly execute,  acknowledge,  witness, deliver, file and record (or
procure  the  execution,   acknowledgment,   witnessing,  delivery,  filing  and
recordation  of) such  documents or  instruments  (and shall take or cause to be
taken such other action) as Pledgee may reasonably request for the perfection of
the security  interests  created hereby and for the  continuation and protection
thereof. The Pledgor shall promptly furnish to Pledgee evidence  satisfactory to
Pledgee of such filing and recordation.  In addition,  the Pledgor shall execute
all such instruments,  documents,  and papers,  and will do all such acts as the
Pledgee may request  from time to time to carry into effect the  provisions  and
intent of this Agreement,  including,  without limitation, the execution of stop
transfer orders, stock powers,  notifications to obligors on the Collateral, the
providing of notification  in connection  with book entry  securities or general
intangibles,  and the providing of instructions to the issuers of uncertificated
securities,  and will do all such other acts as the  Pledgee  may  request  with
respect to the perfection and protection of the security interest granted herein
and the  assignment  effected  hereby.  Without  limiting the  generality of the
foregoing,  Pledgor shall,  contemporaneously  herewith, deliver to Pledgee such
duly  executed  financing  statements  and  consents as may be  necessary in the
judgment of Pledgee to perfect  Pledgee's  security  interests in any Collateral
and shall execute,  acknowledge,witness,  deliver,  file and record such Uniform
Commercial Code financing and  continuation  statements,  notices and additional
security  agreements,  make such  notations on their records and take such other
actions as Pledgee may  reasonably  request  for the  purpose of so  perfecting,
maintaining and protecting its security interests hereunder.

         11. Notices. All notices, demands and other communications by one party
hereunder  to the other shall be in writing and shall be deemed  effective  when
sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt

                  (a) The rights, remedies,  powers, privileges, and discretions
of the Pledgee  hereunder  (hereinafter,  the  "Pledgee's  Rights and Remedies")
shall  be  cumulative  and  not  exclusive  of  any  rights,  remedies,  powers,
privileges or discretions  which Pledgee  otherwise may have under the Agreement
or  otherwise.  No delay or omissions by the Pledgee in  exercising or enforcing
any of the  Pledgee's  Rights and Remedies  shall operate as, or  constitute,  a
waiver  thereof.  No waiver by the  Pledgee  of any Event of  Default  or of any
default under any other agreement shall operate as a waiver of any other default
hereunder  or under any other  agreement.  No exercise  of any of the  Pledgee's
Rights and Remedies and no other  agreement or  transaction  of whatever  nature
entered into between the Pledgee and the Pledgor at any time shall  preclude any
other exercise of the Pledgee's Rights and Remedies. No waiver by the Pledgee of
any of the Pledgee's  Rights and Remedies on any one occasion  shall be deemed a
waiver on any subsequent  occasion,  nor shall it be deemed a continuing waiver.
All of the  Pledgee's  Rights  and  Remedies  and all of the  Pledgee's  rights,
remedies,  powers,  privileges,  and  discretions  under any other  agreement or
transaction are cumulative and not alternative or exclusive and may be exercised
by the  Pledgee  at such time or times and in such  order of  preference  as the
Pledgee in its sole discretion may determine.

(b) This  Agreement  is  intended  to take  effect as a sealed
instrument,  and it and all transactions thereunder or pursuant thereto shall be
governed as to interpretation,  validity, effect, rights, duties and remedies of
the parties  thereunder  and in all other  respects by the internal  laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

                  (c) This Agreement and all documents which have been or may be
hereinafter furnished by Pledgor to the Pledgee may be reproduced by the Pledgee
by any photographic,  photostatic,  microfilm,  xerographic, or similar process,
and any such reproduction shall be admissible in evidence as the original itself
in any judicial or administrative  proceeding (whether or not the original is in
existence and whether or not such reproduction was made in the regular course of
business).

                  (d) Jurisdiction and Venue.  Borrower  irrevocably  submits to
the non-exclusive  jurisdiction of any federal or state court sitting in Suffolk
County of Massachusetts,  or the County of Los Angeles, California, or at Bank's
discretion  any other court in which the Bank shall  initiate legal or equitable
proceedings and which has jurisdiction  over the parties and any suit, action or
proceeding  arising out of or relating to this Agreement.  Borrower  irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, any
objection it may have or  hereafter  have to the laying of the venue of any such

 CONTINUING GAURANTY OF MARKET MEDIA, INC.

CONTINUING GUARANTY
                               -------------------

         THIS CONTINUING GUARANTY  ("Guaranty"),  dated as of November 25, 1996,
is executed  and  delivered  by Market  Media,  Inc.  ("Guarantor")  in favor of
Foothill Capital Corporation, a California corporation ("Foothill") and in light
of the following:

              FACT ONE: BPI Packaging  Technologies,  Inc. and RC America,  Inc.
(collectively  the  "Borrower")  and Foothill are,  contemporaneously  herewith,
entering into the Loan Documents; and

              FACT  TWO:  In  order  to  induce  Foothill  to  extend  financial
accommodations to Borrower pursuant to the Loan Documents,  and in consideration
thereof,  and in  consideration  of any loans or other financial  accommodations
heretofore or hereafter  extended by Foothill to Borrower,  whether  pursuant to
the  Loan  Documents  or  otherwise,  Guarantor  has  agreed  to  guarantee  the
Guaranteed Obligations.

              FACT  THREE:  Guarantor  is  a  wholly-owned   subsidiary  of  BPI
Packaging  Technologies,  Inc. and has and shall receive direct and  substantial
benefits from the Borrower in consideration of this Guaranty.

              NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  foregoing,  Guarantor
hereby agrees, in favor of Foothill, as follows:

1.   Definitions  and  Construction.  
              (a)  Definitions.  The  following
terms, as used in this Guaranty, shall have the following meanings:

                   "Bankruptcy Code" means The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 (11
U.S.C. Sections 101-1330), as amended or supplemented from time to time, and any
successor  statute,  and any and all rules issued or  promulgated  in connection
therewith.

                   "Guaranteed  Obligations"  means  any  and  all  obligations,
indebtedness,  or  liabilities  of any kind or  character  owed by  Borrower  to
Foothill including all such obligations,  indebtedness, or liabilities,  whether
for principal,  interest  (including any interest which, but for the application
of the provisions of the Bankruptcy  Code,  would have accrued on such amounts),
premium, reimbursement obligations, fees, costs, expenses (including, attorneys'
fees), or indemnity  obligations,  whether  heretofore,  now, or hereafter made,
incurred,  or created,  whether voluntarily or involuntarily made, incurred,  or
created, whether secured or unsecured (and if secured,  regardless of the nature
or extent of the  security),  whether  absolute  or  contingent,  liquidated  or
unliquidated,   determined  or   indeterminate,   whether   Borrower  is  liable
individually  or jointly  with  others,  and whether  recovery  is or  hereafter
becomes barred by any statute of limitations or otherwise becomes  unenforceable
for any reason whatsoever, including any act or failure to act by Foothill.

                   "Loan  Documents"  shall mean that  certain Loan and Security
Agreement, of even date herewith,  between Foothill and Borrower, any promissory
notes  issued  by

-1-

Borrower  in  connection  therewith,  and  those  documents,   instruments,  and
agreements which either now or in the future exist among Borrower, Guarantor, or
any affiliate of Borrower, on the one hand, and Foothill, on the other hand.

              (b)  Construction.  Unless the  context of this  Guaranty  clearly
requires otherwise, references to the plural include the singular, references to
the singular include the plural,  and the term "including" is not limiting.  The
words "hereof," "herein,"  "hereby,"  "hereunder," and other similar terms refer
to  this  Guaranty  as a  whole  and  not to any  particular  provision  of this
Guaranty. Any reference herein to any of the Loan Documents includes any and all
alterations,  amendments,  extensions,  modifications,  renewals, or supplements
thereto or thereof, as applicable.  Neither this Guaranty nor any uncertainty or
ambiguity  herein shall be construed or resolved  against Foothill or Guarantor,
whether  under any rule of  construction  or otherwise.  On the  contrary,  this
Guaranty has been reviewed by Guarantor, Foothill, and their respective counsel,
and shall be construed and interpreted  according to the ordinary meaning of the
words used so as to fairly  accomplish  the purposes and  intentions of Foothill
and Guarantor.

         2.   Guaranteed   Obligations.   Guarantor   hereby   irrevocably   and
unconditionally guarantees to Foothill, as and for its own debt, until final and
indefeasible  payment  thereof  has been made,  (a)  payment  of the  Guaranteed
Obligations,  in each case when and as the same shall  become  due and  payable,
whether  at  maturity,  pursuant  to  a  mandatory  prepayment  requirement,  by
acceleration,  or otherwise;  it being the intent of Guarantor that the guaranty
set  forth  herein  shall  be a  guaranty  of  payment  and  not a  guaranty  of
collection; and (b) the punctual and faithful performance,  keeping, observance,
and fulfillment by Borrower of all of the agreements, conditions, covenants, and
obligations of Borrower contained in the Loan Documents.

         3.   Continuing Guaranty. This Guaranty includes Guaranteed Obligations
arising  under  successive  transactions  continuing,  compromising,  extending,
increasing,  modifying,  releasing,  or  renewing  the  Guaranteed  Obligations,
changing  the  interest  rate,  payment  terms,  or other  terms and  conditions
thereof,  or  creating  new or  additional  Guaranteed  Obligations  after prior
Guaranteed  Obligations  have been satisfied in whole or in part. To the maximum
extent  permitted  by law,  Guarantor  hereby  waives  any right to revoke  this
Guaranty  as  to  future  indebtedness.   If  such  a  revocation  is  effective
notwithstanding the foregoing waiver, Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that (a)
no such  revocation  shall be effective  until written  notice  thereof has been
received by  Foothill,  (b) no such  revocation  shall  apply to any  Guaranteed
Obligations in existence on such date (including,  any subsequent  continuation,
extension, or renewal thereof, or change in the interest rate, payment terms, or
other terms and conditions  thereof),  (c) no such revocation shall apply to any
Guaranteed  Obligations  made or created  after such date to the extent  made or
created pursuant to a legally binding commitment of Foothill in existence on the
date of such  revocation,  (d) no payment by  Guarantor,  Borrower,  or from any
other  source,  prior to the date of such  revocation  shall  reduce the maximum
obligation of Guarantor  hereunder,  and (e) any payment by Borrower or from any
source other than Guarantor,  subsequent to the date of such  revocation,  shall
first be applied to that portion of the  Guaranteed  Obligations as to which the
revocation is effective and which are not, therefore,  guaranteed hereunder, and
to the extent so applied  shall not reduce the maximum  obligation  of Guarantor
hereunder.

-2-

4.   Performance Under This Guaranty.  In the event that Borrower fails
to make any  payment  of any  Guaranteed  Obligations  on or before the due date
thereof,  or if Borrower shall fail to perform,  keep,  observe,  or fulfill any
other  obligation  referred  to in clause  (b) of Section 2 hereof in the manner
provided in the Loan Documents,  Guarantor  immediately shall cause such payment
to be made or each of such  obligations  to be  performed,  kept,  observed,  or
fulfilled.

         5.  Primary  Obligations.  This  Guaranty  is a  primary  and  original
obligation  of Guarantor,  is not merely the creation of a surety  relationship,
and is an  absolute,  unconditional,  and  continuing  guaranty  of payment  and
performance  which  shall  remain in full  force and effect  without  respect to
future changes in  conditions,  including any change of law or any invalidity or
irregularity  with respect to the issuance of any  promissory  notes.  Guarantor
agrees that it is directly,  jointly and severally  with any other  guarantor of
the  Guaranteed  Obligations,  liable  to  Foothill,  that  the  obligations  of
Guarantor  hereunder are independent of the obligations of Borrower or any other
guarantor,  and that a separate action may be brought against  Guarantor whether
such  action is  brought  against  Borrower  or any other  guarantor  or whether
Borrower or any such other guarantor is joined in such action.  Guarantor agrees
that its liability hereunder shall be immediate and shall not be contingent upon
the exercise or enforcement by Foothill of whatever remedies it may have against
Borrower or any other  guarantor,  or the enforcement of any lien or realization
upon any security  Foothill may at any time possess.  Guarantor  agrees that any
release which may be given by Foothill to Borrower or any other  guarantor shall
not release  Guarantor.  Guarantor  consents and agrees that  Foothill  shall be
under no obligation to marshal any assets of Borrower or any other  guarantor in
favor of  Guarantor,  or against  or in payment of any or all of the  Guaranteed
Obligations.

         6. Waivers.

              (a) To the  maximum  extent  permitted  by law,  Guarantor  hereby
waives:  (1)  notice  of  acceptance  hereof;  (2)  notice of any loans or other
financial  accommodations  made or  extended  under  the Loan  Documents  or the
creation or existence of any Guaranteed Obligations; (3) notice of the amount of
the Guaranteed  Obligations,  subject,  however,  to  Guarantor's  right to make
inquiry of Foothill to ascertain the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations at any
reasonable time; (4) notice of any adverse change in the financial  condition of
Borrower or of any other fact that might increase  Guarantor's  risk  hereunder;
(5) notice of presentment for payment, demand, protest, and notice thereof as to
any promissory notes or other instruments  among the Loan Documents;  (6) notice
of any breach, default or Event of Default under the Loan Documents; and (7) all
other  notices  (except if such notice is  specifically  required to be given to
Guarantor  hereunder or under any Loan  Document to which  Guarantor is a party)
and demands to which Guarantor might otherwise be entitled.

              (b) To the  maximum  extent  permitted  by law,  Guarantor  hereby
waives any right Guarantor may have by statute or otherwise to require  Foothill
to institute  suit against  Borrower or to exhaust any rights and remedies which
Foothill has or may have against Borrower. In this regard, Guarantor agrees that
it is bound to the payment of all Guaranteed  Obligations,  whether now existing
or hereafter accruing, as fully as if such Guaranteed  Obligations were directly
owing to Foothill by Guarantor.  Guarantor further waives any defense arising by
reason of any  disability  or other 

-3-

defense (other than the defense that the Guaranteed  Obligations shall have been
fully and finally  performed and indefeasibly  paid) of Borrower or by reason of
the cessation from any cause  whatsoever of the liability of Borrower in respect
thereof.

              (c) To the  maximum  extent  permitted  by law,  Guarantor  hereby
waives:  (1) any  rights  to  assert  against  Foothill  any  defense  (legal or
equitable),  set-off,  counterclaim,  or claim which Guarantor may now or at any
time hereafter have against Borrower or any other party liable to Foothill;  (2)
any defense,  set-off,  counterclaim,  or claim, of any kind or nature,  arising
directly  or  indirectly   from  the  present  or  future  lack  of  perfection,
sufficiency,  validity,  or enforceability of the Guaranteed  Obligations or any
security  therefor;  (3) any  defense  arising by reason of any claim or defense
based upon an election of remedies by  Foothill;  (4) the benefit of any statute
of limitations  affecting  Guarantor's  liability  hereunder or the  enforcement
thereof,  and any act which shall defer or delay the operation of any statute of
limitations  applicable to the Guaranteed Obligations shall similarly operate to
defer or delay the  operation  of such  statute  of  limitations  applicable  to
Guarantor's liability hereunder.

              (d) To the  maximum  extent  permitted  by law,  Guarantor  hereby
waives any right of  subrogation  Guarantor has or may have as against  Borrower
with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations. In addition, Guarantor hereby waives
any right to proceed  against  Borrower,  now or  hereafter,  for  contribution,
indemnity,  reimbursement,  and any other suretyship rights and claims,  whether
direct or indirect,  liquidated or contingent,  whether arising under express or
implied  contract  or by  operation  of law,  which  Guarantor  may now  have or
hereafter   have  as  against  the  Borrower  with  respect  to  the  Guaranteed
Obligations.  Guarantor  also  hereby  waives any rights to  recourse to or with
respect  to any  asset  of  Borrower.  Guarantor  agrees  that in  light  of the
immediately  foregoing  waivers,  the  execution of this  Guaranty  shall not be
deemed to make  Guarantor a  "creditor"  of  Borrower,  and that for purposes of
Sections  547 and 550 of the  Bankruptcy  Code  Guarantor  shall not be deemed a
"creditor" of Borrower.

         7. Releases.  Guarantor  consents and agrees that, without notice to or
by Guarantor  and without  affecting or impairing the  obligations  of Guarantor
hereunder, Foothill may, by action or inaction:

                           (a)  compromise,  settle,  extend the duration or the
                     time for the payment of, or discharge the  performance  of,
                     or  may  refuse  to  or  otherwise  not  enforce  the  Loan
                     Documents;

                           (b) release all or any one or more parties to any one
                     or more of the Loan Documents or grant other indulgences to
                     Borrower in respect thereof;

                           (c) amend or modify in any manner and at any time (or
                     from time to time) any of the Loan Documents; or

                           (d) release or  substitute  any other  guarantor,  if
                     any, of the Guaranteed Obligations,  or enforce,  exchange,
                     release,   or  waive  any  security   for  the   Guaranteed
                     Obligations  (including,  the  collateral  referred  to  in
                     Section 18 hereof) or any other  guaranty of the 

-4-

Guaranteed Obligations, or any portion thereof.

8. No Election.  Foothill shall have the right to seek recourse against
Guarantor to the fullest extent provided for herein, and no election by Foothill
to proceed in one form of action or proceeding,  or against any party, or on any
obligation,  shall  constitute  a waiver of  Foothill's  right to proceed in any
other form of action or proceeding or against other parties unless  Foothill has
expressly waived such right in writing.  Specifically,  but without limiting the
generality  of the  foregoing,  no action or  proceeding  by Foothill  under any
document or instrument  evidencing  the  Guaranteed  Obligations  shall serve to
diminish the  liability of Guarantor  under this  Guaranty  except to the extent
that  Foothill  finally and  unconditionally  shall have  realized  indefeasible
payment by such action or proceeding.

         9.  Indefeasible  Payment.  The  Guaranteed  Obligations  shall  not be
considered  indefeasibly paid for purposes of this Guaranty unless and until all
payments  to  Foothill  are no  longer  subject  to any right on the part of any
person, including Borrower,  Borrower as a debtor in possession,  or any trustee
(whether  appointed under the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) of Borrower's assets
to invalidate or set aside such payments or to seek to recoup the amount of such
payments  or any  portion  thereof,  or to  declare  same  to be  fraudulent  or
preferential.  Upon such full and final performance and indefeasible  payment of
the Guaranteed Obligations whether by Guarantor or Borrower, Foothill shall have
no  obligation  whatsoever  to  transfer  or  assign  its  interest  in the Loan
Documents to Guarantor.  In the event that, for any reason,  any portion of such
payments  to  Foothill  is  set  aside  or  restored,   whether  voluntarily  or
involuntarily,  after the making  thereof,  then the  obligation  intended to be
satisfied  thereby shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if
said payment or payments had not been made,  and  Guarantor  shall be liable for
the full  amount  Foothill  is  required  to repay  plus any and all  costs  and
expenses (including attorneys' fees) paid by Foothill in connection therewith.

         10. Financial Condition of Borrower.  Guarantor represents and warrants
to Foothill that Guarantor is currently  informed of the financial  condition of
Borrower and of all other  circumstances  which a diligent  inquiry would reveal
and  which  bear  upon the risk of  nonpayment  of the  Guaranteed  Obligations.
Guarantor  further  represents  and warrants to Foothill that Guarantor has read
and understands the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents. Guarantor hereby
covenants that Guarantor will continue to keep informed of Borrower's  financial
condition, the financial condition of other guarantors, if any, and of all other
circumstances  which bear upon the risk of nonpayment or  nonperformance  of the
Guaranteed Obligations.

         11. Subordination. Guarantor hereby agrees that any and all present and
future  indebtedness of Borrower owing to Guarantor is postponed in favor of and
subordinated  to payment,  in full, in cash, of the Guaranteed  Obligations.  In
this  regard,  no payment of any kind  whatsoever  shall be made with respect to
such indebtedness  until the Guaranteed  Obligations have been indefeasibly paid
in full.

         12.  Payments;  Application.  All  payments  to be  made  hereunder  by
Guarantor  shall be made in lawful money of the United  States of America at the
time of payment, shall be made in immediately available funds, and shall be made
without 

-5-

deduction  (whether for taxes or  otherwise)  or offset.  All  payments  made by
Guarantor  hereunder  shall be  applied  as  follows:  first,  to all  costs and
expenses  (including  attorneys'  fees)  incurred by Foothill in enforcing  this
Guaranty or in collecting the Guaranteed Obligations; second, to all accrued and
unpaid  interest,  premium,  if any,  and fees  owing to  Foothill  constituting
Guaranteed Obligations; and third, to the balance of the Guaranteed Obligations.

         13. Attorneys' Fees and Costs.  Guarantor agrees to pay, on demand, all
reasonable  attorneys'  fees and all  other  costs  and  expenses  which  may be
incurred by Foothill in the  enforcement  of this Guaranty or in any way arising
out of, or  consequential  to the protection,  assertion,  or enforcement of the
Guaranteed  Obligations  (or any  security  therefor),  whether  or not  suit is
brought.

         14.  Indemnification.  Guarantor agrees to indemnify  Foothill and hold
Foothill harmless against all obligations,  demands, or liabilities  asserted by
any party and  against  all  losses in any way  suffered,  incurred,  or paid by
Foothill  as  a  result  of  or  in  any  way  arising  out  of,  following,  or
consequential  to  Foothill's  transactions  with  Borrower,  other than  losses
arising  primarily  from the  gross  negligence  or  intentional  misconduct  of
Foothill.

         15.  Notices.  All notices or demands by  Guarantor  or Foothill to the
other relating to this Guaranty shall be in writing and either personally served
or sent by  registered  or  certified  mail,  postage  prepaid,  return  receipt
requested, or by prepaid telex, telefacsimile,  or telegram, and shall be deemed
to be given  received on the  earlier of actual  receipt or three (3) days after
the deposit of such notice in the mail.  Unless otherwise  specified in a notice
sent or  delivered in  accordance  with the  provisions  of this  section,  such
writing  shall  be  sent,  if to  Guarantor,  then to the  attention  of  Dennis
Caulfield at Guarantor's  address set forth on the signature page hereof, and if
to Foothill, then as follows:

                           Attn: Business Finance Division Manager

         16.  Cumulative  Remedies.  No remedy under this  Guaranty or under any
Loan  Document is intended to be  exclusive  of any other  remedy,  but each and
every remedy shall be  cumulative  and in addition to any and every other remedy
given  hereunder  or under any Loan  Document,  and those  provided by law or in
equity.  No delay or  omission  by  Foothill  to  exercise  any right under this
Guaranty shall impair any such right nor be construed to be a waiver thereof. No
failure on the part of Foothill to  exercise,  and no delay in  exercising,  any
right  hereunder  shall  operate  as a waiver  thereof;  nor shall any single or
partial  exercise of any right hereunder  preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right.

         17.  Books and  Records.  Guarantor  agrees that  Foothill's  books and
records showing the account between Foothill and Borrower shall be admissible in
any action or proceeding  and shall be binding upon Guarantor for the purpose of
establishing  the items therein set forth and shall constitute prima facie proof

-6-

thereof.

         18. Severability of Provisions. Any provision of this Guaranty which is
prohibited or  unenforceable  under  applicable law, shall be ineffective to the
extent  of  such  prohibition  or  unenforceability   without  invalidating  the
remaining provisions hereof.

         19. Entire Agreement;  Amendments. This Guaranty constitutes the entire
agreement  between  Guarantor  and  Foothill  pertaining  to the subject  matter
contained herein. This Guaranty may not be altered,  amended,  or modified,  nor
may any  provision  hereof be waived or  noncompliance  therewith  consented to,
except by means of a writing  executed by both Guarantor and Foothill.  Any such
alteration, amendment,  modification, waiver, or consent shall be effective only
to the extent specified therein and for the specific purpose for which given. No
course of  dealing  and no delay or waiver of any right or  default  under  this
Guaranty shall be deemed a waiver of any other,  similar or dissimilar  right or
default or otherwise prejudice the rights and remedies hereunder.

         20.  Successors and Assigns.  The  dissolution  of Guarantor  shall not
terminate  this  Guaranty.  This  Guaranty  shall be  binding  upon  Guarantor's
representatives,  successors,  and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the
successors  and assigns of  Foothill;  provided,  however,  Guarantor  shall not
assign this Guaranty or delegate any of its duties hereunder without  Foothill's
prior written consent.  Any assignment  without the consent of Foothill shall be
absolutely  void. In the event of any  assignment or other transfer of rights by
Foothill,   the  rights  and  benefits  herein  conferred  upon  Foothill  shall
automatically extend to and be vested in such assignee or other transferee.

         21.  Choice  of Law and  Venue.  THE  VALIDITY  OF THIS  GUARANTY,  ITS
CONSTRUCTION,  INTERPRETATION,  AND ENFORCEMENT, AND THE RIGHTS OF GUARANTOR AND
FOOTHILL,  SHALL BE DETERMINED  UNDER,  GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF  MASSACHUSETTS,  WITHOUT REGARD TO
PRINCIPLES  OF  CONFLICTS  OF  LAW.  TO THE  MAXIMUM  EXTENT  PERMITTED  BY LAW,
GUARANTOR  HEREBY AGREES THAT ALL ACTIONS OR  PROCEEDINGS  ARISING IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE TRIED AND  DETERMINED  ONLY IN THE STATE AND FEDERAL
COURTS  LOCATED IN SUFFOLK  COUNTY,  MASSACHUSETTS,  THE COUNTY OF LOS  ANGELES,

FOOTHILL  SHALL  INITIATE   LEGAL  OR  EQUITABLE   PROCEEDINGS   AND  WHICH  HAS
JURISDICTION  OVER THE PARTIES AND MATTER IN CONTROVERSY.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW,  GUARANTOR  HEREBY  EXPRESSLY  WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO
ASSERT THE DOCTRINE OF FORUM NON  CONVENIENS OR TO OBJECT TO VENUE TO THE EXTENT

CAUSE OF ACTION,  CLAIM,  DEMAND, OR PROCEEDING ARISING UNDER OR WITH RESPECT TO

 CONTINUING GAURANTY OF BPI (U.K.)

CONTINUING GUARANTY
                               -------------------

THIS CONTINUING GUARANTY  ("Guaranty"),  dated as of November 25, 1996,
is executed and delivered by BPI Packaging (UK) Limited  ("Guarantor")  in favor
of Foothill Capital Corporation,  a California  corporation  ("Foothill") and in
light of the following:

                  FACT ONE:  BPI  Packaging  Technologies,  Inc. and RC America,
Inc.  (collectively,   the  "Borrower")  and  Foothill  are,   contemporaneously
herewith, entering into the Loan Documents; and

                  FACT TWO:  In order to  induce  Foothill  to extend  financial
accommodations to Borrower pursuant to the Loan Documents,  and in consideration
thereof,  and in  consideration  of any loans or other financial  accommodations
heretofore or hereafter  extended by Foothill to Borrower,  whether  pursuant to
the  Loan  Documents  or  otherwise,  Guarantor  has  agreed  to  guarantee  the
Guaranteed Obligations.

                  NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration of the foregoing,  Guarantor
hereby agrees, in favor of Foothill, as follows:

1.       Definitions and Construction.
                  (a)  Definitions.   The  following  terms,  as  used  in  this
Guaranty, shall have the following meanings:

                           "Bankruptcy  Code" means The Bankruptcy Reform Act of
1978 (11 U.S.C.  Sections  101-1330),  as amended or  supplemented  from time to
time, and any successor statute,  and any and all rules issued or promulgated in
connection therewith.

                           "Guaranteed    Obligations"   means   any   and   all
obligations,  indebtedness,  or  liabilities  of any kind or  character  owed by
Borrower  to  Foothill   including  all  such  obligations,   indebtedness,   or
liabilities,  whether for principal, interest (including any interest which, but
for the application of the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, would have accrued
on such amounts),  premium,  reimbursement  obligations,  fees, costs,  expenses
(including, attorneys' fees), or indemnity obligations, whether heretofore, now,
or hereafter made,  incurred,  or created,  whether voluntarily or involuntarily
made,  incurred,  or  created,  whether  secured or  unsecured  (and if secured,
regardless  of the  nature or  extent  of the  security),  whether  absolute  or
contingent,  liquidated or unliquidated,  determined or  indeterminate,  whether
Borrower is liable  individually or jointly with others, and whether recovery is
or hereafter  becomes barred by any statute of limitations or otherwise  becomes
unenforceable for any reason whatsoever,  including any act or failure to act by
Foothill.

                           "Loan  Documents"  shall mean that  certain  Loan and
Security Agreement,  of even date herewith,  between Foothill and Borrower,  any
promissory  notes  issued  by  Borrower  in  connection  therewith,   and  those
documents,  instruments,  and agreements which either now or in the future exist
among Borrower,  Guarantor,  or any affiliate of Borrower,  on the one hand, and
Foothill, on the other hand.

                  (b) Construction.  Unless the context of this Guaranty clearly

-1-

requires otherwise, references to the plural include the singular, references to
the singular include the plural,  and the term "including" is not limiting.  The
words "hereof," "herein,"  "hereby,"  "hereunder," and other similar terms refer
to  this  Guaranty  as a  whole  and  not to any  particular  provision  of this
Guaranty. Any reference herein to any of the Loan Documents includes any and all
alterations,  amendments,  extensions,  modifications,  renewals, or supplements
thereto or thereof, as applicable.  Neither this Guaranty nor any uncertainty or
ambiguity  herein shall be construed or resolved  against Foothill or Guarantor,
whether  under any rule of  construction  or otherwise.  On the  contrary,  this
Guaranty has been reviewed by Guarantor, Foothill, and their respective counsel,
and shall be construed and interpreted  according to the ordinary meaning of the
words used so as to fairly  accomplish  the purposes and  intentions of Foothill
and Guarantor.

                  2. Guaranteed  Obligations.  Guarantor hereby  irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantees to Foothill, as and for its own debt, until final and
indefeasible  payment  thereof  has been made,  (a)  payment  of the  Guaranteed
Obligations,  in each case when and as the same shall  become  due and  payable,
whether  at  maturity,  pursuant  to  a  mandatory  prepayment  requirement,  by
acceleration,  or otherwise;  it being the intent of Guarantor that the guaranty
set  forth  herein  shall  be a  guaranty  of  payment  and  not a  guaranty  of
collection; and (b) the punctual and faithful performance,  keeping, observance,
and fulfillment by Borrower of all of the agreements, conditions, covenants, and
obligations of Borrower contained in the Loan Documents.

                  3.  Continuing  Guaranty.  This Guaranty  includes  Guaranteed
Obligations  arising under  successive  transactions  continuing,  compromising,
extending,   increasing,   modifying,  releasing,  or  renewing  the  Guaranteed
Obligations,  changing  the interest  rate,  payment  terms,  or other terms and
conditions thereof, or creating new or additional  Guaranteed  Obligations after
prior  Guaranteed  Obligations  have been  satisfied in whole or in part. To the
maximum  extent  permitted by law,  Guarantor  hereby waives any right to revoke
this  Guaranty as to future  indebtedness.  If such a  revocation  is  effective
notwithstanding the foregoing waiver, Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that (a)
no such  revocation  shall be effective  until written  notice  thereof has been
received by  Foothill,  (b) no such  revocation  shall  apply to any  Guaranteed
Obligations in existence on such date (including,  any subsequent  continuation,
extension, or renewal thereof, or change in the interest rate, payment terms, or
other terms and conditions  thereof),  (c) no such revocation shall apply to any
Guaranteed  Obligations  made or created  after such date to the extent  made or
created pursuant to a legally binding commitment of Foothill in existence on the
date of such  revocation,  (d) no payment by  Guarantor,  Borrower,  or from any
other  source,  prior to the date of such  revocation  shall  reduce the maximum
obligation of Guarantor  hereunder,  and (e) any payment by Borrower or from any
source other than Guarantor,  subsequent to the date of such  revocation,  shall
first be applied to that portion of the  Guaranteed  Obligations as to which the
revocation is effective and which are not, therefore,  guaranteed hereunder, and
to the extent so applied  shall not reduce the maximum  obligation  of Guarantor
hereunder.

                  4. Performance Under This Guaranty. In the event that Borrower
fails to make any  payment of any  Guaranteed  Obligations  on or before the due
date thereof,  or if Borrower shall fail to perform,  keep,  observe, or fulfill
any other obligation referred to in clause (b) of Section 2 hereof in the manner
provided in the Loan Documents,  

-2-

Guarantor  immediately  shall  cause  such  payment  to be  made or each of such
obligations to be performed, kept, observed, or fulfilled.

                  5.  Primary  Obligations.  This  Guaranty  is  a  primary  and
original  obligation  of  Guarantor,  is not  merely  the  creation  of a surety
relationship,  and is an absolute,  unconditional,  and  continuing  guaranty of
payment  and  performance  which shall  remain in full force and effect  without
respect to future  changes  in  conditions,  including  any change of law or any
invalidity or irregularity with respect to the issuance of any promissory notes.
Guarantor  agrees  that it is  directly,  jointly and  severally  with any other
guarantor  of  the  Guaranteed   Obligations,   liable  to  Foothill,  that  the
obligations  of  Guarantor  hereunder  are  independent  of the  obligations  of
Borrower  or any other  guarantor,  and that a  separate  action  may be brought
against  Guarantor  whether such action is brought against Borrower or any other
guarantor  or whether  Borrower  or any such other  guarantor  is joined in such
action.  Guarantor  agrees that its liability  hereunder  shall be immediate and
shall not be contingent upon the exercise or enforcement by Foothill of whatever
remedies it may have against Borrower or any other guarantor, or the enforcement
of any lien or realization  upon any security  Foothill may at any time possess.
Guarantor  agrees that any release which may be given by Foothill to Borrower or
any other guarantor shall not release  Guarantor.  Guarantor consents and agrees
that Foothill  shall be under no obligation to marshal any assets of Borrower or
any other  guarantor in favor of  Guarantor,  or against or in payment of any or
all of the Guaranteed Obligations.

                  6. Waivers.

                  (a) To the maximum extent  permitted by law,  Guarantor hereby
waives:  (1)  notice  of  acceptance  hereof;  (2)  notice of any loans or other
financial  accommodations  made or  extended  under  the Loan  Documents  or the
creation or existence of any Guaranteed Obligations; (3) notice of the amount of
the Guaranteed  Obligations,  subject,  however,  to  Guarantor's  right to make
inquiry of Foothill to ascertain the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations at any
reasonable time; (4) notice of any adverse change in the financial  condition of
Borrower or of any other fact that might increase  Guarantor's  risk  hereunder;
(5) notice of presentment for payment, demand, protest, and notice thereof as to
any promissory notes or other instruments  among the Loan Documents;  (6) notice
of any breach, default or Event of Default under the Loan Documents; and (7) all
other  notices  (except if such notice is  specifically  required to be given to
Guarantor  hereunder or under any Loan  Document to which  Guarantor is a party)
and demands to which Guarantor might otherwise be entitled.

                  (b) To the maximum extent  permitted by law,  Guarantor hereby
waives any right Guarantor may have by statute or otherwise to require  Foothill
to institute  suit against  Borrower or to exhaust any rights and remedies which
Foothill has or may have against Borrower. In this regard, Guarantor agrees that
it is bound to the payment of all Guaranteed  Obligations,  whether now existing
or hereafter accruing, as fully as if such Guaranteed  Obligations were directly
owing to Foothill by Guarantor.  Guarantor further waives any defense arising by
reason of any  disability  or other  defense  (other than the  defense  that the
Guaranteed   Obligations  shall  have  been  fully  and  finally  performed  and
indefeasibly  paid) of  Borrower  or by reason of the  cessation  from any cause
whatsoever of the liability of Borrower in respect thereof.

-3-

(c) To the maximum extent  permitted by law,  Guarantor hereby
waives:  (1) any  rights  to  assert  against  Foothill  any  defense  (legal or
equitable),  set-off,  counterclaim,  or claim which Guarantor may now or at any
time hereafter have against Borrower or any other party liable to Foothill;  (2)
any defense,  set-off,  counterclaim,  or claim, of any kind or nature,  arising
directly  or  indirectly   from  the  present  or  future  lack  of  perfection,
sufficiency,  validity,  or enforceability of the Guaranteed  Obligations or any
security  therefor;  (3) any  defense  arising by reason of any claim or defense
based upon an election of remedies by  Foothill;  (4) the benefit of any statute
of limitations  affecting  Guarantor's  liability  hereunder or the  enforcement
thereof,  and any act which shall defer or delay the operation of any statute of
limitations  applicable to the Guaranteed Obligations shall similarly operate to
defer or delay the  operation  of such  statute  of  limitations  applicable  to
Guarantor's liability hereunder.

                  (d) To the maximum extent  permitted by law,  Guarantor hereby
waives any right of  subrogation  Guarantor has or may have as against  Borrower
with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations. In addition, Guarantor hereby waives
any right to proceed  against  Borrower,  now or  hereafter,  for  contribution,
indemnity,  reimbursement,  and any other suretyship rights and claims,  whether
direct or indirect,  liquidated or contingent,  whether arising under express or
implied  contract  or by  operation  of law,  which  Guarantor  may now  have or
hereafter   have  as  against  the  Borrower  with  respect  to  the  Guaranteed
Obligations.  Guarantor  also  hereby  waives any rights to  recourse to or with
respect  to any  asset  of  Borrower.  Guarantor  agrees  that in  light  of the
immediately  foregoing  waivers,  the  execution of this  Guaranty  shall not be
deemed to make  Guarantor a  "creditor"  of  Borrower,  and that for purposes of
Sections  547 and 550 of the  Bankruptcy  Code  Guarantor  shall not be deemed a
"creditor" of Borrower.

                  7.  Releases.  Guarantor  consents  and agrees  that,  without
notice to or by Guarantor and without  affecting or impairing the obligations of
Guarantor hereunder, Foothill may, by action or inaction:

                           (a)  compromise,  settle,  extend the duration or the
                     time for the payment of, or discharge the  performance  of,
                     or  may  refuse  to  or  otherwise  not  enforce  the  Loan
                     Documents;

                           (b) release all or any one or more parties to any one
                     or more of the Loan Documents or grant other indulgences to
                     Borrower in respect thereof;

                           (c) amend or modify in any manner and at any time (or
                     from time to time) any of the Loan Documents; or

                           (d) release or  substitute  any other  guarantor,  if
                     any, of the Guaranteed Obligations,  or enforce,  exchange,
                     release,   or  waive  any  security   for  the   Guaranteed
                     Obligations  (including,  the  collateral  referred  to  in
                     Section 18 hereof) or any other  guaranty of the Guaranteed
                     Obligations, or any portion thereof.

8. No Election. Foothill shall have the right to seek recourse
against 

-4-

Guarantor to the fullest extent provided for herein, and no election by Foothill
to proceed in one form of action or proceeding,  or against any party, or on any
obligation,  shall  constitute  a waiver of  Foothill's  right to proceed in any
other form of action or proceeding or against other parties unless  Foothill has
expressly waived such right in writing.  Specifically,  but without limiting the
generality  of the  foregoing,  no action or  proceeding  by Foothill  under any
document or instrument  evidencing  the  Guaranteed  Obligations  shall serve to
diminish the  liability of Guarantor  under this  Guaranty  except to the extent
that  Foothill  finally and  unconditionally  shall have  realized  indefeasible
payment by such action or proceeding.

                  9. Indefeasible Payment. The Guaranteed  Obligations shall not
be considered  indefeasibly  paid for purposes of this Guaranty unless and until
all payments to Foothill  are no longer  subject to any right on the part of any
person, including Borrower,  Borrower as a debtor in possession,  or any trustee
(whether  appointed under the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) of Borrower's assets
to invalidate or set aside such payments or to seek to recoup the amount of such
payments  or any  portion  thereof,  or to  declare  same  to be  fraudulent  or
preferential.  Upon such full and final performance and indefeasible  payment of
the Guaranteed Obligations whether by Guarantor or Borrower, Foothill shall have
no  obligation  whatsoever  to  transfer  or  assign  its  interest  in the Loan
Documents to Guarantor.  In the event that, for any reason,  any portion of such
payments  to  Foothill  is  set  aside  or  restored,   whether  voluntarily  or
involuntarily,  after the making  thereof,  then the  obligation  intended to be
satisfied  thereby shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if
said payment or payments had not been made,  and  Guarantor  shall be liable for
the full  amount  Foothill  is  required  to repay  plus any and all  costs  and
expenses (including attorneys' fees) paid by Foothill in connection therewith.

                  10. Financial Condition of Borrower.  Guarantor represents and
warrants to Foothill  that  Guarantor  is  currently  informed of the  financial
condition of Borrower and of all other  circumstances  which a diligent  inquiry
would  reveal  and which  bear  upon the risk of  nonpayment  of the  Guaranteed
Obligations.   Guarantor  further  represents  and  warrants  to  Foothill  that
Guarantor  has  read  and  understands  the  terms  and  conditions  of the Loan
Documents.  Guarantor  hereby  covenants  that  Guarantor  will continue to keep
informed of Borrower's  financial  condition,  the financial  condition of other
guarantors,  if any, and of all other  circumstances which bear upon the risk of
nonpayment or nonperformance of the Guaranteed Obligations.

                  11.  Subordination.  Guarantor  hereby agrees that any and all
present and future  indebtedness  of Borrower owing to Guarantor is postponed in
favor of and  subordinated  to  payment,  in full,  in cash,  of the  Guaranteed
Obligations.  In this regard,  no payment of any kind  whatsoever  shall be made
with respect to such  indebtedness  until the Guaranteed  Obligations  have been
indefeasibly paid in full.

                  12. Payments;  Application.  All payments to be made hereunder
by Guarantor  shall be made in lawful  money of the United  States of America at
the time of payment,  shall be made in immediately available funds, and shall be
made without deduction  (whether for taxes or otherwise) or offset. All payments
made by Guarantor hereunder shall be applied as follows: first, to all costs and
expenses  (including  attorneys'  fees)  incurred by Foothill in enforcing  this
Guaranty or in collecting the Guaranteed Obligations; second, to all accrued and
unpaid  interest,  premium,  if any,  

-6-

and fees owing to Foothill constituting  Guaranteed  Obligations;  and third, to
the balance of the Guaranteed Obligations.

                  13.  Attorneys'  Fees and Costs.  Guarantor  agrees to pay, on
demand,  all reasonable  attorneys'  fees and all other costs and expenses which
may be incurred by Foothill in the  enforcement  of this  Guaranty or in any way
arising out of, or consequential to the protection, assertion, or enforcement of
the Guaranteed  Obligations (or any security  therefor),  whether or not suit is
brought.

                  14.  Indemnification.  Guarantor agrees to indemnify  Foothill
and hold Foothill  harmless  against all  obligations,  demands,  or liabilities
asserted by any party and against all losses in any way suffered,  incurred,  or
paid by  Foothill as a result of or in any way  arising  out of,  following,  or
consequential  to  Foothill's  transactions  with  Borrower,  other than  losses
arising  primarily  from the  gross  negligence  or  intentional  misconduct  of
Foothill.

                  15.  Notices.  All notices or demands by Guarantor or Foothill
to the other relating to this Guaranty shall be in writing and either personally
served or sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid,  return receipt
requested, or by prepaid telex, telefacsimile,  or telegram, and shall be deemed
to be given  received on the  earlier of actual  receipt or three (3) days after
the deposit of such notice in the mail.  Unless otherwise  specified in a notice
sent or  delivered in  accordance  with the  provisions  of this  section,  such
writing  shall  be  sent,  if to  Guarantor,  then to the  attention  of  Dennis
Caulfield at Guarantor's  address set forth on the signature page hereof, and if
to Foothill, then as follows:

                              Foothill Capital Corporation

                              Attn: Business Finance Division Manager

                  16.  Cumulative  Remedies.  No remedy  under this  Guaranty or
under any Loan  Document is intended to be  exclusive of any other  remedy,  but
each and every remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any and every other
remedy given hereunder or under any Loan Document,  and those provided by law or
in equity.  No delay or omission  by  Foothill to exercise  any right under this
Guaranty shall impair any such right nor be construed to be a waiver thereof. No
failure on the part of Foothill to  exercise,  and no delay in  exercising,  any
right  hereunder  shall  operate  as a waiver  thereof;  nor shall any single or
partial  exercise of any right hereunder  preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right.

                  17. Books and Records.  Guarantor agrees that Foothill's books
and  records  showing  the  account  between  Foothill  and  Borrower  shall  be
admissible in any action or proceeding  and shall be binding upon  Guarantor for
the purpose of  establishing  the items  therein set forth and shall  constitute
prima facie proof thereof.

                  18. Severability of Provisions. Any provision of this Guaranty
which is prohibited or unenforceable  under applicable law, shall be ineffective
to the extent of 

-6-

such  prohibition  or  unenforceability   without   invalidating  the  remaining
provisions hereof.

                  19. Entire Agreement;  Amendments.  This Guaranty  constitutes
the entire agreement  between  Guarantor and Foothill  pertaining to the subject
matter contained herein. This Guaranty may not be altered, amended, or modified,
nor may any provision hereof be waived or noncompliance  therewith consented to,
except by means of a writing  executed by both Guarantor and Foothill.  Any such
alteration, amendment,  modification, waiver, or consent shall be effective only
to the extent specified therein and for the specific purpose for which given. No
course of  dealing  and no delay or waiver of any right or  default  under  this
Guaranty shall be deemed a waiver of any other,  similar or dissimilar  right or
default or otherwise prejudice the rights and remedies hereunder.

                  20. Successors and Assigns. The dissolution of Guarantor shall
not terminate  this Guaranty.  This Guaranty  shall be binding upon  Guarantor's
representatives,  successors,  and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the
successors  and assigns of  Foothill;  provided,  however,  Guarantor  shall not
assign this Guaranty or delegate any of its duties hereunder without  Foothill's
prior written consent.  Any assignment  without the consent of Foothill shall be
absolutely  void. In the event of any  assignment or other transfer of rights by
Foothill,   the  rights  and  benefits  herein  conferred  upon  Foothill  shall
automatically extend to and be vested in such assignee or other transferee.

                  21.  Choice of Law and Venue.  THE VALIDITY OF THIS  GUARANTY,
ITS CONSTRUCTION,  INTERPRETATION,  AND ENFORCEMENT, AND THE RIGHTS OF GUARANTOR
AND  FOOTHILL,  SHALL  BE  DETERMINED  UNDER,  GOVERNED  BY,  AND  CONSTRUED  IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS,  WITHOUT
REGARD TO  PRINCIPLES  OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. TO THE MAXIMUM  EXTENT  PERMITTED BY
LAW,  GUARANTOR  HEREBY  AGREES  THAT ALL  ACTIONS  OR  PROCEEDINGS  ARISING  IN
CONNECTION  WITH THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE TRIED AND  DETERMINED  ONLY IN THE STATE
AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN SUFFOLK COUNTY,  MASSACHUSETTS,  THE COUNTY OF LOS
ANGELES,  CALIFORNIA,  OR, AT THE SOLE OPTION OF FOOTHILL, IN ANY OTHER COURT IN
WHICH  FOOTHILL  SHALL  INITIATE  LEGAL OR EQUITABLE  PROCEEDINGS  AND WHICH HAS
JURISDICTION  OVER THE PARTIES AND MATTER IN CONTROVERSY.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW,  GUARANTOR  HEREBY  EXPRESSLY  WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO
ASSERT THE DOCTRINE OF FORUM NON  CONVENIENS OR TO OBJECT TO VENUE TO THE EXTENT
ANY PROCEEDING IS BROUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION.

                  22. Waiver of Jury Trial.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT  PERMITTED BY
LAW, GUARANTOR HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY ACTION,
CAUSE OF ACTION,  CLAIM,  DEMAND, OR PROCEEDING ARISING UNDER OR WITH RESPECT TO
THIS GUARANTY,  OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED  WITH,  RELATED TO, OR INCIDENTAL TO THE

         All  words  and  terms  used  in  this   Agreement   other  than  those
specifically  defined  herein  shall have the  meanings  accorded to them in the
Massachusetts Uniform Commercial Code (General Law, Chapter 106) as amended from
time to time (herein the "Code").

3.  Ordinary Course of Business. The Bank hereby authorizes and permits
the  Borrower  to hold,  process,  sell,  use or consume in the  manufacture  or
processing  of finished  goods,  or otherwise  dispose of the Inventory for fair
consideration, all in the ordinary course of the Borrower's business, excluding,
without limitation, sales to creditors or in bulk or sales or other dispositions
occurring under  circumstances  which would or could create any lien or interest
adverse to the Bank's security interest or other right hereunder in the proceeds
resulting therefrom. The Bank also hereby authorizes and permits the Borrower to
receive  from the Debtors all amounts due as proceeds of the  Collateral  at the
Borrower's  own cost and expense,  and also  liability,  if any,  subject to the
direction  and  control of the Bank at all times;  and the Bank may at any time,
without cause or notice, and whether or not a default has occurred or demand has
been made,  terminate all or any part of the authority and permission  herein or
elsewhere  in this  Agreement  granted to the  Borrower  with  reference  to the
Collateral.

         Until the Bank shall otherwise notify the Borrower, all proceeds of and
collections of Collateral  shall be retained by the Borrower and used solely for
the

3

ordinary and usual operation of the Borrower's  business.  From and after notice
by the Bank to the Borrower,  all proceeds of and  collections of the Collateral
shall be held in trust by the Borrower for the Bank and shall not be  commingled
with  the  Borrower's  other  funds or  deposited  in any  bank  account  of the
Borrower; and the Borrower agrees to deliver to the Bank on the dates of receipt
thereof by the Borrower,  duly endorsed to the Bank or to bearer, or assigned to
the Bank, as may be appropriate, all proceeds of the Collateral in the identical
form received by the Borrower.

         4.  Allowances.  The  Borrower  may  grant  such  allowances  or  other
adjustments to Debtors  (exclusive of extending the time for payment of any item
which shall not be done without first  obtaining the Bank's  written  consent in
each instance) as the Borrower may reasonably deem to accord with sound business
practice,  including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing accepting
the return of all or any part of the Inventory  (subject to the  provisions  set
forth in this Agreement with reference to returned Inventory).

         5. Costs and Expenses.  The Borrower  shall pay to the Bank any and all
costs and expenses (including,  without limitation,  reasonable attorneys' fees,
court  costs,  litigation  and other  expenses)  incurred or paid by the Bank in
establishing,  maintaining,  protecting or enforcing any of the Bank's rights or
the  Obligations,  including,  without  limitation,  any and all such  costs and
expenses  incurred or paid by the Bank in defending the Bank's security interest
in, title or right to the  Collateral  or in collecting or attempting to collect
or enforcing or attempting to enforce payment of the Collateral.

         6. Books and  Records.  The  Borrower  shall hold its books and records
relating to the Collateral  segregated  from all the Borrower's  other books and
records in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; and shall deliver to the Bank from
time to time promptly at its request, all invoices, original documents of title,
contracts,  chattel paper,  instruments and any other writings relating thereto,
and other  evidence  of  performance  of  contracts,  or evidence of shipment or
delivery of the  merchandise  or of the rendering of services;  and the Borrower
will  deliver  to the Bank  promptly  at the  Bank's  request  from time to time
additional  copies of any or all of such  papers  or  writings,  and such  other
information  with  respect  to any of  the  Collateral  and  such  schedules  of
Inventory,  schedules of accounts and such other writings as the Bank may in its
sole discretion deem to be necessary or effectual to evidence any loan hereunder
or the Bank's security interest in the Collateral.

         7. Legends.  The Borrower  shall  promptly  make,  stamp or record such
entries  or  legends  on  the  Borrower's  books  and  records  or on any of the
Collateral  as the Bank shall request from time to time to indicate and disclose
that the Bank has a security interest in such Collateral.

         8. Inspection.  The Bank, or its representatives,  at any time and from
time to time, shall have the right, and the Borrower will permit it and them:

(a) to  examine,  check,  make  copies of or  extracts  from any of the
Borrower's books, records and files (including,  without limitation,  orders and
original correspondence);

4

(b) to inspect and examine the Borrower's Inventory or other Collateral
and to check and test the same as to quality, quantity, value and condition; and
the Borrower agrees to reimburse the Bank for its reasonable  costs and expenses
in so doing; and

         (c) to verify the Collateral or any portion or portions  thereof or the
Borrower's compliance with the provisions of this Agreement.

         9. Further Assurance. The Borrower will execute and deliver to the Bank
any writings and do all things necessary, or requested by the Bank to carry into
effect the provisions and intent of this Agreement,  or to vest more fully in or
assure to the Bank the security  interest in the Collateral  granted to the Bank
by this Agreement or to comply with applicable  statute or law and to facilitate
the collection of the Collateral,  including the  furnishing,  at the Borrower's
own cost and expense,  at such  intervals as the Bank may establish from time to
time,  of reports,  financial  data and  analyses  satisfactory  to the Bank.  A
carbon,  photographic  or other  reproduction of this Agreement or any financing
statement  executed  pursuant  to the  terms  hereof  shall be  sufficient  as a
financing statement for the purpose of filing with the appropriate authorities.

        10. Covenants and Warranties.  The Borrower  covenants with and warrants
to the Bank:

         (a) That all  Inventory in which the Bank is now or  hereafter  given a
security  interest  pursuant  to this  Agreement  will at all  times be kept and
maintained  in good  order and  condition  at the sole cost and  expense  of the
Borrower.

         (b) That the Borrower  will  maintain in force one or more  policies of
insurance  on all  Inventory  against  risks of fire  (with  customary  extended
coverage),  sprinkler leakage, theft, loss or damage and other risks customarily
insured  against  by  companies  engaged  in  businesses  similar to that of the
Borrower in such amounts, containing such terms, in such form, for such periods,
covering such hazards and written by such  companies as may be  satisfactory  to
the Bank, such insurance to be payable to the Bank as its interest may appear in
the event of loss;  the policies for the same shall be deposited  with the Bank;
no loss shall be adjusted  thereunder without the Bank's approval;  and all such
policies  shall  provide that they may not be cancelled  without first giving at
least ten (10) days' written  notice of  cancellation  to the Bank. In the event
that the Borrower fails to provide evidence of the maintenance of such insurance
satisfactory to the Bank, the Bank may, at is option,  secure such insurance and
charge the cost thereof to the Borrower and as a debit charge in the  Borrower's
Loan Account, if any, or any other account of the Borrower with the Bank. At the
option of the Bank, all insurance  proceeds  received from any loss or damage to
any of the  Collateral  shall be  applied  either to the  replacement  or repair
thereof  or as a  payment  on  account  of the  Obligations.  From and after the
occurrence of an Event of Default,  or after demand  respecting any  Obligations
payable upon demand,  the Bank is authorized to cancel any insurance  maintained
hereunder and apply any returned or unearned  premiums,  all of which are hereby
assigned to the Bank, as a payment on account of the Obligations.

(c) That at the date hereof the Borrower is (and as to Collateral  that
the Borrower may acquire after the date hereof, will be) the lawful owner of the
Collateral,  and that the  Collateral,  and each item thereof,  is, will be, and
shall continue to be free of all  restrictions,  liens,  encumbrances,  or other
rights,  title or interests (other than the security interest therein granted to
the Bank hereby),  credits,  defenses,  recoupments,  set-offs or  counterclaims
whatsoever;  that the  Borrower  has and will have full power and  authority  to
grant to the Bank a security  interest  therein,  and that the  Borrower has not
transferred,  assigned, sold, pledged, encumbered,  subjected to lien or granted
any security interest in, and will not transfer,  assign,  sell (except sales or
other dispositions in the ordinary course of business in respect to Inventory as
expressly  permitted in this Agreement),  pledge,  encumber,  subject to lien or
grant any security  interest in any of the  Collateral (or any of the Borrower's
right, title or interest  therein),  to any person other than the Bank; that the
Collateral is and will be valid and genuine in all  respects;  that all accounts
arise out of legally enforceable and existing contracts in accordance with their
tenor;  and that upon the  Borrower's  acquisition  of any  interest in contract
rights, it shall in writing  immediately  notify the Bank thereof,  specifically
identifying the same as contract  rights,  and, except for such contract rights,
no part of the  Collateral  (or  the  validity  or  enforceability  by the  Bank
thereof) is or shall be  contingent  upon the  fulfillment  of any  agreement or
condition  whatsoever  and  that  the  Collateral,   other  than  Inventory  and
Equipment,  shall represent  unconditional and undisputed bona fide indebtedness
by the Debtor for sales or leases of Inventory shipped and delivered or services
rendered by the  Borrower  to Debtor,  and is not and will not be subject to any
discount  (except  such cash or trade  discount as may be shown on any  invoice,
contract or other  writing  delivered to the Bank);  and that the Borrower  will
warrant and defend the Bank's  right to and interest in the  Collateral  against
all claims and demands of all persons whatsoever.

         (d)  That no contract  right,  account,  general  intangible or chattel
paper is or will be represented by any note or other  instrument  (negotiable or
otherwise),  and that no contract  right,  account or general  intangible is, or
will be represented by any conditional or installment  sales obligation or other
chattel  paper,  except  such  instruments  or  chattel  paper  as have  been or
forthwith  upon  receipt by the  Borrower  will be  delivered  to the Bank (duly
endorsed or assigned,  as may be  appropriate),  such  delivery,  in the case of
chattel paper,  to include all executed copies except those in the possession of
the  installment  buyer  and that any  security  for or  guaranty  of any of the
Collateral  shall be delivered to the Bank  immediately  upon receipt thereof by
the Borrower,  with such  assignments and  endorsements  thereof as the Bank may
request.

         (e)  That,  except  for  sale,  processing,  use  consumption  or other
disposition  in the  ordinary  course of business,  the  Borrower  will keep all
Inventory  only at  locations  specified  in this  Agreement;  that the Borrower
shall, during the term of this Agreement, keep the Bank currently and accurately
informed in writing of each location  where the Borrower's  records  relating to
its accounts and contract rights,  respectively,  are kept, and shall not remove
such records,  or any of them, to another state without giving the Bank at least
thirty  (30) days  prior  written  notice  thereof;  that the  Borrower's  chief
executive  office is  correctly  stated in the preamble to this  Agreement,  and
Borrower shall,  during the term of this Agreement,  keep the Bank currently and
accurately  informed  in writing of each of its other  places of  business,  and
shall not change the location of such chief executive office or open any new, or
close,  move or change any existing of new place of business  without giving the
Bank at 

7

least thirty (30) days prior written notice thereof.

         (f) That the Bank shall not be deemed to have assumed any  liability or
responsibility to the Borrower or any third person for the correctness, validity
or genuineness of any  instruments or documents that may be released or endorsed
to the Borrower by the Bank (which shall  automatically  be deemed to be without
recourse to the Bank in any event) or for the  existence,  character,  quantity,
quality,  condition, value or delivery of any goods purporting to be represented
by any such documents; and that the Bank, by accepting such security interest in
the  Collateral,  or by releasing any  Collateral to the Borrower,  shall not be
deemed to have assumed any  obligation or liability to any supplier or Debtor or
to any other third party,  and the Borrower  agrees to indemnify  and defend the
Bank and hold it harmless in respect to any claim or  proceeding  arising out of
any matter referred to in this Paragraph.

         (g) That each account or other item of Collateral, other than Inventory
and Equipment,  will be paid in full on or before the date shown as its due date
in the schedule of  Collateral,  in the copy of the  invoice(s)  relating to the
account or other  Collateral  or in contracts  relating  thereto;  that upon any
suspension  of  business,  assignment  or  trust  mortgage  for the  benefit  of
creditors,  dissolution,  petition in  receivership  or under any chapter of the
Bankruptcy  Code as amended  from time to time by or  against  any  Debtor,  any
Debtor  becoming  insolvent  or unable to pay its debts as they  mature,  or any
other act of the same or different nature amounting to a business  failure,  the
Borrower will forthwith notify the Bank thereof.

         (h) That the Borrower will  immediately  notify the Bank of any loss or
damage to, or material  diminution in or any  occurrence  which would  adversely
affect the value of, the Inventory, the Equipment or other Collateral.

         (i) That the Bank may from time to time in the Bank's  discretion  hold
and treat any  deposits  or other sums at any time  credited  by or due from the
Bank to the Borrower and any securities or other property of the Borrower in the
possession of the Bank,  whether for  safekeeping  or  otherwise,  as collateral
security  for and apply or set the same off against any  Obligations  whether or
not an Event of Default has occurred or demand has been made.  Without  limiting
the  generality  of the  foregoing,  if at any time the amount of the  revolving
credit as then set by the Bank shall be exceeded, the Borrower shall pay cash to
the Bank in the amount of such excess if the Bank so  requests,  or the Bank may
charge such amount against any deposit account of the Borrower with the Bank.

         (j) That if any of the Collateral includes a charge for, or if any loan
by the  Bank  to the  Borrower  shall  be  subject  to any  tax  payable  to any
governmental  taxing  authority,  the Borrower shall pay such tax  independently
when due.  The Bank may  retain  the full  proceeds  of the  Collateral  and the
Borrower  will  indemnify  and save  the Bank  harmless  from  any  loss,  cost,
liability  or expense  (including,  without  limitation,  reasonable  attorney's
fees), in connection therewith.

         (k) That at any time or times and  whether  or not an Event of  Default
has occurred or demand has been made,  the Bank may notify any Debtor or Debtors
of its security  interest in the Collateral and collect all amounts due thereon;
and the Borrower agrees, at the request of the Bank, to notify all or any of the
Debtors in writing of the Bank's security interest in the Collateral in whatever
manner the Bank  

7

requests  and, if the Bank so requests,  to permit the Bank to mail such notices
at the Borrower's expense.

         (l) That the Bank may, at its option, from time to time,  discharge any
taxes, liens or encumbrances of any of the Collateral,  or take any other action
that the Bank may  deem  proper  to  repair,  maintain  or  preserve  any of the
Collateral,  and the Borrower  will pay to the Bank on demand or the Bank in its
sole discretion may charge to the Borrower all amounts so paid or incurred by it
or as a debit charge against the Borrower's  loan account,  if any, or any other
deposit account of the Borrower with the Bank.

(m) That all  representations  now or hereafter made by the Borrower to
the  Bank,  whether  in this  Agreement  or in any  supporting  or  supplemental
reports, statements or documentation,  including, without limitation, statements
relating to the  Collateral  and financial  statements,  are, will be, and shall
continue to be true and correct in all respects.

11. Power of Attorney.  The Borrower hereby irrevocably  constitutes and
appoints the Bank as the Borrower's true and lawful attorney, with full power of
substitution,  at the sole cost and  expense  of the  Borrower  but for the sole
benefit of the Bank after  occurrence  of an Event of  Default,  to convert  the
Collateral into cash, including, without limitation,  completing the manufacture
or processing of work in process, and the sale (either public or private) of all
or any portion or portions of the  Inventory  and other  Collateral;  to enforce
collection  of the  Collateral,  either  in its own  name or in the  name of the
Borrower,  including,  without limitation,  executing releases,  compromising or
settling with any Debtors and prosecuting,  defending, compromising or releasing
any action relating to the Collateral;  to receive, open and dispose of all mail
addressed to the Borrower and to take  therefrom any  remittances or proceeds of
Collateral  in which the Bank has a security  interest;  to notify  Post  Office
authorities to change the address for delivery of mail addressed to the Borrower
to such address as the Bank shall designate; to endorse the name of the Borrower
in favor of the Bank  upon any and all  checks,  drafts,  money  orders,  notes,
acceptances or other  instruments of the same or different  nature;  to sign and
endorse the name of the  Borrower on and to receive as secured  party any of the
Collateral,  any invoices schedules of Collateral,  freight or express receipts,
or bills of lading, storage receipts,  warehouse receipts, or other documents of
title of the same or different  nature relating to the  Collateral;  to sign the
name of the  Borrower  on any notice of the  Debtors or on  verification  of the
Collateral;  and to sign  and file or  record  on  behalf  of the  Borrower  any
financing or other  statement in order to perfect or protect the Bank's security
interest. The Bank shall not be obliged to do any of the acts or exercise any of
the powers hereinabove authorized,  but if the Bank elects to do any such act or
exercise any such power,  it shall not be accountable  for more than it actually
receives as a result of such exercise of power,  and it shall not be responsible
to the Borrower except for willful misconduct in bad faith. All powers conferred
upon  the Bank by this  Agreement,  being  coupled  with an  interest,  shall be
irrevocable  so long as any  Obligation of the Borrower to the Bank shall remain
unpaid.

         Whenever  the  Bank  deems  it  desirable  that  any  legal  action  be
instituted  with 

8

respect to any  Collateral  or that any other  action be taken in any attempt to
effectuate  collection  of any  Collateral,  the Bank may  reassign  the item in
question to the Borrower (and if the Bank shall  execute any such  reassignment,
it shall  automatically  be deemed  to be  without  recourse  to the Bank in any
event) and require the  Borrower to proceed  with such legal or other  action at
the  Borrower's  sole  liability,  cost and expense,  in which event all amounts
collected  by the  Borrower  on such item shall  nevertheless  be subject to the
Bank's security interest.

        12. Default.  If an Event of Default shall occur, at the election of the
Bank, all Obligations shall become immediately due and payable without notice or
demand.

         The  Bank is  hereby  authorized,  at its  election,  after an Event of
Default or after  Demand,  without any further  demand or notice  except to such
extent as notice may be required by applicable  law, to take  possession  and/or
sell or otherwise  dispose of all or any of the  Collateral at public or private
sale;  and the Bank may also exercise any and all other rights and remedies of a
secured party under the Code or which are otherwise accorded to it by applicable
law, all as the Bank may  determine.  If notice of a sale or other action by the
Bank is required by  applicable  law,  unless the  Collateral  is  perishable or
threatens  to decline  speedily in value or is of a type  customarily  sold on a
recognized market, the Borrower agrees that five (5) days' written notice to the
Borrower,  or the  shortest  period of  written  notice  permitted  by such law,
whichever  is  larger,  shall  be  sufficient  notice;  and  that to the  extent
permitted  by law,  the Bank,  its  officers,  attorneys  and agents may bid and
become  purchasers at any such sale, if public,  and may purchase at any private
sale any of the Collateral  that is of a type  customarily  sold on a recognized
market or which is the subject of widely distributed  standard price quotations.
Any sale (public or private) shall be free from any right of  redemption,  which
the Borrower  hereby  waives and  releases.  No purchaser at any sale (public or
private) shall be responsible  for the  application of the purchase  money.  Any
balance of the net proceeds of sale  remaining  after paying all  Obligations of
the  Borrower  to the Bank shall be  returned  to the  Borrower or to such other
party as may be legally  entitled  thereto;  and if there is a  deficiency,  the
Borrower shall be responsible  for the same,  with interest.  Upon demand by the
Bank,  the Borrower  shall  assemble the Collateral and make it available to the
Bank at a place  designated  by the Bank which is  reasonably  convenient to the
Bank  and the  Borrower.  The  Borrower  hereby  acknowledges  that the Bank has
extended credit and other financial accommodations to the Borrower upon reliance
of the  Borrower's  granting the Bank the rights and remedies  contained in this
Agreement including without limitation the right to take immediate possession of
the  Collateral  upon the occurrence of an Event of Default or after DEMAND with
respect to Obligations  payable on DEMAND and the Borrower  hereby  acknowledges
that the Bank is entitled to equitable and  injunctive  relief to enforce any of
its rights and  remedies  hereunder  or under the Code and the  Borrower  hereby
waives  any  defense  to such  equitable  or  injunctive  relief  based upon any
allegation of the absence of irreparable harm to the Bank.

        13. Indemnification.  The Borrower shall indemnify, defend, and hold the
Bank harmless of and from any claim  brought or  threatened  against the Bank by
the Borrower, any guarantor or endorser of the Obligations,  or any other person
(as well from attorneys'  reasonable fees and expenses in connection  therewith)
on account of the Bank's  relationship  with the  Borrower,  or any guarantor or
endorser  of the  Obligations  (each  of  which  may be  defended,  compromised,
settled, or pursued by the Bank with counsel of the Bank's election,  but at the
expense of the Borrower).  The Borrowers  

9

shall not be required to  indemnify  the Bank from any loss or cost which arises
primarily from the Bank's own gross  negligence or intentional  misconduct.  The
within  indemnification  shall survive  payment of the  Obligations,  and/or any
termination,  release,  or  discharge  executed  by the  Bank  in  favor  of the
Borrower.

         14.  Waivers.  The  Borrower  waives  notice  of  nonpayment,   demand,
presentment,  protest  or notice of  protest  of the  Collateral,  and all other
notices,  consents to any renewals or extensions of time of payment thereof, and
generally  waives any and all  suretyship  defenses  and  defenses in the nature
thereof.  No delay or omission of the Bank in exercising or enforcing any of its
rights, powers,  privileges,  remedies,  immunities or discretions (all of which
are  hereinafter  collectively  referred to as "the Bank's rights and remedies")
hereunder shall  constitute a waiver  thereof;  and no waiver by the Bank of any
default of the Borrower  hereunder or of any demand shall operate as a waiver of
any other default  hereunder or of any other demand. No term or provision hereof
shall be waived,  altered or modified  except with the prior written  consent of
the Bank,  which consent makes explicit  reference to this Agreement.  Except as
provided in the  preceding  sentence,  no other  agreement  or  transaction,  of
whatsoever  nature,  entered  into between the Bank and the Borrower at any time
(whether  before,  during or after the effective date or term of this Agreement)
shall be construed as a waiver,  modification or limitation of any of the Bank's
rights and remedies  under this  Agreement (nor shall anything in this Agreement
be construed as a waiver, modification or limitation of any of the Bank's rights
and remedies under any such other agreement or  transaction)  but all the Bank's
rights and remedies not only under the  provisions  of this  Agreement  but also
under any such  other  agreement  or  transaction  shall be  cumulative  and not
alternative or exclusive, and may be exercised by the Bank at such time or times
and in  such  order  of  preference  as the  Bank  in its  sole  discretion  may
determine.

         15. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or portion of such
provision or the application  thereof to any person or circumstance shall to any
extent be held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement (or the
remainder of such  provision)  and the  application  thereof to other persons or
circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

         16. Binding Effect of Agreement.  This Agreement  shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the  respective  heirs,  executors,  administrators,
legal  representatives,  successors and assigns of the parties hereto, and shall
remain in full force and effect (and the Bank shall be entitled to rely thereon)
until  terminated as to future  transactions by written notice from either party
to the other party of the termination hereof; provided that any such termination
shall not  release  or affect any  Collateral  in which the Bank  already  has a
security interest or any Obligations  incurred or rights accrued hereunder prior
to  the  effective  date  of  such  notice  (as  hereinafter  defined)  of  such
termination.  Notwithstanding  any  such  termination,  the  Bank  shall  have a
security  interest in all  Collateral to secure the payment and  performance  of
Obligations  arising  after  such  termination  as a result  of  commitments  or
undertakings  made or entered  into by the Bank prior to such  termination.  The
Bank may transfer and assign this  Agreement  and deliver the  Collateral to the
assignee,  who shall  thereupon have all of the rights of the Bank; and the Bank
shall then be relieved and  discharged  of any any  responsibility  or liability
with respect to this Agreement and the Collateral.

10

17.  Notices.  Any notices under or pursuant to this Agreement shall be
deemed duly  received by the Borrower and  effective if delivered in hand to any
officer or agent of the Borrower,  or if mailed by registered or certified mail,
return  receipt  requested,  addressed  to the Borrower at the  Borrower's  last
address on the Bank's records. Any notices to the Bank under or pursuant to this
Agreement shall be mailed to the Bank by registered, certified, or express mail,
return  receipt  requested,  addressed  to the Bank at the address  shown at the
beginning of this  Agreement and shall be deemed  effective  five (5) days after
receipt by the Bank.

         18.  Massachusetts  Law. This Agreement is intended to take effect as a
sealed  instrument,  and it and all transactions  thereunder or pursuant thereto
shall be governed as to interpretation,  validity,  effect,  rights,  duties and
remedies of the parties  thereunder  and in all other  respects by the  internal
laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

         19. Reproductions.  This Agreement and all documents which have been or
may be  hereinafter  furnished by Borrower to the Bank may be  reproduced by the
Bank  by any  photographic,  photostatic,  microfilm,  xerographic,  or  similar
process,  and any such  reproduction  shall be  admissible  in  evidence  as the
original itself in any judicial or administrative proceeding (whether or not the
original is in existence  and whether or not such  reproduction  was made in the
regular course of business).

         20.  Jurisdiction  and  Venue.  Borrower  irrevocably  submits  to  the
non-exclusive  jurisdiction  of any  federal or state  court  sitting in Suffolk
County of  Massachusetts,  the County of Los Angeles,  California,  or at Bank's
discretion  any other court in which the Bank shall  initiate legal or equitable
proceedings and which has jurisdiction  over the parties and any suit, action or
proceeding  arising out of or relating to this Agreement.  Borrower  irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, any
objection it may have or  hereafter  have to the laying of the venue of any such
suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that the same
has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

         21.  JURY  WAIVER.   THE  BORROWER  AND  BANK  EACH  HEREBY  KNOWINGLY,
VOLUNTARILY  AND  INTENTIONALLY,  AND AFTER AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH LEGAL
COUNSEL, WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE OBLIGATIONS,  IN ALL MATTERS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY AND DOCUMENTS  EXECUTED IN CONNECTION  HEREWITH.  THE BORROWER  CERTIFIES
THAT  NEITHER  THE BANK NOR ANY OF ITS  REPRESENTATIVES,  AGENTS OR COUNSEL  HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT THE BANK WOULD NOT IN THE EVENT OF ANY
SUCH PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

AGREEMENT   entered   into   at  100   Federal   Street,   Boston,
Massachusetts this 25th day of November 1996 between BPI Packaging (UK) Limited,
a Private Limited Company incorporated under the United Kingdom Companies Act of
1985 with a registered office situated at 211 Picadilly,  London, England W1V9LD
(hereinafter  called  the  "Guarantor")  and  Foothill  Capital  Corporation,  a
California  corporation with a place of business at 1111 Santa Monica Boulevard,
Los Angeles,  California (the "Lender"). The tangible personal property which is
the  subject  matter of this  Agreement  is and will be kept at the  Guarantor's
address indicated above.

           1 . Grant of Security  Interest.  In  consideration  of the  Lender's
extending financial  accommodations to the Guarantor,  through loans made to BPI
Packaging  Technologies,  Inc. ("BPI") under a Loan and Security  Agreement (the
"Loan Agreement") dated November __,1996, and to secure Guarantor's  obligations
pursuant  to   Guarantor's   Guaranty  of  the   obligations  of  BPI  Packaging
Technologies,  Inc. to the Lender,  the Guarantor  hereby grants to the Lender a
security  interest in and  floating  charge in and against  (including,  without
limitation,  a lien on and  pledge  of) all of the  Guarantor's  Collateral  (as
hereinafter defined).  The security interest and floating charge granted by this
Agreement  is  given to and  shall be held by the  Lender  as  security  for the
payment and performance of all Obligations (as hereinafter defined).  The Lender
shall  have the  unrestricted  right  from time to time  apply (or to change any
application already made of) the proceeds of any of the Collateral to any of the
Obligations,  as the Lender in its sole discretion may determine.  The Guarantor
will,  at such  intervals as the Lender may request,  notify the Lender,  upon a
form satisfactory to the Lender, of all Collateral which has come into existence
since  the date  hereof or the date of the last  such  notification,  including,
without limitation,  the delivery of schedules of the Collateral and/or proceeds
resulting from the sale or other disposition thereof.

           2. Definitions. The following definitions shall apply:

(i)   All Inventory;

          (ii)   All accounts, accounts receivable, contract rights, and chattel
                 paper, regardless of whether or not they constitute proceeds of
                 other Collateral;

         (iii)   All  general  intangibles,  regardless  of  whether or not they
                 constitute  proceeds of other  Collateral,  including,  without
                 limitation,  all of the  Guarantor's  rights to tax refunds and
                 all the  Guarantor's  rights  (which 

1

the Lender may exercise or not as it in its sole discretion may
                 determine)  to acquire or obtain  goods  and/or  services  with
                 respect  to  the  manufacture,   processing,   storage,   sale,
                 shipment,  delivery or  installation  of any of the Guarantor's
                 inventory or other Collateral:

permits the Guarantor to hold, process,  sell, use or consume in the manufacture
or processing of finished goods, or otherwise  dispose of the Inventory for fair
consideration,   all  in  the  ordinary  course  of  the  Guarantor's  business,
excluding,  without limitation,  sales to creditors or in bulk or sales or other
dispositions  occurring under circumstances which would or could create any lien
or interest adverse to the Lender's  security  interest or other right hereunder
in the  proceeds  resulting  therefrom.  The Lender also hereby  authorizes  and
permits the Guarantor to receive from the Debtors all amounts due as proceeds of
the Collateral at the Guarantor's own cost and expense,  and also liability,  if
any,  subject to the direction  and control of the Lender at all times;  and the
Lender may at any time,  without  cause or notice,  and whether or not a default
has occurred or demand has been made, terminate all or any part of the authority
and permission  herein or elsewhere in this  Agreement  granted to the 

3

Guarantor with reference to the Collateral.

           Until the Lender shall otherwise  notify the Guarantor,  all proceeds
of and  collections  of  Collateral  shall be retained by the Guarantor and used
solely for the ordinary and usual  operation of the Guarantor's  business.  From
and after notice by the Lender to the Guarantor, all proceeds of and collections
of the  Collateral  shall be held in trust by the  Guarantor  for the Lender and
shall not be  commingled  with the  Guarantor's  other funds or deposited in any
bank account of the Guarantor; and the Guarantor agrees to deliver to the Lender
on the dates of receipt thereof by the Guarantor, duly endorsed to the Lender or
to bearer, or assigned to the Lender, as may be appropriate, all proceeds of the
Collateral in the identical form received by the Guarantor.

           4.  Allowances.  The  Guarantor  may grant such  allowances  or other
adjustments to Debtors  (exclusive of extending the time for payment of any item
which shall not be done without first obtaining the Lender's  written consent in
each  instance)  as the  Guarantor  may  reasonably  deem to accord  with  sound
business practice,  including,  without limiting the generality of the foregoing
accepting  the  return  of all or any  part  of the  Inventory  (subject  to the
provisions set forth in this Agreement with reference to returned Inventory).

           5. Costs and Expenses.  The Guarantor shall pay to the Lender any and
all costs and expenses  (including,  without limitation,  reasonable  attorneys'
fees, court costs, litigation and other expenses) incurred or paid by the Lender
in establishing, maintaining, protecting or enforcing any of the Lender's rights
or the Obligations,  including,  without limitation,  any and all such costs and
expenses  incurred  or paid by the Lender in  defending  the  Lender's  security
interest in, title or right to the  Collateral or in collecting or attempting to
collect or enforcing or attempting to enforce payment of the Collateral.

           6. Books and Records.  The Guarantor shall hold its books and records
relating to the Collateral  segregated from all the Guarantor's  other books and
records in a manner  satisfactory to the Lender; and shall deliver to the Lender
from time to time promptly at its request,  all invoices,  original documents of
title,  contracts,  chattel paper,  instruments and any other writings  relating
thereto, and other evidence of performance of contracts, or evidence of shipment
or  delivery  of the  merchandise  or of the  rendering  of  services;  and  the
Guarantor will deliver to the Lender promptly at the Lender's  request from time
to time  additional  copies of any or all of such papers or  writings,  and such
other  information  with respect to any of the  Collateral and such schedules of
Inventory,  schedules of accounts  and such other  writings as the Lender may in
its sole  discretion  deem to be  necessary  or  effectual  to evidence any loan
hereunder or the Lender's security interest in the Collateral.

           7. Legends.  The Guarantor shall promptly make,  stamp or record such
entries  or  legends  on the  Guarantor's  books  and  records  or on any of the
Collateral  as the  Lender  shall  request  from  time to time to  indicate  and
disclose that the Lender has a security interest in such Collateral.

           8. Inspection.  The Lender, or its  representatives,  at any time and
from time to time,  shall have the right,  and the Guarantor  will permit it and
them:

4

(a) to examine,  check,  make  copies of or extracts  from any of the
Guarantor's books, records and files (including,  without limitation, orders and
original correspondence);

           (b) to  inspect  and  examine  the  Guarantor's  Inventory  or  other
Collateral  and to check and test the same as to  quality,  quantity,  value and
condition;  and the Guarantor  agrees to reimburse the Lender for its reasonable
costs and expenses in so doing; and

           (c) to verify the  Collateral  or any portion or portions  thereof or
the Guarantor's compliance with the provisions of this Agreement.

9. Further  Assurance.  The Guarantor will execute and deliver to the
Lender any writings and do all things  necessary,  or requested by the Lender to
carry into effect the provisions and intent of this  Agreement,  or to vest more
fully in or assure to the Lender the security interest in the Collateral granted
to the Lender by this Agreement or to comply with applicable  statute or law and
to facilitate the collection of the Collateral, including the furnishing, at the
Guarantor's own cost and expense,  at such intervals as the Lender may establish
from time to time, of reports,  financial data and analyses  satisfactory to the
Lender.  A carbon,  photographic or other  reproduction of this Agreement or any
financing statement executed pursuant to the terms hereof shall be sufficient as
a  financing   statement  for  the  purpose  of  filing  with  the   appropriate
authorities.

          10.  Covenants  and  Warranties.  The  Guarantor  covenants  with  and
warrants to the Lender:

(a) That all Inventory in which the Lender is now or hereafter  given
a security  interest  pursuant to this  Agreement  will at all times be kept and
maintained  in good  order and  condition  at the sole cost and  expense  of the
Guarantor.

           (b) That the Guarantor will maintain in force one or more policies of
insurance  on all  Inventory  against  risks of fire  (with  customary  extended
coverage),  sprinkler leakage, theft, loss or damage and other risks customarily
insured  against  by  companies  engaged  in  businesses  similar to that of the
Guarantor  in such  amounts,  containing  such  terms,  in such  form,  for such
periods,  covering  such  hazards  and  written  by  such  companies  as  may be
satisfactory  to the Lender,  such  insurance to be payable to the Lender as its
interest  may appear in the event of loss;  the  policies  for the same shall be
deposited  with the  Lender;  no loss shall be adjusted  thereunder  without the
Lender's  approval;  and all such  policies  shall  provide that they may not be
cancelled  without  first  giving  at least  ten (10)  days'  written  notice of
cancellation  to the Lender.  In the event that the  Guarantor  fails to provide
evidence of the maintenance of such insurance  satisfactory  to the Lender,  the
Lender may, at is option,  secure such  insurance and charge the cost thereof to
the Guarantor and as a debit charge in the Guarantor's Loan Account,  if any, or
any other account of the Guarantor with the Lender. At the option of the Lender,
all insurance proceeds 

5

received  from any loss or  damage  to any of the  Collateral  shall be  applied
either to the  replacement  or repair  thereof or as a payment on account of the
Obligations.  From and after the  occurrence  of an Event of  Default,  or after
demand respecting any Obligations  payable upon demand, the Lender is authorized
to cancel any insurance  maintained hereunder and apply any returned or unearned
premiums,  all of which are  hereby  assigned  to the  Lender,  as a payment  on
account of the Obligations.

           (c) That at the date hereof the  Guarantor  is (and as to  Collateral
that the Guarantor may acquire after the date hereof,  will be) the lawful owner
of the Collateral,  and that the Collateral, and each item thereof, is, will be,
and shall continue to be free of all restrictions, liens, encumbrances, or other
rights,  title or interests (other than the security interest therein granted to
the Lender hereby), credits,  defenses,  recoupments,  set-offs or counterclaims
whatsoever;  that the  Guarantor  has and will have full power and  authority to
grant to the Lender a security interest therein,  and that the Guarantor has not
transferred,  assigned, sold, pledged, encumbered,  subjected to lien or granted
any security interest in, and will not transfer,  assign,  sell (except sales or
other dispositions in the ordinary course of business in respect to Inventory as
expressly  permitted in this Agreement),  pledge,  encumber,  subject to lien or
grant any security  interest in any of the Collateral (or any of the Guarantor's
right, title or interest therein), to any person other than the Lender; that the
Collateral is and will be valid and genuine in all  respects;  that all accounts
arise out of legally enforceable and existing contracts in accordance with their
tenor;  and that upon the  Guarantor's  acquisition  of any interest in contract
rights, it shall in writing immediately notify the Lender thereof,  specifically
identifying the same as contract  rights,  and, except for such contract rights,
no part of the  Collateral  (or the  validity  or  enforceability  by the Lender
thereof) is or shall be  contingent  upon the  fulfillment  of any  agreement or
condition  whatsoever  and  that  the  Collateral,   other  than  Inventory  and
Equipment,  shall represent  unconditional and undisputed bona fide indebtedness
by the Debtor for sales or leases of Inventory shipped and delivered or services
rendered by the  Guarantor to Debtor,  and is not and will not be subject to any
discount  (except  such cash or trade  discount as may be shown on any  invoice,
contract or other writing delivered to the Lender);  and that the Guarantor will
warrant and defend the Lender's right to and interest in the Collateral  against
all claims and demands of all persons whatsoever.

           (d) That no contract right,  account,  general  intangible or chattel
paper is or will be represented by any note or other  instrument  (negotiable or
otherwise),  and that no contract  right,  account or general  intangible is, or
will be represented by any conditional or installment  sales obligation or other
chattel  paper,  except  such  instruments  or  chattel  paper  as have  been or
forthwith  upon receipt by the  Guarantor  will be delivered to the Lender (duly
endorsed or assigned,  as may be  appropriate),  such  delivery,  in the case of
chattel paper,  to include all executed copies except those in the possession of
the  installment  buyer  and that any  security  for or  guaranty  of any of the
Collateral shall be delivered to the Lender  immediately upon receipt thereof by
the Guarantor,  with such assignments and endorsements thereof as the Lender may
request.

           (e) That,  except  for sale,  processing,  use  consumption  or other
disposition  in the ordinary  course of business,  the  Guarantor  will keep all
Inventory  only at locations  specified in this  Agreement;  that the  Guarantor
shall,  during  the  term of this  Agreement,  keep  the  Lender  currently  and
accurately  informed in writing of each 

6

location  where the  Guarantor's  records  relating to its accounts and contract
rights,  respectively,  are kept,  and shall not remove such records,  or any of
them, to another state without giving the Lender at least thirty (30) days prior
written notice thereof; that the Guarantor's chief executive office is correctly
stated in the preamble to this Agreement,  and Guarantor shall,  during the term
of this Agreement,  keep the Lender currently and accurately informed in writing
of each of its other  places of  business,  and shall not change the location of
such  chief  executive  office  or open any new,  or close,  move or change  any
existing of new place of business without giving the Lender at least thirty (30)
days prior written notice thereof.

           (f) That the Lender shall not be deemed to have assumed any liability
or  responsibility  to the  Guarantor or any third  person for the  correctness,
validity or genuineness of any  instruments or documents that may be released or
endorsed to the Guarantor by the Lender (which shall  automatically be deemed to
be without recourse to the Lender in any event) or for the existence, character,
quantity,  quality,  condition,  value or delivery of any goods purporting to be
represented  by any such  documents;  and that the  Lender,  by  accepting  such
security  interest in the  Collateral,  or by releasing  any  Collateral  to the
Guarantor,  shall not be deemed to have assumed any  obligation  or liability to
any supplier or Debtor or to any other third party,  and the Guarantor agrees to
indemnify  and defend the Lender and hold it harmless in respect to any claim or
proceeding arising out of any matter referred to in this Paragraph.

           (g)  That  each  account  or other  item of  Collateral,  other  than
Inventory  will be paid in full on or before  the date  shown as its due date in
the  schedule  of  Collateral,  in the copy of the  invoice(s)  relating  to the
account or other  Collateral  or in contracts  relating  thereto;  that upon any
suspension  of  business,  assignment  or  trust  mortgage  for the  benefit  of
creditors,  dissolution,  petition in  receivership  or under any chapter of the
Bankruptcy  Code as amended  from time to time by or  against  any  Debtor,  any
Debtor  becoming  insolvent  or unable to pay its debts as they  mature,  or any
other act of the same or different nature amounting to a business  failure,  the
Guarantor will forthwith notify the Lender thereof.

           (h) That the Guarantor will immediately notify the Lender of any loss
or damage to, or material  diminution in or any occurrence which would adversely
affect the value of, the Inventory, or other Collateral.

           (i) That the Lender may from time to time in the Lender's  discretion
hold and treat any  deposits  or other sums at any time  credited by or due from
the  Lender  to the  Guarantor  and any  securities  or  other  property  of the
Guarantor in the possession of the Lender, whether for safekeeping or otherwise,
as collateral security for and apply or set the same off against any Obligations
whether or not an Event of Default has occurred or demand has been made. Without
limiting  the  generality  of the  foregoing,  if at any time the  amount of the
revolving  credit as then set by the Lender  shall be  exceeded,  the  Guarantor
shall pay cash to the  Lender  in the  amount  of such  excess if the  Lender so
requests,  or the Lender may charge such amount  against any deposit  account of
the Guarantor with the Lender.

           (j) That if any of the  Collateral  includes a charge  for, or if any
loan by the Lender to the  Guarantor  shall be subject to any tax payable to any
governmental  taxing  authority,  the Guarantor shall pay such tax independently
when due.  The Lender 

7

may retain the full proceeds of the  Collateral and the Guarantor will indemnify
and save  the  Lender  harmless  from  any  loss,  cost,  liability  or  expense
(including,  without  limitation,  reasonable  attorney's  fees),  in connection
therewith.

           (k) That at any time or times and  whether or not an Event of Default
has  occurred  or demand  has been  made,  the  Lender  may notify any Debtor or
Debtors of its security  interest in the  Collateral and collect all amounts due
thereon;  and the Guarantor  agrees, at the request of the Lender, to notify all
or any of the  Debtors in  writing  of the  Lender's  security  interest  in the
Collateral  in  whatever  manner  the  Lender  requests  and,  if the  Lender so
requests, to permit the Lender to mail such notices at the Guarantor's expense.

           (l) That the Lender may, at its option, from time to time,  discharge
any taxes,  liens or encumbrances  of any of the  Collateral,  or take any other
action  that the Lender may deem proper to repair,  maintain or preserve  any of
the Collateral, and the Guarantor will pay to the Lender on demand or the Lender
in its sole  discretion  may  charge to the  Guarantor  all  amounts  so paid or
incurred by it or as a debit charge  against the  Guarantor's  loan account,  if
any, or any other deposit account of the Guarantor with the Lender.

           (m) That the  Lender in its sole  discretion  from time to time shall
have the right to demand and receive from the Guarantor  additional  property of
nature and types not included in this Agreement,  including, without limitation,
interests in real property,  and thereupon the words  "Collateral" and "security
interest" shall be deemed to include,  any and all such additional  property and
the Lender's  interests therein.  The Guarantor shall promptly,  upon request of
the  Lender,  deliver,  transfer,  assign  and make over to the  Lender  all the
Guarantor's right, title and interest in any such additional property; and shall
execute  and  deliver to the Lender any  writings  and do all things  necessary,
effectual  or  requested  by the Lender to vest fully in or assure to the Lender
(including,  without  limitation,  all steps to create and perfect) its security
interest in such additional  property.  The Lender shall have in respect to such
additional  property  all  the  rights,  powers,  privileges,   discretions  and
immunities  granted to it under this Agreement with the same force and effect as
if  said  additional  property  had  been  listed  herein,  including,   without
limitation,  the right to apply  such  property,  or any part  thereof,  and any
proceeds thereof to any Obligation.

           (n) That all  representations  now or hereafter made by the Guarantor
to the Lender,  whether in this Agreement or in any  supporting or  supplemental
reports, statements or documentation,  including, without limitation, statements
relating to the  Collateral  and financial  statements,  are, will be, and shall
continue to be true and correct in all respects.

11. Power of Attorney.  The Guarantor hereby  irrevocably  constitutes
and appoints the Lender as the Guarantor's true and lawful  attorney,  with full
power of substitution, at the sole cost and expense of the Guarantor but for the
sole  benefit of the Lender,  to convert the  Collateral  into cash,  including,
without limitation, completing the manufacture or processing of work in process,
and the sale (either public or private) of all or any portion or portions of the
Inventory and other Collateral; to enforce collection of the Collateral,  either
in its own name or in the 

8

name  of the  Guarantor,  including,  without  limitation,  executing  releases,
compromising   or  settling  with  any  Debtors  and   prosecuting,   defending,
compromising  or releasing any action  relating to the  Collateral;  to receive,
open and dispose of all mail  addressed to the Guarantor  and to take  therefrom
any  remittances  or proceeds of  Collateral  in which the Lender has a security
interest;  to notify Post Office  authorities to change the address for delivery
of  mail  addressed  to the  Guarantor  to  such  address  as the  Lender  shall
designate;  to endorse the name of the Guarantor in favor of the Lender upon any
and all checks, drafts, money orders, notes, acceptances or other instruments of
the same or different  nature;  to sign and endorse the name of the Guarantor on
and to receive as secured party any of the Collateral, any invoices schedules of
Collateral,  freight or express receipts, or bills of lading,  storage receipts,
warehouse receipts,  or other documents of title of the same or different nature
relating to the  Collateral;  to sign the name of the Guarantor on any notice of
the Debtors or on verification of the Collateral; and to sign and file or record
on behalf of the Guarantor any financing or other  statement in order to perfect
or protect the Lender's security interest. The Lender shall not be obliged to do
any of the acts or exercise any of the powers hereinabove authorized, but if the
Lender  elects to do any such act or exercise  any such  power,  it shall not be
accountable  for more than it actually  receives as a result of such exercise of
power,  and it shall not be  responsible  to the  Guarantor  except for  willful
misconduct in bad faith. All powers conferred upon the Lender by this Agreement,
being coupled with an interest,  shall be  irrevocable so long as any Obligation
of the Guarantor to the Lender shall remainunpaid.

           Whenever  the  Lender  deems it  desirable  that any legal  action be
instituted  with respect to any  Collateral or that any other action be taken in
any attempt to effectuate collection of any Collateral,  the Lender may reassign
the item in question to the Guarantor  (and if the Lender shall execute any such
reassignment,  it shall  automatically  be deemed to be without  recourse to the
Lender in any event) and require  the  Guarantor  to proceed  with such legal or
other action at the Guarantor's sole liability, cost and expense, in which event
all  amounts  collected  by the  Guarantor  on such item shall  nevertheless  be
subject to the Lender's security interest.

          12. Default.  If an Event of Default  shall occur,  at the election of
the Lender,  all  Obligations  shall become  immediately due and payable without
notice or demand,  except with respect to Obligations  payable on DEMAND,  which
shall be due and  payable  on DEMAND,  whether  or not an Event of  Default  has
occurred.

           The Lender is hereby authorized,  at its election,  after an Event of
Default or after  Demand,  without any further  demand or notice  except to such
extent as notice may be required by applicable  law, to take  possession  and/or
sell or otherwise  dispose of all or any of the  Collateral at public or private
sale;  and the Lender may also exercise any and all other rights and remedies of
a  secured  party  under  the  Code or which  are  otherwise  accorded  to it by
applicable  law, all as the Lender may  determine.  If notice of a sale or other
action by the Lender is required by  applicable  law,  unless the  Collateral is
perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily
sold on a recognized  market,  the Guarantor  agrees that five (5) days' written
notice to the Guarantor,  or the shortest period of written notice  permitted by
such law,  whichever  is larger,  shall be  sufficient  notice;  and that to the
extent permitted by law, the Lender, its officers,  attorneys and agents may bid
and become  purchasers  at any such sale,  if public,  and may  purchase  at any
private 

9

sale any of the Collateral  that is of a type  customarily  sold on a recognized
market or which is the subject of widely distributed  standard price quotations.
Any sale (public or private) shall be free from any right of  redemption,  which
the Guarantor  hereby  waives and releases.  No purchaser at any sale (public or
private) shall be responsible  for the  application of the purchase  money.  Any
balance of the net proceeds of sale  remaining  after paying all  Obligations of
the  Guarantor to the Lender shall be returned to the Guarantor or to such other
party as may be legally  entitled  thereto;  and if there is a  deficiency,  the
Guarantor shall be responsible  for the same, with interest.  Upon demand by the
Lender, the Guarantor shall assemble the Collateral and make it available to the
Lender at a place designated by the Lender which is reasonably convenient to the
Lender and the Guarantor.  The Guarantor hereby acknowledges that the Lender has
extended  credit  and  other  financial  accommodations  to the  Guarantor  upon
reliance  of the  Guarantor's  granting  the  Lender  the  rights  and  remedies
contained  in this  Agreement  including  without  limitation  the right to take
immediate  possession  of the  Collateral  upon  the  occurrence  of an Event of
Default or after  DEMAND with respect to  Obligations  payable on DEMAND and the
Guarantor  hereby  acknowledges  that the Lender is  entitled to  equitable  and
injunctive  relief to enforce any of its rights and remedies  hereunder or under
the Code and the  Guarantor  hereby  waives  any  defense to such  equitable  or
injunctive relief based upon any allegation of the absence of irreprable harm to
the Lender.

           13. Indemnification.  The Guarantor shall indemnify, defend, and hold
the Lender  harmless  of and from any claim  brought or  threatened  against the
Lender by the Guarantor,  any guarantor or endorser of the  Obligations,  or any
other person (as well from attorneys' reasonable fees and expenses in connection
therewith) on account of the Lender's  relationship  with the Guarantor,  or any
guarantor  or  endorser  of the  Obligations  (each  of which  may be  defended,
compromised,  settled,  or pursued by the Lender  with  counsel of the  Lender's
election, but at the expense of the Guarantor). The within indemnification shall
survive  payment  of  the  Obligations,  and/or  any  termination,  release,  or
discharge executed by the Lender in favor of the Guarantor.

           14.  Waivers.  The  Guarantor  waives notice of  nonpayment,  demand,
presentment,  protest  or notice of  protest  of the  Collateral,  and all other
notices,  consents to any renewals or extensions of time of payment thereof, and
generally  waives any and all  suretyship  defenses  and  defenses in the nature
thereof.  No delay or omission of the Lender in  exercising  or enforcing any of
its rights,  powers,  privileges,  remedies,  immunities or discretions  (all of
which are  hereinafter  collectively  referred  to as "the  Lender's  rights and
remedies")  hereunder shall  constitute a waiver  thereof;  and no waiver by the
Lender of any default of the Guarantor  hereunder or of any demand shall operate
as a waiver of any other default  hereunder or of any other  demand.  No term or
provision  hereof  shall be waived,  altered or  modified  except with the prior
written  consent of the Lender,  which consent makes explicit  reference to this
Agreement.  Except as provided in the preceding sentence,  no other agreement or
transaction,  of  whatsoever  nature,  entered  into  between the Lender and the
Guarantor at any time (whether  before,  during or after the  effective  date or
term  of this  Agreement)  shall  be  construed  as a  waiver,  modification  or
limitation of any of the Lender's  rights and remedies under this Agreement (nor
shall  anything in this  Agreement  be construed  as a waiver,  modification  or
limitation  of any of the  Lender's  rights  and  remedies  under any such other
agreement  or  transaction)  but all the  Lender's  rights and remedies not only
under the provisions of this  Agreement but also under any such other  agreement
or transaction shall be cumulative and not alternative 

10

or  exclusive,  and may be  exercised by the Lender at such time or times and in
such order of preference as the Lender in its sole discretion may determine.

           15.  Severability.  If any provision of this  Agreement or portion of
such provision or the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall to
any extent be held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement (or
the remainder of such provision) and the application thereof to other persons or
circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

           16. Binding Effect of Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the  respective  heirs,  executors,  administrators,
legal  representatives,  successors and assigns of the parties hereto, and shall
remain in full  force and  effect  (and the  Lender  shall be  entitled  to rely
thereon)  until  terminated  as to future  transactions  by written  notice from
either party to the other party of the  termination  hereof;  provided  that any
such termination  shall not release or affect any Collateral in which the Lender
already has a security  interest or any  Obligations  incurred or rights accrued
hereunder prior to the effective date of such notice (as hereinafter defined) of
such termination.  Notwithstanding any such termination, the Lender shall have a
security  interest in all  Collateral to secure the payment and  performance  of
Obligations  arising  after  such  termination  as a result  of  commitments  or
undertakings made or entered into by the Lender prior to such  termination.  The
Lender may transfer and assign this  Agreement and deliver the Collateral to the
assignee,  who shall  thereupon  have all of the rights of the  Lender;  and the
Lender  shall then be  relieved  and  discharged  of any any  responsibility  or
liability with respect to this Agreement and the Collateral.

           17. Notices. Any notices under or pursuant to this Agreement shall be
deemed duly  received by the Guarantor and effective if delivered in hand to any
officer or agent of the Guarantor, or if mailed by registered or certified mail,
return receipt  requested,  addressed to the Guarantor at the  Guarantor's  last
address on the Lender's records.  Any notices to the Lender under or pursuant to
this  Agreement  shall be mailed  to the  Lender by  registered,  certified,  or
express mail, return receipt  requested,  addressed to the Lender at the address
shown at the beginning of this Agreement and shall be deemed  effective five (5)
days after receipt by the Lender.

           18.  Reproductions.  This Agreement and all documents which have been
or may be hereinafter  furnished by Guarantor to the Lender may be reproduced by
the Lender by any photographic,  photostatic, microfilm, xerographic, or similar
process,  and any such  reproduction  shall be  admissible  in  evidence  as the
original itself in any judicial or administrative proceeding (whether or not the
original is in existence  and whether or not such  reproduction  was made in the
regular course of business).

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT

                              SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

         This  Settlement  Agreement is made,  entered into, and effective as of
this 19th day of December, 1996 (the "Effective Date"), by and between Mobil Oil
Corporation, a New York corporation with its principal place of business at 3225
Gallows Road, Fairfax, Virginia 22037 ("Mobil"), and BPI Packaging Technologies,
Inc.,  a  Delaware  corporation  with its  principal  place of  business  at 455
Somerset Avenue, Dighton, Massachusetts 02764 ("BPI").

         WHEREAS,  Mobil  filed  an  action  against  BPI in the  United  States
District  Court for the  District of Delaware  (Civil  Action No.  95-737)  (the
"Action") alleging  infringement of Mobil's U.S. Patent No. Re. 34,019 (the "019
patent"),  which  issued on August 4, 1992 and is directed  to plastic  carrying
bags;

         WHEREAS,  BPI filed a counterclaim against Mobil in the Action alleging
infringement of BPI's U.S. Patent No. 4,877,473 (the "473 patent"), which issued
on October 31, 1989 and is directed to a method of making a bag pack;

         WHEREAS,  Mobil and BPI are desirous of reaching a final settlement and
disposition of their respective claims against each other in the Action;

         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual undertakings  hereinafter
set forth, Mobil and BPI agree as follows:

         1. BPI shall pay Mobil the sum of X* in four equal  installments  of X*
on each of the  following  dates:  July 15, 1997,  April 15, 1998,  February 15,
1999, and December 15, 1999.

Payment shall be made by check made payable to Mobil Oil Corporation.

*Certain  information withheld and filed separately with the Commission pursuant
to a request for confidential treatment.

                                        1

2. BPI's payment obligations  hereunder will be considered  liquidated,
due and  owing  as of the date of this  Settlement  Agreement,  and are  neither
contingent upon, nor subject to modification by, any action or event whatsoever,
including,  but not limited to, the outcome of the Action  against the remaining
defendants, Inteplast Corporation and Integrated Bagging Systems Corporation, or
any finding of  non-infringement,  invalidity  or  unenforceability  of the '019
patent.

         3. BPI shall provide its reasonable cooperation in response to specific
informal  discovery  requests  from Mobil,  to the extent that the  documents or
information  requested by Mobil would have been  otherwise  discoverable  in the
Action. If requested by Mobil, Dennis N. Caulfield,  President of BPI, agrees to
appear and  testify as a witness at the trial in the  Action.  If so  requested,
Mobil will  reimburse  BPI for its costs in making Mr.  Caulfield  available  to
testify at trial.

         4.  In the  event  of  any  default  under  this  Settlement  Agreement
(including  any failure to make any payment in accordance  with the schedule set
forth in paragraph 1), Mobil shall have the right to seek an immediate  judgment
in any court of competent  jurisdiction for the immediate  payment of the entire
amount  of X* less any  amounts  already  paid to Mobil  under  this  Settlement
Agreement ("Remaining Liability").  In any such action by Mobil to enforce BPI's
obligations under this Settlement  Agreement,  BPI shall interpose no objections
to entry of judgment for the Remaining  Liability.  BPI shall be liable to Mobil
for all costs,  including  attorneys' fees,  incurred in collecting said amounts
due and owing from BPI to Mobil.

         5. Mobil hereby  releases BPI from all  liability for past damages with
respect to the '019 patent.  This  release  shall not be deemed a release of any
claims under the '019 patent against any party other than BPI.

6. BPI hereby  releases  Mobil from all liability for past damages with
respect to the '473 patent.  This  release  shall not be deemed a release of any
claims under the '473 patent against any party other than Mobil.

         7.  Within  ten (10) days of the  Effective  Date,  Mobil and BPI shall
jointly  file in the  Action a joint  motion in the form of  Appendix A and take
such other action as may be necessary to cause the Action to be dismissed,  with
prejudice, as between Mobil and BPI.

         8.  Mobil and BPI shall  each  bear its own  costs and  attorneys  fees
associated with the Action.

         9. Mobil hereby  grants to BPI an  irrevocable,  nonexclusive,  paid-up

for the full term of the '019 patent.

methods covered by the '473 patent and to make, use, and sell bags in accordance
with the methods  covered by the '473 patent.  This license shall extend for the
full term of the '473 patent.

         11.  The terms of this  Settlement  Agreement  shall be  maintained  in
confidence by Mobil and BPI, and neither Mobil nor BPI shall  disclose the terms
of this  Settlement  Agreement  to any third party,  except  pursuant to a court
order or as required by law. The parties  agree,  however,  that prior to making
any disclosure of the Settlement  Agreement pursuant to a court order, the party
which  has been or may be  ordered  to make  such a  disclosure  shall  give the
earliest  possible notice to the other party and shall permit the other party to
contest the court order or its application to the Settlement Agreement.

understanding  between  Mobil and BPI with respect to the subject  matter hereof

and understandings relating thereto. This Settlement Agreement may not be varied
or modified other than by a writing executed on behalf of the parties.

         13. This  Settlement  Agreement  shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of Mobil and BPI and their respective successors and assigns;  provided,
however,  that neither party may assign or transfer the licenses  granted herein
without the prior written consent of the licensing  party. Any attempt to assign
or transfer a license  without the prior written  consent of the licensing party
shall be null and void and shall not be binding on the licensing party.

         14. Any payment,  notice,  or communication  required by or relating to
this Settlement Agreement shall be in writing and delivered to Mobil at:

Delaware.  Mobil  and BPI  consent  to be  subject  to the  jurisdiction  of the
Delaware state and federal courts with regard to any litigation arising from any
