 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM DATED MARCH 13, 2006

exv99w3 

Exhibit 99.3 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors of General Motors Acceptance Corporation:

We have examined management s assertion that General Motors Acceptance Corporation (the  Company )
has complied, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005, and for the period from the
respective date of sale for the trust to December 31, 2005, with its established minimum servicing
standards listed in the Appendix, as described in the accompanying Management s Assertion dated
March 13, 2006, as it relates to Superior Wholesale Inventory Financing Trust XI. Management is
responsible for the Company s compliance with those minimum servicing standards. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance
based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board and accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance
with its minimum servicing standards and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
with its minimum servicing standards.

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned minimum
servicing standards as of and for the period from the respective date of sale for the trust to
December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects based on the criteria set forth in
the Appendix.
