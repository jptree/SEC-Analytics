PART I        
  ITEM 1.    Business       Mewbourne Energy Partners 02-A, L.P. (the  Registrant  or the
 Partnership ) is a limited partnership organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on February 27, 2002 (date of inception). Its managing general partner is Mewbourne Development Corporation, a Delaware corporation
( MD ).      A Registration Statement was filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, registering limited and general partnership
interests in a series of two Delaware limited partnerships formed under Mewbourne Energy 02-03 Drilling Programs. General and limited partnership interests were offered at $1,000 each. The maximum offering amount was $18,000,000 (18,000 interests)
per partnership. The Registrant was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 26, 2002. On October 10, 2002, the offering of limited and general partnership interests in the Registrant was closed, with interests
aggregating $16,072,000 originally being sold to 647 subscribers of which $14,667,000 were sold to 597 subscribers as general partner interests and $1,405,000 were sold to 50 subscribers as limited partner interests.      The Registrant engages primarily in oil and gas development and production and is not involved in any other industry segment. See the selected financial data in
Item 6 and the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a summary of the Registrant s revenue, income and identifiable assets.      The
sale of crude oil and natural gas produced by the Registrant will be affected by a number of factors that are beyond the Registrant s control. These factors include the price of crude oil and natural gas, the fluctuating supply of and demand
for these products, competitive fuels, refining, transportation, extensive federal and state regulations governing the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, and other competitive conditions. It is impossible to predict with any certainty
the future effect of these factors on the Registrant.      The Registrant does not have long-term contracts with purchasers of its crude oil or natural gas.
The market for crude oil is such that the Registrant anticipates it will be able to sell all the crude oil it can produce. Natural gas will be sold to local distribution companies, gas marketers and end users on the spot market. The spot market
reflects immediate sales of natural gas without long-term contractual commitments. The future market condition for natural gas cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the Registrant may experience delays in marketing natural gas production and
fluctuations in natural gas prices.      Many aspects of the Registrant s activities are highly competitive including, but not limited to, the acquisition
of suitable drilling prospects and the procurement of drilling and related oil field equipment, and are subject to governmental regulation, both at Federal and state levels. The Registrant s ability to compete depends on its financial resources
and on the managing general partner s staff and facilities, none of which are significant in comparison with those of the oil and gas exploration, development and production industry as a whole. Federal and state regulation of oil and gas
operations generally includes drilling and spacing of wells on producing acreage, the imposition of maximum allowable production rates, the taxation of income and other items, and the protection of the environment.

Table of Contents  

   The Registrant does not have any employees of its own. MD is responsible for all management functions. Mewbourne Oil
Company ( MOC ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Mewbourne Holdings, Inc., which is also the parent of the Registrant s managing general partner, has been appointed Program Manager and is responsible for activities in accordance with a
Drilling Program Agreement entered into by the Registrant, MD and MOC. At March 30, 2006, MOC employed 157 persons, many of whom dedicated a part of their time to the conduct of the Registrant s business during the period for which this
report is filed.      The production of oil and gas is not considered subject to seasonal factors although the price received by the Registrant for natural gas
sales will generally tend to increase during the winter months. Order backlog is not pertinent to the Registrant s business.       
  ITEM 2.    Properties       The Registrant s properties consist primarily of leasehold interests in
properties on which oil and gas wells-in-progress are located. Such property interests are often subject to landowner royalties, overriding royalties and other oil and gas leasehold interests.      Fractional working interests in developmental oil and gas prospects located primarily in the Anadarko Basin of Western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle, and the Permian
Basin of New Mexico and West Texas, were acquired by the Registrant, resulting in the Registrant s participation in the drilling of oil and gas wells. At December 31, 2005, 44 wells had been drilled; 39 wells were productive and 5 wells
were abandoned. The following table summarizes the Registrant s drilling activity for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003:       
    Reserve estimates were prepared by Forrest A Garb   Associates, Inc., the Registrant s independent
petroleum consultants, in accordance with guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission.       
  ITEM 3.    Legal Proceedings       The Registrant is not aware of any pending legal proceedings to which it
is a party.       
  ITEM 4.    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders       No matter was submitted to a vote of
security holders during the period ended December 31, 2005 covered by this report.

PART II        
  ITEM 5.    Market for Registrant s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters       At
March 30, 2006, the Registrant had 16,072 outstanding limited and general partnerships interests held of record by 648 subscribers. There is no established public or organized trading market for the limited and general partner interests.
     Revenues which, in the sole judgment of the managing general partner, are not required to meet the Registrant s obligations will be distributed to
the partners at least quarterly in accordance with the Registrant s Partnership Agreement. Distributions made to limited and general partners during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, were $3,918,284, $4,165,589 and
$4,335,000, respectively.       
  ITEM 6.    Selected Financial Data       The following table sets forth selected financial data for the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, and for the period from February 27, 2002 (date of inception) through December 31, 2002:       
     
  ITEM 7.    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       General      The Registrant was organized as a Delaware limited partnership on February 27, 2002. The offering of limited
and general partnership interests began June 26, 2002 as a part of an offering registered under the name Mewbourne Energy Partners 02-03 Drilling Programs. The offering of limited and general partner interests in the Registrant concluded
October 10, 2002, with total investor partner contributions of $16,072,000.

   The Registrant was formed to engage primarily in the business of drilling development wells, to produce and market crude
oil and natural gas produced from such properties, to distribute any net proceeds from operations to the general and limited partners and to the extent necessary, acquire leases which contain drilling prospects. The economic life of the Registrant
depends on the period over which the Registrant s oil and gas reserves are economically recoverable.      Results of
Operations      The following table sets forth certain operating data for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003:       
    Year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31,
2004      Oil and natural gas sales. As shown in the table above, total oil and gas sales decreased $824,720 (14.3%) for the year ended December 31,
2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Of this decrease, $186,156 and $2,596,054, respectively, were related to decreases in volumes of oil and gas sold. Volumes of oil and gas sold decreased 3,449 bbls of oil and 376,169 mcf of
gas for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in volumes of oil sold was primarily due to a substantial decline in the production of four wells. The decrease in volumes of gas sold
was primarily due to (i) normal declines in production and (ii) a substantial decline in the production of one well. The wells with a substantial decline in production are not expected to return to previous levels of production. These
decreases were partially offset by increases of $117,835 and $1,839,655, respectively, related to increases in the average prices of oil and gas sold. Average oil and gas prices increased to $53.97 per bbl and $6.90 per mcf for the year ended
December 31, 2005 from $39.01 per bbl and $5.17 per mcf for the year ended December 31, 2004.      Interest income.
Interest income increased from $1,022 in 2004 to $1,694 in 2005.      Lease operating expense and production taxes. Lease operating expense decreased from
$558,194 in 2004 to $500,283 in 2005. Lease operating expense decreased primarily due to well repair and maintenance expenses for two wells in the period ended December 31, 2004, as compared to one well for the period ended December 31,
2005. Production taxes decreased from $467,150 in 2004 to $397,350 in 2005. Production taxes decreased due to decreased oil and gas revenues for 2005.      Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased from $1,721,974 in 2004 to $1,157,130 in 2005. The decrease is primarily due to the decline in production volumes. There were no cost ceiling
write-downs for 2005 or 2004.

Table of Contents  

   Year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003      Oil and natural gas sales. As shown in the table above, total oil and gas sales decreased $520,915 (8.3%) for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to
the year ended December 31, 2003. Of this decrease, $15,197 and $999,663, respectively, were related to decreases in volumes of oil and gas sold. Volumes of oil and gas sold decreased 389 bbls of oil and 192,410 mcf of gas for the year ended
December 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in volumes of oil sold was primarily due to normal declines in production partially offset by recompletions of two wells. The decrease in volumes of gas sold
was primarily due to normal declines in production partially offset by the addition of one well late in the quarter ended December 31, 2003. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $81,388 and $412,557, respectively, related to
increases in the average prices of oil and gas sold. Average oil and gas prices increased to $39.01 per bbl and $5.17 per mcf for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $29.16 per bbl and $4.84 per mcf for the year ended December 31, 2003.
     Interest income. Interest income decreased from $14,666 in 2003 to $1,022 in 2004 due to expenditures for the drilling of oil and gas wells, which
resulted in a decrease of capital available for investments.      Lease operating expense and production taxes. Lease operating expense increased from $407,910
in 2003 to $558,194 in 2004. Lease operating expense increased due to the addition of one well at the end of 2003, the workover of one well, and the increased operating expenses of another well due to increased water production after a workover.
Production taxes decreased from $506,407 in 2003 to $467,150 in 2004. Production taxes decreased due to decreased oil and gas revenues for 2004.      Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased from $2,112,507 in 2003 to $1,721,974 in 2004. The decrease is primarily due to the decline in production volumes. There was no cost ceiling
write-down for 2004 compared to $8,687 in 2003.      Liquidity and capital resources      Net cash increased by $206 during the year ended December 31, 2005. Cash flows from operating activities were utilized primarily for cash distributions to partners. All wells for which funds have been committed
have been drilled. Any incidental future capital expenditures incurred will be paid with revenues generated through oil and gas sales. Revenues which, in the sole judgment of the managing general partner, are not required to meet the
Registrant s obligations will be distributed to the partners at least quarterly in accordance with the Registrant s Partnership Agreement.      Critical Accounting Policies      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.      Significant estimates inherent in the Registrant s financial
statements include the estimate of oil and gas reserves and future abandonment costs as reported in the footnotes to the financial statements. Changes in oil and gas prices and the changes in production estimates could have a significant effect on
reserve estimates. The reserve estimates directly impact the computation of depreciation, depletion, and amortization, asset retirement obligation, and the ceiling test for the Registrant s oil and gas properties.         
   7   

Table of Contents  

   The Registrant follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil and gas activities. Under the full-cost method, all
productive and non-productive costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties subject to amortization is computed on the
units-of-production method based on the proved reserves underlying the oil and gas properties. Oil and gas properties are subject to a quarterly ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net cash flows of
proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties. The present value of future net cash flows has been prepared assuming year-end selling prices, year-end development and production costs and a 10 percent annual discount
rate.      All financing activities of the Registrant are reported in the financial statements. The Registrant does not engage in any off-balance sheet
financing arrangements.      Asset Retirement Obligations      On January 1, 2003, the Partnership adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 143 ( FAS 143 ),  Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.  This statement changes the
financial accounting and reporting obligations associated with the retirement and disposal of long-lived assets, including the Partnership s oil and gas properties, and the associated asset retirement costs.      A liability for the estimated fair value of the future plugging and abandonment costs is recorded with a corresponding increase in the full cost pool at the time a new
well is drilled. Depreciation expense associated with estimated plugging and abandonment costs is recognized in accordance with the full cost methodology.      The Partnership estimates a liability for plugging and abandonment costs based on historical experience and estimated well life. The liability is discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Revisions to the liability could occur
due to changes in well plugging and abandonment costs or well useful lives, or if federal or state regulators enact new well restoration requirements. The Partnership recognizes accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the
remaining life of the well.      A reconciliation of the Partnership s liability for well plugging and abandonment costs for the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004, is as follows:

   Organization and Related Party Transactions      The Partnership was organized on February 27, 2002. Mewbourne Development Corporation (MD) is managing general partner and Mewbourne Oil Company (MOC) is operator of
oil and gas properties owned by the Partnership. Mewbourne Holdings, Inc. is the parent of both MD and MOC. Substantially all transactions are with MD and MOC.      In the ordinary course of business, MOC will incur certain costs that will be passed on to well owners of the well for which the costs were incurred. The partnership will receive their portion of these costs based upon their ownership in
each well incurring the costs. These costs are referred to as operator charges and are standard and customary in the oil and gas industry. Operator charges include recovery of gas marketing costs, fixed rate overhead, supervision, pumping, and
equipment furnished by the operator. Reimbursement to MOC for operator charges totaled $240,918, $204,953 and $928,846 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Operator charges are billed in accordance with the
program and partnership agreements.      In general, during any particular calendar year, the total amount of administrative expenses allocated to the
Partnership by MOC shall not exceed the greater of (a) 3.5% of the Partnership s gross revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas production during each year (calculated without any deduction for operating costs or other costs and
expenses) or (b) the sum of $50,000 plus .25% of the capital contributions of limited and general partners. Under this arrangement, $167,511, $182,993 and $182,037 were allocated to the Partnership during the years ended December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.      The Partnership participates in oil and gas activities through a Drilling Program Agreement (the  Program ). The
Partnership and MD are parties to the Program. The costs and revenues of the Program are allocated to MD and the Partnership as follows:

  As noted above, pursuant to the Program, MD must contribute 100% of organization and offering costs and lease acquisition costs which approximate 30% of total capital costs. To the
extent that organization and offering costs and lease acquisition costs are less than 30% of total capital costs, MD is responsible for tangible drilling costs until its share of the Program s total capital costs reaches approximately 30%.
       The Partnership s financial statements reflect its respective proportionate interest in the Program.

provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the financial statements and other disclosures included in this report, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition. Within 90 days prior to the filing of this report,
MD s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of it s disclosure controls and procedures with the assistance and participation of other members of management. Based
upon that evaluation, MD s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that it s disclosure controls and procedures are effective for gathering, analyzing and disclosing the information the Partnership is required to
disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. There have been no significant changes in MD s internal controls or in other factors which could
significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date MD carried out its evaluation.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm       To the Partners of Mewbourne Energy Partners 02-A, L.P. and to the
Board of Directors of Mewbourne Development Corporation:      In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheets and the related statements of operations, of
changes in partners  capital and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Mewbourne Energy Partners 02-A, L.P. at December 31, 2005 and 2004 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
     As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 143,
 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,  as of January 1, 2003 and changed the manner in which it accounts for asset retirement costs.      /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP      Dallas, Texas      March 31, 2006

Mewbourne Energy Partners 02-A, L.P.       NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      1. Significant Accounting Policies:      Accounting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities      Mewbourne Energy Partners 02-A, L.P., (the  Partnership ), a Delaware limited
partnership engaged primarily in oil and gas development and production in Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, was organized on February 27, 2002. The offering of limited and general partnership interests began June 26, 2002 as a part of an
offering registered under the name Mewbourne Energy Partners 02-03 Drilling Programs, (the  Program ), and concluded October 10, 2002, with total investor contributions of $16,072,000 originally being sold to 647 subscribers of which
$14,667,000 were sold to 597 subscribers as general partner interests and $1,405,000 were sold to 50 subscribers as limited partner interests. During the quarter ended March 31, 2004, all general partner interests were converted to limited
partner interests.      The Program s sole business is the development and production of oil and gas with a concentration on gas. Substantially all of the
Program s gas reserves are being sold regionally in the spot market. Due to the highly competitive nature of the spot market, prices are subject to seasonal and regional pricing fluctuations. In addition, such spot market sales are generally
short-term in nature and are dependent upon obtaining transportation services provided by pipelines. The prices received for the Program s oil and gas are subject to influences such as global consumption and supply trends.      The Partnership follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil and gas activities. Under the full-cost method, all productive and non-productive costs incurred
in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties subject to amortization is computed on the units-of-production method based on the proved
reserves underlying the oil and gas properties. At December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 all capitalized costs were subject to amortization. Proceeds from the sale or other disposition of properties are credited to the full cost pool. Gains and
losses are not recognized unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and the proved oil and gas reserves. Capitalized costs are subject to a quarterly ceiling test that limits such costs to the
aggregate of the present value of future net cash flows of proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties. There were no cost ceiling write-downs for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, while at
December 31, 2003 there was a cost ceiling write-down of $8,687.      Significant estimates inherent in the Registrant s financial statements include
the estimate of oil and gas reserves and future abandonment costs as reported in the footnotes to the financial statements. Changes in oil and gas prices and the changes in production estimates could have a significant effect on reserve estimates.
The reserve estimates directly impact the computation of depreciation, depletion, and amortization, asset retirement obligation, and the ceiling test for the Registrant s oil and gas properties.      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.         
   22   

Table of Contents  

   Cash      The
Partnership maintains all its cash in one financial institution. At various times throughout the year, the cash amount may be in excess of the amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.      Asset Retirement Obligations      On January 1, 2003, the
Partnership adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 143 ( FAS 143 ),  Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.  This statement changes the financial accounting and reporting obligations associated with the
retirement and disposal of long-lived assets, including the Partnership s oil and gas properties, and the associated asset retirement costs.      A
liability for the estimated fair value of the future plugging and abandonment costs is recorded with a corresponding increase in the full cost pool at the time a new well is drilled. Depreciation expense associated with estimated plugging and
abandonment costs is recognized in accordance with the full cost methodology.      The Partnership estimates a liability for plugging and abandonment costs
based on historical experience and estimated well life. The liability is discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in well plugging and abandonment costs or well useful lives, or if
federal or state regulators enact new well restoration requirements. The Partnership recognizes accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the remaining life of the well.      A reconciliation of the Partnership s liability for well plugging and abandonment costs for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, is as follows:

Table of Contents  

   Oil and Gas Sales      The Program s oil and condensate production is sold, title passed, and revenue recognized at or near the Program s wells under short-term purchase contracts at prevailing prices in accordance with arrangements which are customary
in the oil industry. Sales of gas applicable to the Program s interest are recorded as revenue when the gas is metered and title transferred pursuant to the gas sales contracts covering the Program s interest in gas reserves. The
Partnership uses the sales method to recognize oil and gas revenue whereby revenue is recognized for the amount of production taken regardless of the amount for which the Partnership is entitled based on its working interest ownership. As of
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, no material gas imbalances between the Partnership and other working interest owners existed.      Income Taxes      The Partnership is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes, and as a result, income of the Partnership is reported on the
tax returns of the partners and no recognition is given to income taxes in the financial statements.      2. Organization and
Related Party Transactions:      The Partnership was organized on February 27, 2002. Mewbourne Development Corporation (MD) is managing general partner and
Mewbourne Oil Company (MOC) is operator of oil and gas properties owned by the Partnership. Mewbourne Holdings, Inc. is the parent of both MD and MOC. Substantially all transactions are with MD and MOC.      In the ordinary course of business, MOC will incur certain costs that will be passed on to well owners of the well on which the costs were incurred. The partnership will
receive their portion of these costs based upon their ownership in each well incurring the costs. These costs are referred to as Operator charges and are standard and customary in the oil and gas industry. Operator charges include recovery of gas
marketing costs, fixed rate overhead, supervision, pumping, and equipment furnished by the Operator. Reimbursement to MOC for operator charges totaled $240,918, $204,953 and $928,846 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Operator charges are billed in accordance with the program and partnership agreements.      In general, during any particular calendar year, the
total amount of administrative expenses allocated to the Partnership by MOC shall not exceed the greater of (a) 3.5% of the Partnership s gross revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas production during each year (calculated without
any deduction for operating costs or other costs and expenses) or (b) the sum of $50,000 plus .25% of the capital contributions of limited and general partners. Under this arrangement, $167,511, $182,993 and $182,037 were allocated to the
Partnership during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

  As noted above, pursuant to the Program, MD must contribute 100% of organization and offering costs and lease acquisition costs which will approximate 30% of total capital costs. To
the extent that organization and offering costs and lease acquisition costs are less than 30% of total capital costs, MD is responsible for tangible drilling costs until its share of the Program s total capital costs reaches approximately 30%.
       The Partnership s financial statements reflect its respective proportionate interest in the Program.      3. Reconciliation of Net income per Statements of Operations with Net income per Federal Income Tax Return:      The following is a reconciliation of net income per statements of operations with net income per federal income tax return for the years ended December 31, 2005,

    Capitalized costs related to oil and natural gas acquisition, exploration and development activities for the years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows:       
    Depreciation, depletion and amortization per one thousand cubic feet of gas equivalents was $1.63, $1.55 and $1.62
for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

   Estimated Net Quantities of Proved Oil and Gas Reserves:      Reserve estimates as well as certain information regarding future production and discounted cash flows were determined by the Partnership s independent petroleum
consultants and MOC s petroleum reservoir engineers. The Partnership considers reserve estimates to be reasonable, however, due to inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of oil and gas reserves are imprecise
and subject to change over time as additional information becomes available.      There have been no favorable or adverse events that have caused a significant
change in estimated proved reserves since December 31, 2005. The Partnership has no long-term supply agreements or contracts with governments or authorities in which it acts as producer nor does it have any interest in oil and gas operations
accounted for by the equity method. All reserves are located onshore within the United States.      Proved Reserves:

   Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows:      For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003      The Standardized
measure of discounted future net cash flows from estimated production of proved oil and gas reserves is presented in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 69,  Disclosures about Oil and Gas
Producing Activities  (SFAS No. 69). In computing this data, assumptions other than those mandated by SFAS No. 69 could produce substantially different results. The Partnership cautions against viewing this information as a forecast
of future economic conditions, revenues, or fair value.      The standardized measure has been prepared assuming year-end selling prices, year-end development
and production costs and a 10 percent annual discount rate. No future income tax expense has been provided for the Partnership since it incurs no income tax liability. (See Significant Accounting Policies   Income Taxes in Note 1 to the
Financial Statements.) The year-end prices were $58.63 per barrel of oil and $7.37 for MCF of gas as of December 31, 2005, $41.87 per barrel of oil and $5.27 for MCF of gas as of December 31, 2004, and $30.34 per barrel of oil and $5.66
for MCF of gas as of December 31, 2003.
