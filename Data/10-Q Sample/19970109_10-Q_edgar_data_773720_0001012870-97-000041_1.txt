Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
of Operations
- -------------

     This section of the report contains forward-looking statements regarding
the Company's expected growth and enhanced future performance.  All forward-
looking statements are subject to risk and actual results could differ
materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of
many factors which are set forth below.

Results of Operations
- ---------------------

     Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 1997 ended October 31, 1996
increased by $357,000 or 8% to $4,572,000 from $4,215,000 in the third quarter
of fiscal 1996 ended October 31, 1995.  Net sales for the first nine months of
fiscal 1997 were $12,758,000 or 16% higher than net sales of $11,028,000 in the
first nine months of fiscal 1996.  The increases were due to continued strong
demand for the company's RedLine test cell products.  Sales growth in the third
quarter was limited by delays in the receipt of certain expected orders, coupled
with a vendor's delay in the delivery of necessary components.

     Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to 41% in this year's
third quarter from 39% in the same period last year.  Cost of sales as a
percentage of net sales also increased to 42% in the first nine months this year
compared to 38% in the same period of fiscal 1996.  The increases primarily
reflect the expansion of the service staff to increase the company's capacity to
build, install and commission RedLine products.  These new personnel were
brought on-board ahead of time to support expected growth in this area.

     Research and development expenses decreased by $57,000 to $564,000 in the
third quarter this year compared to $621,000 in the same period last year while
expenses in the first nine months of this year increased slightly to $1,633,000
from $1,623,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 1996.  The slight increase in
expenses in the first nine months resulted primarily from the ramp up of joint
new product development with FEV, the Company's strategic ally in Germany and
offset by higher capitalization of software development costs in this year's
first nine months.

     Marketing, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of
fiscal 1997 increased by $380,000 or 28% to $1,737,000 compared to the same
period a year ago.  Expenses in the first nine months of this year increased by
$941,000 to $4,859,000 from $3,918,000 last year. As a percentage of sales,
however, expenses remained consistent throughout the year at 38% compared with
last year's expenses at 32% in the third quarter and 36% in the first nine
months.  The higher expenses were principally due to additional sales and
marketing staff, costs associated with improvements in the company's information
technology infrastructure and higher internal sales commissions due to higher
sales bookings.

     Net interest income was $13,000 in this year's third quarter compared to
$32,000 last year.  Net interest income for the first nine months this year was
the same as last year's at $95,000.  The lower interest income in the third
quarter this year reflect lower available cash invested in interest-bearing
accounts.

     The effective tax rate computed were 34% for the third quarter and 33% for
the first nine months this year compared to 39% for the third quarter and first
nine months last year.  The lower tax rates this year reflect the increased
profit contributions of the company's UK subsidiary which benefits from a lower
tax rate.  The company reviews the tax rate quarterly and could make minor
adjustments to reflect changing estimates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
- -------------------------------

     Cash decreased by $1,117,000 during the nine month period ended October 31,
1996.  The decrease was due to the increase in accounts receivable brought about
by high shipments in the last month of the period.  The primary use of the
Company's cash in the first nine months of fiscal 1997 has been: a) the purchase
of capital equipment used to equip additional personnel and to upgrade our
information systems capabilities, and b) investment in software development.

     Working capital at October 31, 1996 improved to $5,533,000 compared to
$5,472,000 at the beginning of the fiscal year, while the current ratio stood at
3.1 to 1.0 at October 31, 1996 and at 3.2 to 1.0 at January 31, 1996.  At
October 31, 1996, the Company has a $1,000,000 secured bank line of credit.  The
Company currently anticipates that internally generated funds and bank
borrowings will be sufficient to satisfy its anticipated operating and capital
needs over the foreseeable future.

     At October 31, 1996, the Company had no material outstanding commitments to
purchase capital equipment.  Management believes that inflation has not had a
material effect on the Company's operations or financial condition.

Factors That May Affect Future Results
- --------------------------------------
 
     The Company's future operating results may be affected by a number of
factors, including: its ability to successfully introduce new products, services
and enhancements for its customers as demands for increasingly sophisticated
measurement and control systems and turnkey solutions continue; timing of
receipt of major system orders; product mix; uncertainties relative to global
economic conditions; the company's ability to withstand competition particularly
from several companies that are much larger in size than the Company; natural
disasters, particularly earthquakes which may strike the California area where
the Company's headquarters and manufacturing facility are located; and
availability and cost of components for its products.
 
     At the end of last fiscal year, management made a strategic decision to
focus on the services side of our transportation market business.  These
services include systems integration, project management, commissioning and
installation and coupled with our RedLine products, will allow us to fuel our
growth in the transportation market by providing one stop shopping to our
customers.  These services provide us the capability to provide turnkey systems
where they are required.  Hence, we have invested in system integration,
installation and commissioning staff during the first half of the year.
However, the introduction of these services raises several risk factors.
Specifically, the success depends on the time it takes for these personnel and
future staff to come up to speed on our products, customers and the services
they will provide; market acceptance of the services and pricing; and efficient
use of these resources.
