NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(Unaudited) 

(1) Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
BMC Software, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the Company or BMC). All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

These financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of
management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented. These
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of
Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by
generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. Certain amounts
previously reported have been reclassified to provide comparability among the periods reported.
Those reclassifications did not impact our net earnings or stockholders  equity.

These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial
statements for the year ended March 31, 2005, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on Form 10-K.

(2) Earnings Per Share 

Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution
that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted
into common stock. For purposes of this calculation, outstanding stock options and unearned
restricted stock are considered potential common shares using the treasury stock method. For the
three-month periods ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, the treasury stock method effect of 13.1
million and 6.5 million weighted options, respectively, has been excluded from the calculation of
diluted EPS, as they are anti-dilutive. For the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2004 and
2005, the treasury stock method effect of 24.0 million and 13.9 million weighted options,
respectively, has been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS, as they are anti-dilutive. The
following table summarizes the basic and diluted EPS computations for the three months and nine
months ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively:

(3) Business Combinations 

On August 24, 2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of KMXperts Inc.
The aggregate purchase price was $5.3 million in cash, including direct deal costs, and was
allocated as follows: $2.5 million to acquired technology with a weighted average estimated life of
three years, $0.6 million to customer relationships with a weighted average estimated life of three
years, $1.9 million to goodwill, $0.1 million to a non-compete agreement to be amortized over a
two-year period and $0.2 million to tangible assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed.

Table of Contents   

KMXperts  results have been included in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements since the acquisition date as part of the Service Management segment. KMXperts
technology provides knowledge management solutions for IT service and customer support centers.
The purchase agreement included a $1.5 million payment for post-acquisition services to be paid at
the one-year anniversary of the purchase. This payment will be recorded as compensation expense
over the twelve-month period of service, as it is based solely on continued employment with BMC.

4) Segment Reporting 

Management reviews the results of the Company s software business by the following product
categories: Mainframe Management, including the Mainframe Data Management and MAINVIEW    product
lines; Distributed Systems Management, which includes the PATROL    ,  Distributed Systems Data
Management and Scheduling   Output Management product lines; Service Management; and Identity
Management. In addition to these software segments, Professional Services is also considered a
separate segment. The software segments above reflect management s recategorization of certain
products during fiscal 2006 to clarify accountability and increase organizational effectiveness.
The amounts reported below for the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2004 and 2005
reflect these changes in the composition of the Company s business segments.

For the Mainframe Management, Distributed Systems Management and Professional Services
segments, segment performance is measured based on contribution margin, reflecting only the direct
controllable expenses of the segments. Segment performance for the Service Management segment is
measured based on its direct controllable research and development (R D) and marketing and
professional services costs. Segment performance for the Identity Management segment is measured
based on its direct controllable R D and marketing costs and the costs of the dedicated Identity
Management sales and services team in North America. As such, management s measure of profitability
for these segments does not include allocation of indirect R D expenses and certain support costs,
the effect of software development cost capitalization and amortization, other selling and
marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, amortization of acquired technology and
intangibles, one-time charges, other income, net, and income taxes. The costs associated with the
exit activities described in note 6 herein are included in indirect expenses. Assets and
liabilities are not accounted for by segment.

(5) Stock Incentive Plans 

The Company has numerous stock plans that provide for the grant of common stock options and
restricted stock to employees and directors of the Company. Under the option plans, all options
issued during the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2004 and 2005 have been granted
with exercise prices equal to the quoted market price on the date of grant and have a ten-year
term, except for the 2.1 million replacement stock options issued below fair market value and 0.2
million replacement stock options issued above fair market value during the three months ended
September 30, 2004 as consideration in the Marimba acquisition. The purchase price for this
acquisition included $20.9 million related to the replacement options issued, of which $8.0 million
was allocated to unearned portion of stock-based compensation, reflecting the portion of the
intrinsic value of the 1.2 million unvested options issued that will be earned over the remaining
vesting periods of those options. This amount will be recognized as compensation expense over the
remaining vesting periods of the options for the options that ultimately vest. The restricted stock
issued under the Company s stock plans is subject to transfer restrictions that lapse over one to
four years. The Company also has an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) under which rights to
purchase the Company s common stock are granted at 85% of the lesser of the market value of the
common stock at the offering date or on the exercise date.

The Company currently accounts for stock-based employee compensation using the intrinsic value
method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees  and related interpretations, which generally requires that the amount of
compensation cost that must be recognized, if any, is the quoted market price of the stock at the
measurement date, which is the grant date, less the amount the grantee is required to pay to
acquire the stock. Alternatively, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123,
 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,  employs fair value-based measurement and generally
results in the recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based awards to employees. SFAS
No. 123 does not require an entity to adopt those provisions, but rather, permits continued
application of APB Opinion No. 25 accompanied by footnote disclosure of the pro forma impacts under
SFAS No.123. The Company has elected not to adopt the recognition and measurement provisions of
SFAS No. 123 and continues to account for its stock-based employee compensation plans under APB
Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations. In accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, deferred
compensation is generally recorded for stock-based employee compensation grants based on the excess
of the market value of the common stock on the measurement date over the exercise price. The
deferred compensation is amortized to expense over the vesting period of each unit of stock-based
employee compensation granted. If the exercise price of the stock-based compensation is equal to or
exceeds the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant, no compensation
expense is recorded.

For the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, the Company recorded compensation
expense of $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively, for restricted stock grants. For the nine
months ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, the Company recorded compensation expense of $1.0 million
and $0.7 million, respectively for restricted stock grants. The Company was not required to record
compensation expense for stock option grants and stock issued under the ESPP during the same
periods, except for unvested replacement options issued as consideration in the Company s July 15,
2004 acquisition of Marimba, Inc. For the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, the
Company recorded compensation expense of $1.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, related to
the Marimba transaction replacement options. For the nine months ended December 31, 2004 and 2005,
the Company recorded compensation expense of $1.9 million and $1.7 million, respectively, related
to the Marimba transaction replacement options.

The compensation expense recorded for restricted stock grants under the intrinsic value method
is consistent with the expense that would be recorded under the fair value-based method. Had the
compensation cost for the Company s employee stock option grants, as well as stock issued under the
ESPP been determined based on grant date fair values of awards estimated using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model, which is consistent with the method described in SFAS No. 123, the Company s
reported net earnings and earnings per share would have been reduced to the following pro forma
amounts:

Table of Contents   

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123(R),
 Share-Based Payment,  which is a revision of SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion
No. 25 and amends SFAS No. 95,  Statement of Cash Flows.  Generally, the approach in SFAS No.
123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in
the statement of operations based on their fair values. SFAS No. 123(R) permits adoption using one
of two methods: (1) a  modified prospective  method in which compensation cost is recognized
beginning on the effective date based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) for all share-based
payments granted after the effective date and based on SFAS No. 123 for all awards granted to
employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date or (2) a  modified
retrospective  method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method, but also
permits entities to restate all periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption
based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS No. 123 for purposes of pro forma
disclosures. The Company plans to adopt SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method. In
April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a rule delaying the required adoption
date for SFAS No. 123(R) to the first interim period of the first fiscal year beginning on or after
June 15, 2005. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 123(R) as of April 1, 2006, the beginning of the
Company s fiscal year ending March 31, 2007. The Company is currently assessing various valuation
methods and will finalize its selection of a valuation method prior to adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).

As permitted by SFAS No. 123, we currently account for share-based payments to employees using
the APB Opinion No. 25 intrinsic value method and, as such, recognize no compensation cost for
employee stock options, as the exercise prices of options granted are equal to the quoted market
price of our common stock on the date of grant, except in limited circumstances when stock options
have been exchanged in a business combination. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) fair
value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations. The impact of adoption of
SFAS No. 123(R) cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based
payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) in prior periods, the
impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the
disclosure of pro forma net earnings (loss) and earnings (loss) per share in Note 1(l) to the
Company s audited financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2005, as filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax
deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow,
rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. In general, this
requirement would reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods
after adoption.

(6) Exit Activities and Related Costs 

FY2004 Plan 

During the year ended March 31, 2004, the Company implemented a plan (FY2004 Plan) that
included the involuntary termination of approximately 785 employees during that year. The workforce
reduction was across all functions and geographies and affected employees were provided cash
separation packages. The Company also exited leases in certain locations, reduced the square
footage required to operate some locations and relocated some operations to lower cost facilities.
The relocation efforts for the FY2004 Plan were completed as of December 31, 2003.

10

Table of Contents   

As of December 31, 2005, $28.2 million of severance and facilities costs related to
actions completed under the FY2004 Plan remained accrued for payment in future periods, as follows:

The FY2004 Plan amounts accrued at December 31, 2005 related to facilities costs
represent the remaining fair value of lease obligations for exited locations, as determined at the
cease-use dates of those facilities, net of estimated sublease income that could be reasonably
obtained in the future, and will be paid out over the remaining lease terms, the last of which ends
in fiscal 2011. The Company does not expect any significant additional severance or facilities
charges related to the FY2004 Plan subsequent to December 31, 2005. Accretion (the increase in the
present value of facilities accruals over time) and adjustments to original estimates are included
in operating expenses.

FY2006 Plan 

During the first quarter ended June 30, 2005, the Company implemented a plan (FY2006 Plan) to
reduce costs and realign resources to focus on growth areas. The FY2006 Plan included the
involuntary termination of 725 employees. The workforce reduction was across all functions and
geographies and affected employees were provided cash separation packages. The workforce reduction
has reduced selling and general and administrative expenses in product areas that are not realizing
the Company s profitability and growth goals. The Company also exited leases in certain locations,
which ultimately reduced the square footage and operating costs at these locations. The Company
does not expect any significant additional severance or facilities charges related to the FY2006
Plan subsequent to December 31, 2005. Accretion (the increase in the present value of facilities
accruals over time) and adjustments to the original estimates are included in operating expenses.
The net expense, with adjustments, for the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2005 related
to the FY2006 plan are as follows:

As of December 31, 2005, $1.7 million of severance and facilities costs related to
actions completed under the FY2006 Plan remained accrued for payment in future periods, as follows:

(7) Income Taxes 

The income tax expense for the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2004 was $13.1
million and $37.9 million, resulting in effective tax rates of 26.5% and 38.8%, respectively. The
income tax expense for the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2005 was $22.8 million
and $75.5 million, resulting in effective tax rates of 31.9% and 60.0%, respectively.

The Company s effective tax rate and associated provision for income taxes for the three
months and nine months ended December 31, 2004 and 2005 were based on our estimates of consolidated
earnings before taxes for fiscal 2005 and 2006, respectively. The effective tax rate is impacted by
the worldwide mix of estimated consolidated earnings before taxes, estimated tax credits, estimated
tax incentives and our assessment regarding the realizability of the Company s deferred tax assets.
Included in income tax expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2004, was a non-recurring
accrual of approximately $11.1 million to adjust the Company s aggregate net liabilities for income
taxes, withholding taxes and income tax exposures that were found to be understated after a
thorough analysis of all of the Company s income tax accounts in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.
Included in income tax expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2005, is a tax provision of
approximately $36.5 million related to the Company s adoption of a plan to repatriate approximately
$717.2 million of qualified earnings under the applicable provisions of the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004 (the Act), of which $625.0 million has been repatriated to date. The Act provides for a
special one-time tax deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated.

On December 15, 2005, the Company received a Revenue Agent s Report (RAR) from the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) that includes various proposed adjustments to the Company s US corporate
income taxes for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2002 and 2003. The Company has filed a protest
letter contesting the adjustments contained in the RAR and the Company expects to pursue additional
resolution of these adjustments with the IRS Appeals Division. The proposed adjustments primarily
deal with transfer pricing valuations and results between the Company and its foreign affiliates.

On October 28, 2005, the Israeli Tax Authorities ( ITA ) issued determination of assessments
(Assessments) to various Israeli affiliates of the Company that covered the 1998-2002 tax years.
The Israeli affiliates filed protests of the Assessments with the ITA
on December 15, 2005 and have
requested a hearing to pursue resolution of these Assessments with the ITA. The proposed
adjustments primarily deal with transfer pricing valuations and results between the Company and its
affiliates and the deductibility of various costs that directly and indirectly relate to the
acquisition of the Israeli affiliates.

The Company s income tax provision includes amounts that are intended to cover taxes that are
probable and can be reasonably estimated, including amounts associated with the RAR and the
Assessments. The actual resolutions of these income tax audits could lead to income tax expense or
benefit that is materially different from the amounts provided for in the financial statements as
presented.

During the quarter, we filed a writ of mandamus in Brazil in order to clarify whether or not a
tax applies to the remittance of software payments from our Brazilian operations. In response to
the filing, the first level Court denied our request for preliminary injunction, but the merits of
the case were not yet analyzed. We believe that we will prevail in this matter and intend to
continue to pursue a favorable outcome. We do not expect a resolution in the near term.

(8) Commitments and Contingencies 

Guarantees 

FASB Interpretation No. 45,  Guarantor s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,  (FIN 45) requires certain
guarantees to be recorded at fair value and requires a guarantor to make disclosures, even when the
likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote. For those guarantees and
indemnifications that do not fall within the initial recognition and measurement requirements of
FIN 45, the Company must continue to monitor the conditions that are subject to the guarantees and
indemnifications, as required under existing generally accepted accounting principles, to identify
if a loss has been incurred. If the Company determines that it is probable that a loss has been
incurred, any such estimable loss would be recognized. The initial recognition and measurement
requirements do not apply to the Company s product warranties or to the provisions contained in the
majority of the Company s software license agreements that

12

Table of Contents   

indemnify licensees of the Company s software from damages and costs resulting from claims
alleging that the Company s software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party.
The Company has historically received only a limited number of requests for payment under these
provisions and has not been required to make material payments pursuant to these provisions. The
Company has not identified any losses that are probable under these provisions and, accordingly,
the Company has not recorded a liability related to these indemnification provisions. BMC
Software, Inc. also guarantees the performance of certain of its subsidiaries for certain
customers. If such a subsidiary fails to meet its contractual obligations as they come due, the
guarantor has an unconditional obligation to perform on its behalf. No additional liability has
been recorded for these guarantees because the subsidiaries  obligations are properly accounted for
as costs of operations as services are provided and liabilities as obligations are incurred.

Leases 

During the year ended March 31, 2004, the Company entered into a 48-month capital lease for
computer hardware. During the year ended March 31, 2005, additional computer hardware was
incorporated into this capital lease. During the quarter ended December 31, 2005, BMC modified the
lease to upgrade certain equipment, which extended the lease term for 36 months. The $7.3 million
current portion of the obligation for the capital lease is reflected in the consolidated balance
sheet as of December 31, 2005 as an accrued liability, and the $10.7 million long-term portion of
the obligation is reflected as an other long-term liability. Depreciation of the computer hardware
under the capital lease is included in depreciation expense in the consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the quarters ended December 31, 2004 and 2005.
Future minimum lease payments to be made under capital leases as of December 31, 2005 are $3.8
million in fiscal 2006, $10.1 million in fiscal 2007, $6.1 million in fiscal 2008 and $3.4 million
thereafter.

(9) Tradenames 

Under the purchase accounting method for acquisitions, portions of the purchase prices for the
Company s acquisitions were allocated to other intangible assets, including tradenames. Through
March 31, 2005, most of the Company s acquired tradenames were not amortized because the assets
were deemed to have indefinite remaining useful lives. As a result of a recently initiated
re-branding campaign, the Company changed the estimated economic useful lives, effective April 1,
2005, of acquired tradenames from indefinite to between one and two years. The carrying amount of
the previously unamortized tradenames at March 31, 2005 was $25.2 million and is being amortized on
a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated useful life commencing April 1, 2005. The
pre-tax increase in amortization expense for tradenames resulting from this change in estimate for
the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2005 was $3.5 million and $9.9 million,
respectively. The after-tax effect of the increase in amortization expense for tradenames for the
three months ended December 31, 2005 on net earnings of $2.9 million decreased basic and diluted
earnings per share by $0.01. For the nine months ended December 31, 2005, the after-tax effect of
the increase in amortization expense for tradenames on net earnings of $8.1 million decreased basic
and diluted earnings per share by $0.04.

Overview 

BMC Software is one of the world s largest independent software vendors. Delivering Business
Service Management (BSM), we provide software solutions that empower companies to manage their
information technology (IT) infrastructure from a business perspective. Our extensive portfolio of
software solutions spans enterprise systems, applications, databases and service management.

For the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2005, our diluted earnings per share was
$0.22 and $0.23 per share, respectively, as compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.16 and
$0.27 per share, respectively for the same periods in the prior year. The increase in the
quarterly diluted earnings per share is driven by lower operating expenses during the quarter ended
December 31, 2005, as a result of our recent restructuring activities pertaining to the FY2006 Plan
as described in note 6 herein. The decrease in the diluted earnings per share for the nine months
ended December 31, 2005, compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2004, is due to the tax
provision for repatriated earnings as described in note 7 herein and the restructuring charges from
the FY2006 plan as described in note 6 herein, partially offset by higher revenues and lower
operating expenses resulting from our recent restructuring activities pertaining to the FY2006
Plan. Our license revenues during the quarter ended December 31, 2005 were $135.0 million, as
compared to $161.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in license
revenues is attributed to fewer license transactions during the third
quarter combined with a significant increase in the percentage of
transactions where license revenue is deferred. The
restructuring actions associated with the FY2006 Plan have had a negative short-term impact on our
license revenues. As part of the restructuring, we have redeployed our sales resources and are
selling a more strategic type of solution to higher-level executives, frequently at the CIO level.
This has resulted in a longer sales cycle and lower closure rates. However, we expect this change
to ultimately improve our sales closure success. Our maintenance revenues during the quarter ended
December 31, 2005 were $224.2 million, as compared to $202.2 million for the quarter ended December
31, 2004. Maintenance revenues increased primarily as a result of the additional revenue associated
with acquired products and the continuing growth in the base of installed Service Management
products. We maintained a strong balance sheet with cash and cash equivalents and marketable
securities at December 31, 2005 of $1,173.5 million. Cash flows generated by operations for the
nine months ended December 31, 2005 were $151.7 million compared to $227.7 million in the same
prior year period. This decrease is primarily due to the FY2006 Plan restructuring payments and
tax payments for repatriated earnings. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we spent
approximately $100.0 million to repurchase approximately 4.9 million shares of our common stock.
In November 2005, in light of the depletion of previously authorized repurchases, the Board of
Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional $1.0 billion of its common
stock. As of December 31, 2005, there was approximately $934.4 million remaining available under
the repurchase authorization.

Industry Conditions 

The worldwide market for spending on IT solutions remains challenging. IT organizations
continue to be pressured by their business counterparts to lower overall operational costs while
increasing support for regulatory compliance, strategic objectives and other projects focused on
delivering increased value to the business. Our BSM solutions deliver unique capabilities to our
customers, allowing them to improve their IT processes and effectively align IT with business
needs. While we believe BSM differentiates us from our competitors, we recognize that the systems
management software marketplace is highly competitive. A more detailed discussion of these
competitive pressures can be found under   Certain Risks and Uncertainties   in our report on Form
10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2005.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an
on-going basis, we make and evaluate estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue
recognition, capitalized software development costs, acquired technology, in-process research and
development, goodwill and intangible assets, valuation of investments and accounting for income
taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances; the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about amounts and timing of revenues and expenses, the carrying values of assets, and the
recorded amounts of liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or
assumptions change. We have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting
policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed
our related disclosures. The critical accounting policies related to the estimates and judgments
listed above are discussed further in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2005 under
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. There have
been no changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended December 31, 2005.

Certain amounts previously reported have been reclassified to provide comparability among the
periods reported. Those reclassifications did not impact our net earnings or stockholders  equity.

Results of Operations and Financial Condition 

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentages that selected items
in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income bear to total
revenues. These financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results.

Revenues 

We generate revenues from licensing software, providing maintenance, enhancement and support
for previously licensed products and providing professional services. We generally utilize written
contracts as the means to establish the terms and conditions by which our products, support and
services are sold to our customers.

Product Line License Revenues

Product Line Maintenance Revenues  

Total Product Line Revenues  

Our solutions are broadly divided into four core product categories. The Mainframe
Management product category includes products designed for managing database management systems on
mainframe platforms. The Distributed Systems Management product category includes our systems
management and monitoring, distributed data management, scheduling and output management solutions.
The Service Management product category includes our service, change and asset management
solutions, IT discovery and software configuration management solutions. The Identity Management
product category includes products that facilitate user administration and provisioning, password
administration, enterprise directory management, web access control and audit and compliance
management.

Mainframe Management license revenues represented 29.8%, or $40.2 million, and 32.5%, or
$119.1 million, of our total license revenues for the quarter and nine months ended December 31,
2005, compared to 37.6%, or $60.6 million, and 36.2%, or $142.6 million, for the quarter and nine
months ended December 31, 2004, respectively. For the quarter ended December 31, 2005, Mainframe
Management license revenues decreased 33.7%, or $20.4 million, from the comparable prior year period
due to a decrease in Mainframe Management license transactions, caused primarily by a much larger
percentage of the transactions over $1 million recognized upfront in the prior year. For the nine
months ended December 31, 2005, Mainframe Management license revenues decreased 16.5%, or $23.5
million, primarily attributed to the revenue recognized upfront during the prior year s third
quarter. Mainframe Management maintenance revenues represented 36.7%, or $82.3 million,
and 36.9%, or $243.6 million, of our total maintenance revenues for the quarter and nine months
ended December 31, 2005, compared to 36.5%, or $73.9 million, and

16

Table of Contents   

37.4%, or $226.8 million, for the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2004,
respectively. Total maintenance revenues for Mainframe Management increased 11.4% in the quarter
and 7.4% for the nine months ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same periods in the prior year
due to our installed base of mainframe customers, partially offset by the decline in annual
transactions closed.

Distributed Systems Management license revenues represented 29.3%, or $39.6 million, and
30.5%, or $111.7 million, of our total license revenues for the quarter and nine months ended
December 31, 2005, respectively, compared to 32.0%, or $51.5 million, and 32.2%, or $127.1 million, for the
quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2004, respectively. Total license revenues for this
group decreased 23.1% and 12.1% for the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2005 from the
same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of a decrease in license transactions year
over year. Distributed Systems Management maintenance revenues
represented 31.9%, or $71.6 million of
our total maintenance revenues for the quarter and 32.0%, or $211.2 million, for the nine months
ended December 31, 2005, compared to 33.6%, or $67.9 million, and 33.9%, or $205.6 million, for the
quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2004, respectively. Total maintenance revenues for this
group increased 5.4% and 2.7% for the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2005 from the same
period in the prior year due to our installed base of distributed
systems customers, partially offset by the
decline in annual license transactions closed.

Service Management license revenues represented 39.3%, or $53.1 million, and 35.1%, or $128.7
million, of our total license revenues for the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2005,
compared to 28.2%, or $45.4 million, and 29.9%, or $117.8 million, for the quarter and nine months
ended December 31, 2004, respectively. Total license revenues for Service Management increased
17.0% for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, from the same periods in the prior year due to a
growth in license transactions. Year to date
license revenues increased 9.3% compared to the prior year due to a growth in year to date license
transactions, which was negatively impacted by second quarter sales performance during the current
year. Service Management maintenance revenues represented 29.2%, or $65.4 million, and 28.9%, or
$190.6 million, of our total maintenance revenues for the quarter and nine months ended December
31, 2005, respectively, compared to 28.0%, or $56.6 million, and 26.9%, or $163.2 million, for the quarter and
nine months ended December 31, 2004, respectively. Total Service Management maintenance revenues
increased 15.5% and 16.8% for the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2005, from the same
periods in the prior year due to an increase in installed customer base as well as a high renewal rate.

Identity Management license revenues represented 1.6%, or $2.1 million, and 1.8%, or $6.7
million, of our total license revenues for the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2005,
respectively, compared to 2.2%, or $3.5 million, and 1.6%, or $6.3 million, for the quarter and
nine months ended December 31, 2004. Identity Management maintenance revenues represented 2.2%, or
$4.9 million, and 2.1%, or $13.9 million, of our total maintenance revenues for the quarter and
nine months ended December 31, 2005, respectively, compared to 1.9%, or $3.8 million, for the
quarter and 1.9%, or $11.3 million, for the nine months ended December 31, 2004. Given the relative
small size of the Identity Management business unit, any large deal in a particular period can skew
the periodic growth rates for license revenue. Maintenance revenue for Identity Management has
maintained a strong growth rate due to the cumulative increase in its install base as well as
continued maintenance renewals.

Product License Revenues 

Our product license revenues primarily consist of fees related to products licensed to
customers on a perpetual basis. Product license fees can be associated with a customer s licensing
of a given software product for the first time or with a customer s purchase of the right to run a
previously licensed product on additional computing capacity or for additional users. Our license
revenues also include term license fees which are generated when customers are granted license
rights to a given software product for a defined period of time.

License revenues decreased 16.1% and 7.0% for the quarter and nine months ended December 31,
2005, compared to the same periods last year. The decrease in license revenue is the combined
result of a decrease in total bookings and a decrease in the percentage of new license sales
recognized upfront. Recognized license revenues plus the net change in deferred license revenues
for the period, representing the license value of transactions completed in the period, decreased
during the quarter and the nine months ended December 31, 2005 compared to the prior year periods.
The number of license transactions over $1 million that closed during the quarter decreased to 19
from 25 in the prior year period, of which there was one transaction over $10 million in both
periods. The total license value of these 19 transactions was $56.7 million, including amounts
recognized and deferred, compared to $78.7 million for the 25 transactions in the comparable prior
year period. The remaining transactions sold during this quarter compared to the same quarter in
the prior year remain consistent. Of the current period transactions, the percentage of revenue
recognized upfront has decreased from 65% a year ago to 51% during the quarter, which is indicative
of an increase in the number of term contracts. Term contracts are time-based arrangements which
allow the licensee or customer to use our software for a specified period of time. Thus, the
associated value of the contract is recognized ratably over the life of the contract.

17

Table of Contents   

For the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, our recognized license
revenues were impacted by the changes in our deferred license revenue balance as follows:

The primary reasons for license revenue deferrals include customer transactions that
contain certain complex contractual terms and conditions, customer transactions for products that
have different maintenance pricing methodologies, such as arrangements which include the right to
license both Remedy products and other BMC Software products, time-based licenses which are
recognized over the term of the arrangement, customer transactions which include products with
differing maintenance periods and other transactions for which we do not have or are not able to
determine vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair value of the maintenance and/or
professional services. All of these instances cause the license revenues to be deferred under the
residual method of accounting for multiple element arrangements. The contract terms and conditions
that result in deferral of revenue recognition for a given transaction result from arm s length
negotiations between us and our customers. We anticipate our transactions will continue to include
such contract terms that result in deferral of the related license revenues as we expand our
offerings to meet customers  product, pricing and licensing needs.

Once it is determined that license revenue for a particular contract must be deferred, based
on the contractual terms and application of revenue recognition policies to those terms, we
recognize such license revenue either ratably over the term of the contract or when the revenue
recognition criteria are met. Because of this, we generally know the timing of the subsequent
recognition of license revenue at the time of deferral. Therefore, the amount of license revenues
to be recognized out of the deferred revenue balance in each future quarter is generally
predictable, and our total license revenues to be recognized each quarter become more predictable
as a larger percentage of those revenues come from the deferred license revenue balance. As of
December 31, 2005, the deferred license revenue balance was $419.8 million and had an average
remaining life of approximately three years. As additional license revenues are deferred in future
periods, the amounts to be recognized in future periods will increase. A summary of the estimated
deferred license revenues we expect to recognize in future periods as of December 31, 2005 are as
follows (in millions):

Maintenance, Enhancement and Support Revenues 

Maintenance, enhancement and support revenues represent the ratable recognition of fees to
enroll licensed products in our software maintenance, enhancement and support program. Maintenance,
enhancement and support enrollment generally entitles customers to product enhancements, technical
support services and ongoing compatibility with third-party operating systems, database management
systems, networks, storage systems and applications. These fees are generally charged annually and
are based on the discounted license list price for legacy BMC Software products and a percentage of
the undiscounted license list price for Service Management and Identity Management products.
Customers are generally entitled to reduced annual maintenance percentages for entering into
long-term maintenance contracts that include prepayment of the maintenance fees or that are
supported by a formal financing arrangement. The majority of our maintenance revenues are generated
by such long-term contracts. Maintenance revenues also include the ratable recognition of the
bundled fees for any initial maintenance services covered by the related license agreement.

Maintenance revenues can have quarterly fluctuations based on the timing of contracts, renewal
rates and the number of new license contracts. Maintenance fees increase with new license and
maintenance agreements and as existing customers install our products on additional processing
capacity or add users. However, discounts on licensed products tend to increase for purchases with
higher levels of processing capacity, so that maintenance fees on a per unit of capacity basis are
typically reduced in enterprise license agreements. These discounts, combined with an increase in
long-term maintenance contracts with reduced maintenance percentages

18

Table of Contents   

and the number of new license contracts, excluding our Service Management products, have led
to lower growth rates for our maintenance revenues.

Maintenance revenues increased 10.9% and 8.6% for the quarter and nine months ended December
31, 2005, over the comparable prior year periods, primarily as a result of the additional
maintenance revenue associated the continuing growth in the base of installed Service Management
products.

As of December 31, 2005, the deferred maintenance revenue balance was $1,119.4 million. As
additional maintenance revenues are deferred in future periods, the amounts to be recognized in
future periods will increase. A summary of the estimated deferred maintenance revenues we expect
to recognize in future periods as of December 31, 2005 are as follows (in millions):

Domestic vs. International Revenues 

Our domestic operations generated 42.7%, or $68.8 million, and 48.3%, or $65.2 million,
of license revenues for the quarters ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively. For the
nine-month periods ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, domestic operations generated 44.9%, or $176.8
million, and 49.2%, or $180.3 million, of license revenues, respectively.

For the quarter ended December 31, 2005, domestic license revenue decreased 5.2% compared to
the same period in the prior year primarily due to a 30.1%, or
$6.5 million, decline in Distributed Systems partially offset by
a 24.0%, or $5.6 million, growth in Service
Management which is our largest product line as well as the highest
growth product line. For the nine months ended
December 31, 2005, domestic license revenue increased 2.0% compared to the comparable period in the
prior fiscal year due to a 9.6%, or $5.2 million, growth in Mainframe Management which is primarily
attributable to several large transactions for which license revenue
was recognized ratably that closed in the second quarter of fiscal
2005, thereby providing two more quarters of revenues in fiscal 2006,
as well as a 17.1%, or $10.5
million, growth in Service Management, offset by a 21.0%, or $12.2 million, decline in Distributed
Systems.

International license revenues represented 57.3%, or $92.2 million, and 51.7%, or $69.8
million, of license revenues for the quarters ended December 31, 2004 and 2005. For the nine-month
periods ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, international revenues represented 55.1%, or $217.0
million, and 50.8%, or $185.9 million, of license revenues, respectively. International license
revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 decreased 24.3% compared to the same quarter last
year due to approximately $17 million of Mainframe transactions that were recognized upfront in the
prior year and a 16.1%, or $4.7 million, decline in Distributed Systems Management. For the nine
months ended December 31, 2005, international license revenue decreased 14.3% compared to the same
period last year primarily attributed to the decrease in Mainframe Management and moderate changes
across the other business units.

Table of Contents   

Our domestic operations generated 56.1%, or $113.4 million, and 55.7%, or $124.9 million, of
maintenance revenues for the quarters ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively; our
international operations generated 43.9%, or $88.8 million, and 44.3%, or $99.3 million, of
maintenance revenues for the same periods. For the nine months ended December 31, 2004 and 2005,
domestic operations generated 56.1%, or $340.2 million, and 55.8%, or $368.0 million, of
maintenance revenues, respectively. For these same periods, international operations generated
43.9%, or $266.7 million, and 44.2%, or $291.3 million, of
maintenance revenues, respectively. The growth rate for
maintenance is consistent for the domestic and international operations.

Foreign currency exchange rate changes, including the impact of hedging, resulted in an
unfavorable impact to the growth in international license revenues of 1.5%, or $1.4 million, and
0.2%, or $0.4 million, for the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the
prior year periods.

Professional Services Revenues 

Professional services revenues, representing fees from implementation, integration and
education services performed during the periods, decreased 10.6% and 3.3% for the quarter and nine
months ended December 31, 2005, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. Domestic
professional services revenue for the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2005 decreased
4.0% and 9.0%, respectively, and is primarily attributable to a strategic shift to focus on large,
leading edge BSM implementations which will result in lower contract volume, but higher contract
values in the future. International professional services revenue for the quarter decreased 15.3%
and increased 1.3% for the nine months ended December 31, 2005 due to a delay in completing a
number of large projects that are based on completed contract revenue recognition.

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses for the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2005 include exit
activity costs pertaining to the FY2006 Plan as shown in the following table and described in note
6 herein.

Excluding the costs associated with the exit activities and related FY2006 plan costs, as
described below, total operating expenses decreased 10.0%, or $36.3 million, and 5.1%, or $52.8
million, for the three and nine month periods ended December 31 2005, compared to the prior year
periods. As a result of the restructuring, we are now recognizing significant cost savings.

Exit Activities and Related Costs 

FY2004 Plan 

During the year ended March 31, 2004, the Company implemented a plan (FY2004 Plan) that
included the involuntary termination of approximately 785 employees during that year. The workforce
reduction was across all functions and geographies and affected employees were provided cash
separation packages. The Company also exited leases in certain locations, reduced the square
footage required to operate some locations and relocated some operations to lower cost facilities.
The relocation efforts for the FY2004 Plan were completed as of December 31, 2003.

As of December 31, 2005, $28.2 million of severance and facilities costs related to actions
completed under the FY2004 Plan remained accrued for payment in future periods, as follows:

20

Table of Contents   

The FY2004 Plan amounts accrued at December 31, 2005 related to facilities costs
represent the remaining fair value of lease obligations for exited locations, as determined at the
cease-use dates of those facilities, net of estimated sublease income that could be reasonably
obtained in the future, and will be paid out over the remaining lease terms, the last of which ends
in fiscal 2011. We do not expect any significant additional severance or facilities charges related
to the FY2004 Plan subsequent to December 31, 2005 other than potential adjustments to lease
accruals based on actual subleases differing from estimates. Accretion (the increase in the present
value of facilities accruals over time) and adjustments to original estimates are included in
operating expenses.

FY2006 Plan 

During the first quarter ended June 30, 2005, we implemented a plan (FY2006 Plan) to reduce
costs and realign resources to focus on growth areas. The FY2006 Plan included the involuntary
termination of 725 employees. The workforce reduction was across all functions and geographies and
affected employees were provided cash separation packages. The workforce reduction has reduced
selling and general and administrative expenses in product areas that are not realizing our
profitability and growth goals. We do not expect any significant additional severance or
facilities charges related to the FY2006 Plan subsequent to December 31, 2005. Accretion (the
increase in the present value of facilities accruals over time) and adjustments to the original
estimates are included in operating expenses. The net expense, with adjustments, for the quarter
and nine months ended December 31, 2005 related to the FY2006 plan are as follows:

Table of Contents   

We expect that the actions taken will allow us to increase investment in our Service
Management business, which we believe will provide us future revenue growth, maintain our strong
profitability in our Mainframe Management business and improve our profitability in our Distributed
Systems Management business. Combining the expected annual cost savings from these actions and the
increased investment in growth areas, we estimate that we will achieve an annual expense reduction
of approximately $100 million relative to our projected operating expenses before our restructuring
activities.

Cost of License Revenues 

Cost of license revenues is primarily comprised of (i) the amortization of capitalized
software costs for internally developed products, (ii) amortization of purchased software included
in internally developed products, (iii) amortization of acquired technology for products acquired
through business combinations, (iv) license-based royalties to third parties and (v) production and
distribution costs for initial product licenses. For the quarters ended December 31, 2004 and 2005,
the cost of license revenues represented 8.3% and 7.4% of total
revenues, respectively, and 19.9%
and 20.9% of license revenues, respectively. For the nine months ended December 31, 2004 and
2005, the cost of license revenues represented 9.0% and 8.7% of total revenues, respectively, and
24.5% and 25.8% of license revenues, respectively. The cost of license revenues decreased 12.1%
for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 and 1.9% for the nine months ended December 31, 2005,
compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily as a result of the conclusion of
amortization of certain acquired technologies as well as headcount reductions incurred during
fiscal 2006 relating to the FY2006 Plan, as described in  Exit Activities and Related Costs . While
there has been a shift of focus from maintenance to development efforts, an increase in cost of
license revenues is not seen until projects are released to market and amortization begins. The
decrease in the cost of license revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2005, is primarily
as a result of headcount reductions incurred during fiscal 2006 relating to the FY2006 Plan,
partially offset by the amortization of acquired technology from the acquisition of Marimba and
Viadyne in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, as compared to the year earlier period.

As discussed in note 1(f) to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended
March 31, 2005, contained in our annual report on Form 10-K, we capitalize software development
costs in accordance with SFAS No. 86,  Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold,
Leased, or Otherwise Marketed.  The following table summarizes the amounts capitalized and
amortized during the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2004 and 2005. Amortization for
these periods includes amounts accelerated for certain software products that were not expected to
generate sufficient future revenues to realize the carrying value of the assets.

Cost of Maintenance Revenues 

Cost of maintenance revenues is primarily comprised of the costs associated with the customer
support and research and development personnel that provide maintenance, enhancement and support
services to our customers. For the quarters ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, the cost of
maintenance revenues represented 12.0% and 10.3% of total revenues,
respectively, and 22.9% and
17.4% of maintenance revenues, respectively. For the nine months ended December 31, 2004 and
2005, the cost of maintenance revenues represented 12.7% and 11.3% of
total revenues, respectively,
and 22.3% and 18.7% of maintenance revenues, respectively. The cost of maintenance revenues
decreased 15.7% and 8.9% for the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2005, respectively,
primarily as a result of decreased personnel costs relating to the FY2006 Plan as described in  Exit
Activities and Related Costs , and a shift in focus from maintenance to development efforts, as
compared to the year earlier periods.

Cost of Professional Services 

Cost of professional services consists primarily of personnel costs and third-party fees
associated with implementation, integration and education services that we provide to our
customers, and the related infrastructure to support this business. For the quarters ended
December 31, 2004 and 2005, the cost of professional services revenues represented 6.4% and 5.3% of
total revenues, respectively For the nine months ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, the cost of
professional services revenues represented 6.4% and 5.9% of total revenues, respectively The cost
of professional services revenues decreased 18.9% in the quarter ended December 31, 2005 compared
to the quarter ended December 31, 2004, primarily as a result of decreased personnel costs relating
to the FY2006 Plan as described in  Exit Activities and Related Costs,  as compared to the year
earlier periods. The cost of professional services revenues decreased 6.3% for the nine months
ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2004, primarily as a
result of lower ongoing personnel costs, partially offset by the one-time severance costs under the
FY2006 Plan as described in  Exit Activities and Related Costs  above.

Selling and Marketing 

Our selling and marketing expenses primarily include personnel and related costs, sales
commissions and costs associated with advertising, industry trade shows and sales seminars. For
the quarters ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, selling and marketing costs represented 37.7% and
33.0% of total revenues, respectively, and decreased 13.9% from the year earlier period. This
decrease is attributed to the FY2006 Plan described in  Exit Activities and Related Costs.  For the
nine months ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, selling and marketing expenses represented 37.6% and
35.4% of total revenues, respectively, and decreased 3.9% from the year earlier period. This
decrease is primarily due to lower ongoing personnel costs, partially offset by the one-time
severance costs incurred early in fiscal 2006 relating to the FY2006 Plan. For the quarters and
nine months ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, commission expense was impacted by the changes in our
deferred commissions balance (i.e., the net impact of new commissions deferred and commissions
recognized out of the deferred balance) as follows:

Research and Development 

Research and development expenses mainly comprise personnel costs related to software
developers and development support personnel, including software programmers, testing and quality
assurance personnel and writers of technical documentation such as product manuals and installation
guides. These expenses also include computer hardware/software costs, telecommunications and
personnel expenses necessary to maintain our data processing center. Research, development and
support expenses represented 13.8% and 14.6% of total revenues for the quarters ended December 31,
2004 and 2005, respectively, and represented 14.6% and 15.5% of total revenues for the nine months
ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Research, development and support expenses
increased 3.7% and 7.9% in the quarter and nine month periods ended December 31, 2005,
respectively, as compared to the same periods a year earlier primarily due to a shift in focus from
maintenance to development efforts, which can result in higher research and development expenses if
a project is not yet eligible for capitalization.

General and Administrative 

General and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of compensation and personnel
costs within executive management, finance and accounting, IT, facilities management, legal and
human resources. Other costs included in general and administrative expenses are fees paid for
outside legal and accounting services, consulting projects and severance pertaining to exit
activities and related costs. General and administrative expenses
represented 14.6% and 13.4% of
total revenues in the quarters ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, and 13.7% and 14.4% for the nine
months ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively. These expenses decreased 9.1% for the
quarter ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to
lower professional fees, consisting of legal, accounting and consulting fees associated with our
Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance, partially offset by severance costs. For the three months
ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same period in the prior year, we incurred approximately
$2.9 million less in third party fees associated with our
initial year Sarbanes-Oxley compliance
efforts. General and administrative expenses increased 7.9% for the nine months ended December 31,
2005, as compared to the nine months

ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to costs relating to the FY2006 Plan as described in
 Exit Activities and Related Costs  and severance costs incurred during the current quarter ,  as well
as, professional fees, consisting of legal, accounting and consulting fees associated with our
Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance. For the nine months ended December 31, 2005 compared to the
same period in the prior year, we incurred approximately $7.7 million more of third party fees
associated with our initial year Sarbanes-Oxley compliance efforts, with the majority of this
increase incurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2006.

Amortization of Intangibles 

Under the purchase accounting method for acquisitions, portions of the purchase prices for our
acquisitions were allocated to other intangible assets, including tradenames. Through March 31,
2005, most of our acquired tradenames were not amortized because the assets were deemed to have
indefinite remaining useful lives. However, as a result of a recently initiated re-branding
campaign, we changed the estimated economic useful lives, effective April 1, 2005, of acquired
tradenames from indefinite to between one and two years. The carrying amount of the previously
unamortized tradenames at March 31, 2005 was $25.2 million and is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over the remaining estimated useful life commencing April 1, 2005. For the
quarter ended December 31, 2005, the pre-tax increase in amortization expense resulting from this
change in estimate was $3.5 million, partially offset by the conclusion of amortization of certain
other intangibles. For the quarter ended December 31, 2005, the amortization of intangibles had a
$2.9 million after-tax effect on net earnings and decreased basic and diluted earnings per share by
$0.01. For the nine months ended December 31, 2005, the pre-tax increase in amortization expense
resulting from this change in estimate was $9.9 million, partially offset by the conclusion of
amortization of certain other intangibles. The after-tax effect of the increase in amortization
expense for tradenames for the nine months ended December 31,
2005 on net earnings of $8.1 million
decreased basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.04. For the quarter ended December 31, 2004,
amortization of intangibles was $5.5 million, as compared to $8.2 million for the quarter ended
December 31, 2005. For the nine months ended December 31, 2004, amortization of intangibles was
$14.9 million, as compared to $26.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2005.

Other Income, Net 

Other income, net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents, marketable
securities and finance receivables, rental income on owned facilities and gains and losses on
marketable securities and other investments. For the quarter and nine months ended December 31,
2005, other income, net, was $19.0 million and $56.0 million, respectively, reflecting a decrease
of $8.0 million and $4.3 million from each of the same periods in the prior fiscal year. Both
decreases from prior year amounts are due primarily to an $8.0 million gain realized on the sale of
previously securitized finance receivables in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, with the
year-to-date decline partially offset by higher interest income generated from higher average
investment portfolio balances receiving higher rates.

Income Taxes 

The income tax expense for the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2004 was $13.1
million and $37.9 million, resulting in effective tax rates of 26.5% and 38.8%, respectively. The
income tax expense for the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2005 was $22.8 million
and $75.5 million, resulting in effective tax rates of 31.9% and 60.0%, respectively.

Our effective tax rate and associated provision for income taxes for the three months and nine
months ended December 31, 2004 and 2005 were based on our estimates of consolidated earnings before
taxes for fiscal 2005 and 2006, respectively. The effective tax rate is impacted by the worldwide
mix of estimated consolidated earnings before taxes, estimated tax credits, estimated tax
incentives and our assessment regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Included in
income tax expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2004, was a non-recurring accrual of
approximately $11.1 million to adjust our aggregate net liabilities for income taxes, withholding
taxes and income tax exposures that were found to be understated after a thorough analysis of all
of our income tax accounts in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Included in income tax expense for
the nine months ended December 31, 2005, is a tax provision of approximately $36.5 million related
to our adoption of a plan to repatriate approximately $717.2 million of qualified earnings under
the applicable provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, of which $625.0 million has
been repatriated to date. The Act provides for a special one-time tax deduction of 85% of certain
foreign earnings that are repatriated.

On December 15, 2005, the Company received a Revenue Agent s Report (RAR) from the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) that includes various proposed adjustments to the Company s US corporate
income taxes for our fiscal years ended March 31, 2002 and 2003. We have filed a protest letter
contesting the adjustments contained in the RAR and we expect to pursue additional resolution of
these adjustments with the IRS Appeals Division. The proposed adjustments primarily deal with
transfer pricing valuations and results between the Company and its foreign affiliates.

24

Table of Contents   

On October 28, 2005, the Israeli Tax Authorities ( ITA ) issued determination of assessments
(Assessments) to various Israeli affiliates of the Company that covered the 1998-2002 tax years.
The Israeli affiliates filed protests of the Assessments with the ITA
on December 15, 2005 and have
requested a hearing to pursue resolution of these Assessments with the ITA. The proposed
adjustments primarily deal with transfer pricing valuations and results between the Company and its
affiliates and the deductibility of various costs that directly and indirectly relate to the
acquisition of the Israeli affiliates.

Our income tax provision includes amounts that are intended to cover taxes that are probable
and estimable including amounts associated with the RAR and the
Assessments. The actual resolutions
of these income tax audits could lead to income tax expense or benefit that is materially different
from the amounts provided for in the financial statements as presented.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 03-1,
 The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.  EITF
Issue No. 03-1 provides guidance on evaluating other-than-temporary impairment for marketable debt
and equity securities accounted for under SFAS No. 115,  Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities,  as well as non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the cost
method. The consensus includes a basic three-step model to evaluate whether an investment is
other-than-temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No.
EITF Issue 03-1-1,  Effective Date of Paragraphs 10   20 of EITF Issue No. 03-1,  The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments .  This FSP delays the
effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in EITF Issue No. 03-1 until
the FASB staff provides applicable implementation guidance. In July 2005, the FASB decided not to
provide additional guidance on the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and issued proposed
FSP EITF 03-1-a,  Implementation Guidance for the Application of Paragraph 16 of EITF Issue No.
03-1,  as final (the FASB retitled this FSP as FSP FAS 115-1 and 124-1,  The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments  and posted the FSP on
November 3, 2005). The final FSP supersedes EITF Issue No. 03-1,  The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.  The final FSP replaces
the guidance set forth in paragraphs 10 through 18 of EITF Issue 03-1 with references to existing
other-than-temporary impairment guidance, such as SFAS No. 115 .  FSP FAS 115-1 and 124-1 clarifies
that an investor should recognize an impairment loss no later than when the impairment is deemed
other-than-temporary, even if a decision to sell has not been made. FSP FAS 115-1and 124-1 shall be
applied to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not expect the new guidance
to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R),  Share-Based Payment,  which is a revision
of SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 and amends SFAS No. 95,  Statement
of Cash Flows.  Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in
SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including
grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their
fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. SFAS No. 123(R) permits adoption
using one of two methods: (1) a  modified prospective  method in which compensation cost is
recognized beginning on the effective date based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) for all
share-based payments granted after the effective date and based on SFAS No. 123 for all awards
granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date or (2)
a  modified retrospective  method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective
method, but also permits entities to restate all periods presented or prior interim periods of the
year of adoption based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS No. 123 for purposes of pro
forma disclosures. The Company plans to adopt SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective
method. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a rule delaying the required
adoption date for SFAS No. 123(R) to the first interim period of the first fiscal year beginning on
or after June 15, 2005. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 123(R) as of April 1, 2006, the beginning
of our fiscal year ending March 31, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No.
123(R) on our financial position and results of operations.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,  Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets,  as an
amendment of APB Opinion No. 29,  Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions.  This Statement
addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets. It eliminates the exception from fair
value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in APB Opinion No. 29 and
replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. This Statement
specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the
entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. The provisions of this
Statement are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after
June 15, 2005 and must be applied prospectively. We do not expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 153
will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,  Accounting Changes and Error Corrections   a
replacement of APB No. 20 and FAS No. 3.  This Statement changes the requirements for the
accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. It

25

Table of Contents   

applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and to those changes required by an
accounting pronouncement when such a pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions.
SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods  financial statements of changes
in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects
or the cumulative effect of the change. This Statement shall be effective for accounting changes
and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. This Statement
does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements, including
those that are in a transition phase as of the effective date of this Statement.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The financial data utilized in analyzing our liquidity and financial position is summarized in
the tables below:

Operating Activities  

The table below aggregates certain line items from our condensed consolidated statements of
cash flows to present the key items affecting our cash flows from operating activities:

The most significant components of adjustments to net earnings for items whose cash
effects are investing or financing cash flows is depreciation and amortization, as follows: 

For the nine months ended December 31, 2005, the increase in adjustments to net
earnings for items whose cash effects are investing or financing cash flows is primarily
due to the increase in amortization for the period. The increase in

26

Table of Contents   

amortization of intangible assets is a result of a recently initiated re-branding campaign,
whereby we changed the estimated economic useful lives, effective April 1, 2005, of our
acquired tradenames from indefinite to between one and two years, and are reporting the
change prospectively as a change in estimate. See discussion in  Amortization of Intangibles 
above.

For the nine months ended December 31, 2005, the decrease in finance receivables is
primarily due to cash collections and sold receivables exceeding new receivables. 

The main component of other cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended
December 31, 2005 is a decrease in deferred revenues, which does not impact total operating
cash flows as the offset is in earnings. 

We continue to finance our operations primarily through funds generated from operations. Our
primary source of cash is the sale of our software licenses, software maintenance and professional
services. We believe that our existing cash balances and funds generated from operating and
investing activities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable
future. If we were to make a significant acquisition in the future, we might find it advantageous
to utilize third-party financing sources based on factors such as our then available cash and its
source (i.e., cash held in the United States of America versus international locations), the cost
of financing and our internal cost of capital.

Investing Activities  

The table below aggregates certain line items from our condensed consolidated statements of
cash flows to present the key items affecting our cash flows from investing activities:

The primary use of cash from investing activities is the net purchases of
marketable securities of $90.0 million. 

Cash paid for technology acquisitions and other investments, net of cash acquired, for
the nine months ended December 31, 2004 includes $203.4 million for our purchase of
Marimba, including direct costs of the transaction. 

The main components of other cash used in investing activities are purchases of property
and equipment, primarily computer hardware and software, and software development costs
capitalized. 

Financing Activities  

The table below aggregates certain line items from our condensed consolidated statements of
cash flows to present the key items affecting our cash flows from financing activities:

There were no borrowings during the nine months ended December 31, 2004 and 2005,
and the main use of cash for financing activities was the acquisition of treasury stock.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2005, approximately 14.8 million shares of
treasury stock were purchased, representing a significant increase over previous quarters.
We plan to continue this increased pace of treasury stock purchases, subject to market
conditions, other possible uses of our cash and our domestic liquidity position. 

27

Table of Contents   

The exercise of stock options was the primary source of cash from financing activities. 

The Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended December 31,
2004 and 2005, are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities  

At December 31, 2005, our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $1,173.5
million, a decrease of approximately $109.6 million from March 31, 2005. This decrease is primarily
the result of treasury stock purchases, purchases of property and equipment and software
development costs, partially offset by cash flow generated from operating activities and proceeds
from the exercise of stock options for the nine months ended December 31, 2005. Approximately 50%
of the cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2005 are held in
international locations and was largely generated from our international operations. Our
international operations have generated approximately $90.5 million of earnings for which United
States income taxes have not been recorded. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we incurred
tax expense of approximately $36.5 million related to our adoption of a plan to repatriate
approximately $717.2 million of qualified international earnings under the applicable provisions of
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, of which $625.0 million has been repatriated to date. The
Act provides for a special one-time tax deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are
repatriated.

Our marketable securities are primarily investment grade and highly liquid. A significant
dollar portion of our marketable securities is invested in securities with maturities beyond one
year, and while typically yielding greater returns, investing in such securities reduces reported
working capital.

Treasury Stock Purchases  

As of December 31, 2005, our Board of Directors had authorized up to $2.0 billion in stock
repurchase programs ($500.0 million authorized in April 2000; subsequently increased by $500.0
million in July 2002; and an additional $1.0 billion in November 2005). During the quarter and nine
months ended December 31, 2005, we purchased approximately 4.9 million and 14.8 million shares for
$100.0 million and $286.0 million, respectively. From the inception of the repurchase program
through December 31, 2005, we have purchased 59.4 million shares for approximately $1.1 billion.
See  PART II. Item 2. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities  below for a monthly detail of treasury
stock purchases for the quarter ending December 31, 2005. The repurchase program is funded solely
with domestic cash and marketable securities and, therefore, affects the domestic versus
international liquidity balances.

Repurchases of our common stock will occur over time through open market purchases, through
unsolicited or solicited privately negotiated transactions, or in such other manner as will comply
with the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

Contractual Obligations  

Our contractual obligations are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
March 31, 2005. There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations since March 31,
2005.

Acquisitions  

On August 24, 2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of KMXperts
Inc., for an aggregate purchase price of $5.3 million in cash, including direct deal costs.
KMXperts  results have been included in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
since the acquisition date as part of the Service Management segment. This acquisition will
strengthen our BSM-related offerings through the addition of knowledge management solutions for IT
service and customer support centers.

ITEM 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

We are exposed to a variety of risks, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
and changes in the market value of our investments in marketable securities. In the normal course
of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage these risks including the use
of derivative instruments. There have been no material changes in our foreign exchange risk
management strategy or our portfolio management strategy subsequent to March 31, 2005, therefore
the risk profile of our market risk sensitive instruments remains substantially unchanged from the
description in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2005.

28

Table of Contents   

ITEM 4.    Controls and Procedures  

Material Weaknesses Previously Disclosed 

As discussed in Item 9A of our 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we did not maintain effective
internal control over financial reporting due to material weaknesses as of March 31, 2005 in the
following three areas: (1) the design and operation of our internal controls over monitoring and
analysis of vendor specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value of our maintenance and
professional services; (2) the design and operation of our internal controls over monitoring and
analysis of our deferred revenue account; and (3) the design and operation of our internal controls
over the accounting for sales commissions. As also disclosed in our 2005 Annual Report, we are
implementing actions to remediate these material weaknesses. While we have made progress in
remediating the material weaknesses, we are continuing to address the issues underlying each of the
material weaknesses, including both the process deficiencies and inadequate staffing of
experienced, specialized accounting personnel. Sufficient time has not passed to properly test the
effectiveness of the controls post-remediation.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of December 31, 2005, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of our principal
executive officer (CEO) and principal financial officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. In
light of the material weaknesses previously disclosed, which have not been completely remediated as
of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our CEO and CFO concluded, after the
evaluation described above, that our disclosure controls were not effective, as of the end of the
period covered by this Quarterly Report. Notwithstanding this conclusion, our preparation of the
financial statements for the period covered by this report, and our evaluation of disclosure
controls as of the end of such period, were conducted with particular attention to the material
weaknesses previously disclosed, and management continued to retain third party consultants and
hire additional accounting personnel during the period to provide certain compensating controls and
other assistance in areas where material weaknesses were identified. Accordingly, management
believes that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report
fairly present, in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows as of and for the periods presented.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Each of the identified material weaknesses was caused, in part, by inadequate staffing of
experienced, specialized accounting personnel. Therefore, our remediation activities for each
material weakness included hiring additional personnel trained and experienced in the complex
accounting areas of revenue recognition, revenue accounting and sales commissions accounting. The
hiring of additional accounting personnel during our second and third fiscal quarters represents a
change that is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial
reporting. We will continue to assess the adequacy of our accounting structure and organization,
both in terms of size and United States generally accepted accounting principles expertise.

The specific remediation actions taken to date for each material weakness are described below:

1. To provide reasonable assurance that we timely and properly monitor VSOE of fair value of our
maintenance and professional services, we took the following actions during the time periods
indicated below:

First Quarter Fiscal 2006 

We established a quarterly comprehensive analysis of independent sales of maintenance and professional services; and 

We added preventive controls, including policies requiring executive level oversight of contract pricing. 

These changes are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

Second Quarter Fiscal 2006 

We began conducting comprehensive analyses of independent sales of maintenance and
professional services on a monthly basis; 

We increased the frequency of the monitoring by our accounting department of the
independent sales and renewal rates of our maintenance and professional services from
quarterly to monthly; 

29

Table of Contents   

We increased our review of maintenance and professional services contracts at the time
of order entry; and 

We increased the communication between accounting and sales personnel and increased the
training of our sales force regarding our revenue recognition rules. 

These changes are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial
reporting. While we continued to implement and enforce these changes during our third fiscal
quarter, there were no additional changes in response to this material weakness made during the
third fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

2. To provide reasonable assurance that we properly monitor and analyze our deferred revenue and
accurately recognize such revenue, we took the following actions during the time periods indicated
below:

First Quarter Fiscal 2006 

We improved the monitoring of deferred contracts where recognition is dependent on the
occurrence of one or more events by developing direct lines of periodic communication
between departments responsible for the events which drive the specific transaction s
recognition. 

Second Quarter Fiscal 2006 

We began adding detailed transactional processes to analyze current deferred contracts
and properly recognize associated revenues; and 

We initiated a review of previously deferred revenue transactions to validate data for
each deferred transaction, including the basis for deferral, the basis of recognition and
the term length. 

These changes are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial
reporting.

Third Quarter Fiscal 2006 

We formalized our periodic analysis and documentation of amounts deferred and recognized
for the quarter. 

These changes are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial
reporting.

3. To provide reasonable assurance that we properly account for sales commissions, we have taken,
and plan to take, the following actions during the time periods indicated below:

First Quarter Fiscal 2006 

We instituted consistent sales commission accounting policies to account for sales
commissions on a detailed transactional basis in each region; and 

We began performing monthly reviews of commission expenses. 

These changes are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial
reporting.

Third Quarter Fiscal 2006 

We implemented detailed transactional processes to analyze sales commissions and
revenues recognized on associated transactions; 

We instituted automated deferred commissions reporting to track sales commissions by
each transaction; and 

We instituted a formalized periodic regional and worldwide analysis of sales
commissions, including amounts deferred and amounts expensed to identify trends and the
reasons thereof. 

These changes are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial
reporting.

Because the remedial actions we have undertaken are very recent and because they relate, in part,
to the hiring of additional personnel and many of the controls in our system of internal controls
rely extensively on manual review and approval, the successful operation of these controls for, at
least, several fiscal quarters may be required prior to management being able to conclude that the
material weaknesses have been eliminated.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.    Legal Proceedings  

In January 2003, we filed a complaint against NetIQ Corporation (NetIQ) in the United States
District Court of the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, alleging that one or more of
NetIQ s software products and their use infringe a valid United States patent held by us and one or
more of our trademarks. In August 2003, the Court ordered the case stayed pending arbitration. In
September 2003, we filed a Statement of Claim with the American Arbitration Association asserting
our claims of patent infringement, subject to our objections to the arbitration proceeding. We are
seeking to enjoin NetIQ s current and future infringement of our patent and to recover compensatory
damages and enhanced damages, interest, costs and fees. In November 2003, NetIQ filed a
counterclaim with the American Arbitration Association against us alleging patent infringement. We
have denied that we infringe any valid claim of the NetIQ patent, which forms the basis of NetIQ s
counterclaim. In November 2004, we were awarded an interim ruling from the arbitration panel that
eliminates several of NetIQ s asserted defenses in this case. In April 2005, we amended our
Statement of Claim to allege that one or more of NetIQ s software products infringe a second valid
United States patent held by us. Discovery is in the early stages, and a final hearing in the case
is not expected until late calendar year 2006.

We are subject to various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted,
which arise in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that the outcome of any of these
legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results
of operations.

ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors  

There have been no material changes to the risk factors as presented in our most recent public
filing on Report Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30, 2005, dated November 9, 2005.

ITEM 2.    Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities  

(1)  
       
      Includes repurchases made pursuant to the publicly announced plan in footnote
 (2)  below and repurchases in satisfaction of tax obligations upon the lapse of
restrictions on employee restricted stock grants and repurchases of shares from Directors. 

(2)  
       
      In April 2000, our Board of Directors authorized a $500.0 million stock repurchase
program. In July 2002, the Board of Directors increased the authorized stock repurchase
program by $500.0 million. In November 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the addition of
another $1 billion to the stock repurchase program. At December 31, 2005, there was
approximately $ 934.4 million remaining in the stock repurchase program. This program does not
have an expiration date. 

(3)   
       
     Includes additional $1 billion stock repurchase authorized by the Board of Directors
in November 2005.

ITEM
5.  Other Information  

As previously disclosed in our proxy statement and a Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 27,
2005, the short-term incentive compensation plan for our CEO and executive officers for fiscal 2006
has three components. The first component is a quarterly incentive based on achieving certain
earnings per share ( EPS ) targets. An aggregate of 25% of the annual target incentive, or 6.25%
per quarter, is based on the quarterly EPS targets. The second component is an annual incentive
based on achieving an annual EPS target, and 25% of the annual target incentive is based on the
annual EPS target. The third component, or 50% of the annual target incentive, is based on
achieving an annual corporate operating margin target. Our Compensation Committee and Board of
Directors have recently revised the EPS targets for our fourth quarter and full fiscal year and
have eliminated the previously established revenue threshold with respect to the annual EPS target
and corporate operating margin target. In addition, if we achieve our EPS target for our fourth
quarter, our executive officers will be paid an additional quarterly bonus equal to 6.25% of their
annual incentive as added incentive for achieving the fourth quarter target. The actual bonus
payments under the annual EPS and margin components may be less than or greater than the target
amounts depending on whether and the extent to which the targets for such components are achieved.

other circumstance which renders the Executive mentally or physically incapable of performing the

6.3 
       
     DEFINITION OF  FOR CAUSE  AND  GOOD REASON  

a. 
       
     For purposes of Section 6.1, the phrase  for cause  means: (i)
the Executive s continued and material failure to perform her obligations under
this Agreement; (ii) the Executive s material failure to adhere to any Employer
policy or code of conduct; (iii) the appropriation (or attempted appropriation)
of a material business opportunity of the Employer, including attempting to
secure or securing any personal profit in connection with any transaction
entered into on behalf of the Employer; (iv) the Executive s engaging in
conduct that is materially injurious to the Employer, (v) the misappropriation
(or attempted misappropriation) of any of the Employer s funds or property;
(vi) the conviction of or the entering of a guilty plea or plea of no contest
with respect to, a felony, the equivalent thereof, or any other crime with
respect to which imprisonment is a punishment; or (vii) the conviction of the
Executive by a court of competent jurisdiction of a crime involving moral
turpitude. The determination of whether the Executive s employment is
terminated for cause shall be made solely by the Employer, which shall act in
good faith in making such determination. 

b. 
       
      Good Reason  means: 

i. 
       
     The occurrence, prior to a Change of Control or
on or after the date which is 12 months after a Change of Control
occurs, of any one or more of the following events without the
Executive s express written consent: (i) Executive no longer being, at
a minimum, 

6

Senior Vice President   General Counsel and Secretary with
substantially similar responsibilities (included an alteration in
Executive s reporting responsibilities); (ii) a reduction in the
Executive s Salary or target bonus amount from that provided to her
immediately on the Effective Date of this Agreement (or the effective
date of any extension of this Agreement pursuant to Paragraph 7(a))
or as the same may be increased from time to time; (iii) a
diminution in employee benefits (including but not limited to
medical, dental, life insurance and long-term disability plans) and
perquisites applicable to the Executive from those substantially
similar to the employee benefits and perquisites provided by the
Employer (including subsidiaries) to executives with comparable
duties, as such benefits may be modified from time to time; or (iv)
the Employer or a subsidiary thereof requiring Executive to be
permanently based anywhere other than within 50 miles of Houston,
Texas; or 

ii. 
       
     The occurrence, within 12 months after the date
upon which a Change of Control occurs, of any one or more of the
following events without Executive s express written consent: (i) a
change in Executive s reporting responsibilities, titles or offices as
in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control or any removal of
Executive from, or any failure to re-elect Executive to, any of such
positions which has the effect of diminishing Executive s
responsibility or authority; (ii) a reduction by the Employer or a
subsidiary thereof in Executive s Salary or bonus target amount as in
effect immediately prior to the Change of Control or as the same may be
increased from time to time or a change in the eligibility requirements
or performance criteria under any bonus, incentive or compensation
plan, program or arrangement under which Executive is covered
immediately prior to the Change of Control which adversely affects
Executive; (iii) the Employer or a subsidiary thereof requiring
Executive to be permanently based anywhere other than within 50 miles
of Executive s job location at the time of the Change of Control; (iv)
without replacement by a plan providing benefits to Executive equal to
or greater than those discontinued, the failure by the Employer or a
subsidiary thereof to continue in effect, within its maximum stated
term, any pension, bonus, incentive, stock ownership, purchase, option,
life insurance, health, accident, disability, or any other employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement in which Executive is
participating at the time of the Change of Control, or the taking of
any action by the Employer or a subsidiary thereof that would adversely
affect Executive s participation or materially reduce Executive s
benefits under any of such plans; (v) the taking of any action by the 

7

Employer or a subsidiary thereof that would materially adversely
affect the physical conditions existing at the time of the Change of
Control in or under which Executive performs her employment duties;
(vi) if Executive s primary employment duties are with a subsidiary
of the Employer, the sale, merger, contribution, transfer or any
other transaction in conjunction with which the Employer s ownership
interest in the subsidiary decreases below a majority interest;
or (vii) any material variance from the terms of this Agreement
by the Employer or a subsidiary thereof. 

Should the Executive s employment with the Employer be terminated during the Employment Period
pursuant to Section 6.1(e) or Section 6.1(f) above, the Executive shall be entitled to:

a. 
       
     a payment equal to two (2) years of her then current Salary;
and 

b. 
       
     a payment equal to two (2) times her then current cash bonus
target amount. 

Such payments under this section will be made no later than 30 days following the termination
from employment. Severance payments do not constitute continued employment beyond the termination
date.

If, within 12 months of a Change of Control, the Executive s position is eliminated or the
Executive is terminated pursuant to Section 6.1(e) or 6.1(f) above, regardless of whether such
termination event occurs during or after the Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled to
the following in lieu of the amounts set forth in Section 6.4:

a. 
       
     a payment equal to two (2) years of her then current Salary; 

b. 
       
     a payment equal to two (2) times her then current cash bonus
target amount; 

c. 
       
     vesting of Executive s stock option awards, subject to the
terms and conditions of the respective stock option agreements; and 

d. 
       
     continued medical and life insurance benefits at no cost to the
Executive, for the Executive and her dependents (including her spouse) who were
covered as of such termination event under the medical and life insurance
benefit plan as in effect for employees of the Employer during the coverage
period, or the substantial equivalence, for 18 months or until 

8

such time that she is re-employed and is provided medical and life insurance
benefits (which coverage shall be promptly reported to the Employer by the
Executive) whichever is sooner. 

Severance payments do not constitute continued employment beyond the termination date.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Executive is a
 disqualified individual  (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the  Code )), and the severance benefits provided for in this Section
6.5, together with any other payments and benefits which the Executive has the right to
receive from the Employer and its affiliates, would constitute a  parachute payment  (as
defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code), then the severance benefits provided hereunder
(beginning with any benefit to be paid in cash hereunder) shall be either (1) reduced (but
not below zero) so that the present value of such total amounts and benefits received by
the Executive will be one dollar ($1.00) less than three times the Executive s  base
amount  (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) and so that no portion of such amounts and
benefits received by the Executive shall be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section
4999 of the Code or (2) paid in full, whichever produces the better net after-tax position
to the Executive (taking into account any applicable excise tax under Section 4999 of the
Code and any other applicable taxes). The determination as to whether any such reduction
in the amount of the severance benefit is necessary shall be made initially by the Employer
in good faith. If a reduced severance benefit is paid hereunder in accordance with clause
(1) of the first sentence of this paragraph and through error or otherwise that payment,
when aggregated with other payments and benefits from the Employer (or its affiliates) used
in determining if a  parachute payment  exists, exceeds one dollar ($1.00) less than three
times the Executive s base amount, then the Executive shall immediately repay such excess
to the Employer upon notification that an overpayment has been made.

6.6 NO MITIGATION

Any remuneration received by the Executive from a third party following the Employment Period shall
not apply to reduce the Employer s obligations to make payments hereunder.

6.7 LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

Due to the difficulties in estimating damages for an early termination of the Employment Period,
the Employer and the Executive agree that the payments, if any, to be received by the Executive
hereunder shall be received as liquidated damages.

9

7.  
       
      NON-DISCLOSURE COVENANT; EMPLOYEE INVENTIONS  

7.1 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS BY THE EXECUTIVE

The Executive acknowledges that (a) prior to and during the Employment Period and as a part of
her employment, the Executive has been and will be afforded access to Confidential Information; (b)
public disclosure of such Confidential Information could have an adverse effect on the Employer and
its business; (c) because the Executive possesses substantial technical expertise and skill with
respect to the Employer s business, the Employer desires to obtain exclusive ownership of each
Employee Invention, and the Employer will be at a substantial competitive disadvantage if it fails
to acquire exclusive ownership of each Employee Invention; and (d) the provisions of this Section 7
are reasonable and necessary to prevent the improper use or disclosure of Confidential Information
and to provide the Employer with exclusive ownership of all Employee Inventions.

7.2 AGREEMENTS OF THE EXECUTIVE

In consideration of the compensation and benefits to be paid or provided to the Executive by
the Employer under this Agreement, the Executive covenants the following:

a. 
       
      Confidentiality . 

i. 
       
     The Executive will hold in confidence the
Confidential Information and will not disclose it to any person except
with the specific prior written consent of the Employer or except as
otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement. 

ii. 
       
     Any trade secrets of the Employer will be
entitled to all of the protections and benefits under any applicable
law. If any information that the Employer deems to be a trade secret
is found by a court of competent jurisdiction not to be a trade secret
for purposes of this Agreement, such information will, nevertheless, be
considered Confidential Information for purposes of this Agreement.
The Executive hereby waives any requirement that the Employer submit
proof of the economic value of any trade secret or post a bond or other
security. 

iii. 
       
     None of the foregoing obligations and
restrictions applies to any part of the Confidential Information that
the Executive demonstrates was or became generally available to the
public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Executive. 

iv. 
       
     The Executive will not remove from the
Employer s premises (except to the extent such removal is for purposes
of the performance of the Executive s duties at home or while
traveling, 

10

or except as otherwise specifically authorized by the Employer) any
document, record, notebook, plan, model, component, device, or
computer software or code, whether embodied in a disk or in any other
form (collectively, the  Proprietary Items ). The Executive
recognizes that, as between the Employer and the Executive, all of
the Proprietary Items, whether or not developed by the Executive, are
the exclusive property of the Employer. Upon termination of this
Agreement by either party, or upon the request of the Employer during
the Employment Period, the Executive will return to the Employer all
of the Proprietary Items in the Executive s possession or subject to
the Executive s control, and the Executive shall not retain any
copies, abstracts, sketches, or other physical embodiment of any of
the Proprietary Items. 

b. 
       
      Employee Inventions . Each Employee Invention will
belong exclusively to the Employer. The Executive acknowledges that all of the
Executive s writing, works of authorship, and other Employee Inventions are
works made for hire and the property of the Employer, including any copyrights,
patents, or other intellectual property rights pertaining thereto. If it is
determined that any such works are not works made for hire, the Executive
hereby assigns to the Employer all of the Executive s right, title, and
interest, including all rights of copyright, patent, and other intellectual
property rights, to or in such Employee Inventions. The Executive covenants
that she will promptly: 

i. 
       
     disclose to the Employer in writing any
Employee Invention; 

ii.

8.2 
       
     COVENANTS OF THE EXECUTIVE 

In consideration of the acknowledgments by the Executive, and in consideration of the
compensation and benefits to be paid or provided to the Executive by the Employer, the Executive
covenants that during and for eighteen months following the Employment Period she will not,
directly or indirectly:

a. 
       
     except in the course of her employment hereunder, engage or

the products or activities of the Employer anywhere in the world, provided,
however, that (i) if Executive is terminated by Employer without cause or if
Executive terminates her employment pursuant to Section 6.1(f) hereof, then
Executive s non-compete obligation set forth in this Section 8.2(a) shall only
apply to the companies listed in Attachment B hereto and (ii) further provided
that the Executive may purchase or otherwise acquire up to (but not more than)
five percent (5%) of any class of securities of any enterprise (but without

If any covenant in this Section 8.2 is held to be unreasonable, arbitrary, or against public
policy, such covenant will be considered to be divisible with respect to scope, time, and
geographic area, and such lesser scope, time, or geographic area, or all of them, as a court of
competent jurisdiction may determine to be reasonable, not arbitrary, and not against public
policy, will be effective, binding, and enforceable against the Executive.

The period of time applicable to any covenant in this Section 8.2 will be extended by the
duration of any violation by the Executive of such covenant.

9.  
       
      GENERAL PROVISIONS  

9.1 
       
     INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ADDITIONAL REMEDY 

The Executive acknowledges that the injury that would be suffered by the Employer as a result
of a breach of the provisions of this Agreement (including any provision of Sections 7 and 8) would
be irreparable and that an award of monetary damages to the Employer for such a breach would be an
inadequate remedy. Consequently, the Employer will have the right, in addition to any other rights
it may have, to obtain injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach or otherwise
to specifically enforce any provision of this Agreement, and the Employer will not be obligated to
post bond or other security in seeking such relief.

9.2 
       
     COVENANTS OF SECTIONS 7 AND 8 ARE ESSENTIAL AND INDEPENDENT COVENANTS 

The covenants by the Executive in Sections 7 and 8 are essential elements of this Agreement,
and without the Executive s agreement to comply with such covenants, the Employer would not have
entered into this Agreement or employed the Executive. The Employer and the Executive have
independently consulted with their respective counsel and have been advised in all respects
concerning the reasonableness and propriety of such covenants, with specific regard to the nature
of the business conducted by the Employer.

14

If the Executive s employment hereunder expires or is terminated, this Agreement will continue
in full force and effect as is necessary or appropriate to enforce the covenants and agreements of
the Executive in Sections 7 and 8.

9.3 
       
     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY THE EXECUTIVE 

The Executive represents and warrants to the Employer that the execution and delivery by the
Executive of this Agreement do not, and the performance by the Executive of the Executive s
obligations hereunder will not, with or without the giving of notice or the passage of time, or
both: (a) violate any judgment, writ, injunction, or order of any court, arbitrator, or
governmental agency applicable to the Executive; or (b) conflict with, result in the breach of any
provisions of or the termination of, or constitute a default under, any agreement to which the
Executive is a party or by which the Executive is or may be bound. The Executive further
specifically represents and warrants that she is not subject to, nor will she violate, any
agreement not to compete upon the execution and delivery by her of this Agreement.

The Executive represents and warrants that she will not utilize or divulge any proprietary
materials or information from her previous employers and acknowledges that Employer has prohibited
Executive from bringing any such materials on to Employer s premises and has advised Executive that
Executive s failure to adhere to these prohibitions will subject Executive to immediate
termination.

9.4 
       
     OBLIGATIONS CONTINGENT ON PERFORMANCE 

The obligations of the Employer hereunder, including its obligation to pay the compensation
provided for herein, are contingent upon the Executive s performance of the Executive s obligations
hereunder.

The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative.
Neither the failure nor any delay by either party in exercising any right, power, or privilege
under this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power, or privilege, and no single or
partial exercise of any such right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise
of such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. To the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement can
be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right
unless in writing signed by the other party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be
applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on
one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such party or of the right of the
party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in
this Agreement.

9.9 GOVERNING LAW 

This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Texas without regard to conflicts

9.10 ARBITRATION

In the event that there shall be any dispute arising out of or in any way relating to this
Agreement, the contemplated transactions, any document referred to or incorporated herein by
reference or centrally related to the subject matter hereof, or the subject matter of any of the
same, the parties covenant and agree as follows:

a. 
       
     The parties shall first use their reasonable best efforts to
resolve such dispute among themselves, with or without mediation. 

b. 
       
     If the parties are unable to resolve such dispute among
themselves, such dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration in Houston,
Texas, under the auspices of, and pursuant to the rules of, the American
Arbitration Association s Commercial Arbitration Rules as then in effect, or
such other procedures as the parties may agree to at the time, before a
tribunal of three (3) arbitrators, one of which shall be selected by the
Executive, one of which shall be selected by the Employer, and the third of
which shall be selected by the two (2) arbitrators so selected. Any award
issued as a result of such arbitration shall be final and binding between the
parties, and shall be enforceable by any court having jurisdiction over the
party against whom enforcement is sought. A ruling by the arbitrators shall be
non-appealable. The parties agree to abide by and perform any award rendered
by the arbitrators. If either the Executive or Employer seeks enforcement of
the terms of this Agreement or seeks enforcement of any award rendered by the
arbitrators, then the prevailing party (designated by the arbitrators) to such
proceeding(s) shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses (including
applicable travel expenses) from 

17

the non-prevailing party, in addition to any other relief to which it may be
entitled. If a dispute arises and one party fails or refuses to designate
an arbitrator within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written notice that
an arbitration proceeding is to be held, then the dispute shall be resolved
solely by the arbitrator designated by the other party and such arbitration
award shall be as binding as if three (3) arbitrators had participated in
the arbitration proceeding. Either the Executive or the Employer may cause
an arbitration proceeding to commence by giving the other party notice in
writing of such arbitration. Executive and the Employer covenant and agree
to act as expeditiously as practicable in order to resolve all disputes by
arbitration. Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary,
neither Executive nor the Employer shall be precluded from seeking court
action in the event the action sought is either injunctive action, a
restraining order or other equitable relief. The arbitration proceeding
shall be held in English. 

c. 
       
     Legal process in any action or proceeding referred to in the
preceding section may be served on any party anywhere in the world. 

d. 
       
     Except as expressly provided herein and except for injunctions
and other equitable remedies that are required in order to enforce this
Agreement, no action may be brought in any court of law and  EACH OF THE PARTIES
WAIVES ANY RIGHTS THAT IT MAY HAVE TO BRING A CAUSE OF ACTION IN ANY COURT OR
IN ANY PROCEEDING INVOLVING A JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW .
Each party acknowledges that it has been represented by legal counsel of its
own choosing and has been advised of the intent, scope and effect of this
Section 9.10 and has voluntarily entered into this Agreement and this Section
9.10. 

e. 
       
     Excluded from this Section 9.10 are any claims for temporary
injunctive relief to enforce Sections 7 and 8 of this Agreement.

The headings of Sections in this Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not
affect its construction or interpretation. All references to  Section  or  Sections  refer to the

jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any

respecting Benefits, Stock Options, and Cash Bonus will be determined under the applicable plan or
program providing the same.

6.2 
       
     DEFINITION OF DISABILITY 

For purposes hereof, the term  Disability  shall mean an incapacity by accident, illness or
other circumstance which renders the Executive mentally or physically incapable of performing the
duties and services required of the Executive hereunder on a full-time basis for a period of at
least 180 consecutive days.

6.3 
       
     DEFINITION OF  FOR CAUSE  AND  GOOD REASON  

a. 
       
     For purposes of Section 6.1, the phrase  for cause  means: (i)
the Executive s continued and material failure to perform his obligations under
this Agreement; (ii) the Executive s material failure to adhere to any Employer
policy or code of conduct; (iii) the appropriation (or attempted appropriation)
of a material business opportunity of the Employer, including attempting to
secure or securing any personal profit in 

6

connection with any transaction entered into on behalf of the Employer; (iv)
the Executive s engaging in conduct that is materially injurious to the
Employer, (v) the misappropriation (or attempted misappropriation) of any of
the Employer s funds or property; (vi) the conviction of or the entering of
a guilty plea or plea of no contest with respect to, a felony, the
equivalent thereof, or any other crime with respect to which imprisonment is
a punishment; or (vii) the conviction of the Executive by a court of
competent jurisdiction of a crime involving moral turpitude. The
determination of whether the Executive s employment is terminated for cause
shall be made solely by the Employer, which shall act in good faith in
making such determination. 

b. 
       
      Good Reason  means: 

i. 
       
     The occurrence, prior to a Change of Control or
after the date which is 12 months after a Change of Control occurs, of
any one or more of the following events without the Executive s express
written consent: (i) a significant change in the Executive s titles or
offices from those previously applicable to the Executive (but  not  an
alteration in Executive s reporting responsibilities); (ii) a reduction
in the Executive s Salary or target bonus amount from that provided to
him immediately on the Effective Date of this Agreement (or the
effective date of any extension of this Agreement pursuant to Paragraph
7(a)) or as the same may be increased from time to time; or (iii) a
diminution in employee benefits (including but not limited to medical,
dental, life insurance and long-term disability plans) and perquisites
applicable to the Executive from those substantially similar to the
employee benefits and perquisites provided by the Employer (including
subsidiaries) to executives with comparable duties; or 

ii. 
       
     The occurrence, within 12 months after the date
upon which a Change of Control occurs, of any one or more of the
following events without Executive s express written consent: (i) a
change in Executive s reporting responsibilities, titles or offices as
in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control or any removal of
Executive from, or any failure to re-elect Executive to, any of such
positions which has the effect of diminishing Executive s
responsibility or authority; (ii) a reduction by the Employer or a
subsidiary thereof in Executive s Salary or target bonus amount as in
effect immediately prior to the Change of Control or as the same may be
increased from time to time or a change in the eligibility requirements
or performance criteria under any bonus, incentive or compensation
plan, program or arrangement under which Executive is covered
immediately prior to the Change of Control which adversely affects
Executive; (iii) 

7

the Employer or a subsidiary thereof requiring Executive to be
permanently based anywhere other than within 50 miles of Executive s
job location at the time of the Change of Control; (iv) without
replacement by a plan providing benefits to Executive equal to or
greater than those discontinued, the failure by the Employer or a
subsidiary thereof to continue in effect, within its maximum stated
term, any pension, bonus, incentive, stock ownership, purchase,
option, life insurance, health, accident, disability, or any other
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement in which Executive is
participating at the time of the Change of Control, or the taking of
any action by the Employer or a subsidiary thereof that would
adversely affect Executive s participation or materially reduce
Executive s benefits under any of such plans; (v) the taking of any
action by the Employer or a subsidiary thereof that would materially
adversely affect the physical conditions existing at the time of the
Change of Control in or under which Executive performs his employment
duties; (vi) if Executive s primary employment duties are with a
subsidiary of the Employer, the sale, merger, contribution, transfer
or any other transaction in conjunction with which the Employer s
ownership interest in the subsidiary decreases below a majority
interest; or (vii) any material variance from the terms of
this Agreement by the Employer or a subsidiary thereof. 

Should the Executive s employment with the Employer be terminated during the Employment Period
pursuant to Section 6.1(e) or Section 6.1(f) above, the Executive shall be entitled to:

a. 
       
     a payment equal to two years of his then current Salary; and 

b. 
       
     a payment equal to two times his then current cash bonus target
amount. 

Such payments under this section will be made no later than 30 days following the termination
from employment. Severance payments do not constitute continued employment beyond the termination
date.

If, within 12 months of a Change of Control, the Executive s position is eliminated or the
Executive is terminated pursuant to Section 6.1(e) or 6.1(f) above, regardless of whether such
termination event occurs during or after the Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled to
the following in lieu of the amounts set forth in Section 6.4:

a. 
       
     a payment equal to two years of his then current Salary; 

8

b. 
       
     a payment equal to two times his then current cash bonus target
amount; 

c. 
       
     vesting of Executive s stock option awards, subject to the
terms and conditions of the respective stock option agreements; and 

d. 
       
     continued medical and life insurance benefits at no cost to the
Executive, for the Executive and his dependents (including his spouse) who were
covered as of such termination event under the medical and life insurance
benefit plan as in effect for employees of the Employer during the coverage
period, or the substantial equivalence, for 18 months or until such time that
he is re-employed and is provided medical and life insurance benefits (which
coverage shall be promptly reported to the Employer by the Executive) whichever
is sooner. 

Severance payments do not constitute continued employment beyond the termination date.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Executive is a
 disqualified individual  (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the  Code )), and the severance benefits provided for in this Section 6.5, together with
any other payments and benefits which the Executive has the right to receive from the Employer and
its affiliates, would constitute a  parachute payment  (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the
Code), then the severance benefits provided hereunder (beginning with any benefit to be paid in
cash hereunder) shall be either (1) reduced (but not below zero) so that the present value of such
total amounts and benefits received by the Executive will be one dollar ($1.00) less than three
times the Executive s  base amount  (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) and so that no portion
of such amounts and benefits received by the Executive shall be subject to the excise tax imposed
by Section 4999 of the Code or (2) paid in full, whichever produces the better net after-tax
position to the Executive (taking into account any applicable excise tax under Section 4999 of the
Code and any other applicable taxes). The determination as to whether any such reduction in the
amount of the severance benefit is necessary shall be made initially by the Employer in good faith.
If a reduced severance benefit is paid hereunder in accordance with clause (1) of the first
sentence of this paragraph and through error or otherwise that payment, when aggregated with other
payments and benefits from the Employer (or its affiliates) used in determining if a  parachute
payment  exists, exceeds one dollar ($1.00) less than three times the Executive s base amount, then
the Executive shall immediately repay such excess to the Employer upon notification that an
overpayment has been made.

Any remuneration received by the Executive from a third party following the Employment Period shall
not apply to reduce the Employer s obligations to make payments hereunder.

9

Due to the difficulties in estimating damages for an early termination of the Employment Period,
the Employer and the Executive agree that the payments, if any, to be received by the Executive
hereunder shall be received as liquidated damages.

7.  
       
      NON-DISCLOSURE COVENANT; EMPLOYEE INVENTIONS  

7.1 
       
     ACKNOWLEDGMENTS BY THE EXECUTIVE 

The Executive acknowledges that (a) prior to and during the Employment Period and as a part of
his employment, the Executive has been and will be afforded access to Confidential Information; (b)
public disclosure of such Confidential Information could have an adverse effect on the Employer and
its business; (c) because the Executive possesses substantial technical expertise and skill with
respect to the Employer s business, the Employer desires to obtain exclusive ownership of each
Employee Invention, and the Employer will be at a substantial competitive disadvantage if it fails
to acquire exclusive ownership of each Employee Invention; and (d) the provisions of this Section 7
are reasonable and necessary to prevent the improper use or disclosure of Confidential Information
and to provide the Employer with exclusive ownership of all Employee Inventions.

7.2 
       
     AGREEMENTS OF THE EXECUTIVE 

In consideration of the compensation and benefits to be paid or provided to the Executive by
the Employer under this Agreement, the Executive covenants the following:

a. 
       
      Confidentiality . 

i. 
       
     The Executive will hold in confidence the
Confidential Information and will not disclose it to any person except
with the specific prior written consent of the Employer or except as
otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement. 

ii. 
       
     Any trade secrets of the Employer will be
entitled to all of the protections and benefits under any applicable
law. If any information that the Employer deems to be a trade secret
is found by a court of competent jurisdiction not to be a trade secret
for purposes of this Agreement, such information will, nevertheless, be
considered Confidential Information for purposes of this Agreement.
The Executive hereby waives any requirement that the Employer submit
proof of the economic value of any trade secret or post a bond or other
security. 

iii. 
       
     None of the foregoing obligations and
restrictions applies to any part of the Confidential Information that
the Executive 

10

demonstrates was or became generally available to the public other
than as a result of a disclosure by the Executive. 

iv. 
       
     The Executive will not remove from the
Employer s premises (except to the extent such removal is for purposes
of the performance of the Executive s duties at home or while
traveling, or except as otherwise specifically authorized by the
Employer) any document, record, notebook, plan, model, component,
device, or computer software or code, whether embodied in a disk or in
any other form (collectively, the  Proprietary Items ). The Executive
recognizes that, as between the Employer and the Executive, all of the
Proprietary Items, whether or not developed by the Executive, are the
exclusive property of the Employer. Upon termination of this Agreement
by either party, or upon the request of the Employer during the
Employment Period, the Executive will return to the Employer all of the
Proprietary Items in the Executive s possession or subject to the
Executive s control, and the Executive shall not retain any copies,
abstracts, sketches, or other physical embodiment of any of the
Proprietary Items. 

b. 
       
      Employee Inventions . Each Employee Invention will
belong exclusively to the Employer. The Executive acknowledges that all of the
Executive s writing, works of authorship, and other Employee Inventions are
works made for hire and the property of the Employer, including any copyrights,
patents, or other intellectual property rights pertaining thereto. If it is
determined that any such works are not works made for hire, the Executive
hereby assigns to the Employer all of the Executive s right, title, and
interest, including all rights of copyright, patent, and other intellectual
property rights, to or in such Employee Inventions. The Executive covenants
that he will promptly: 

i. 
       
     disclose to the Employer in writing any
Employee Invention; 

ii. 
       
     assign to the Employer or to a party designated
by the Employer, at the Employer s request and without additional
compensation, all of the Executive s right to the Employee Invention
for the United States and all foreign jurisdictions; 

iii. 
       
     execute and deliver to the Employer such
applications, assignments, and other documents as the Employer may
request in order to apply for and obtain patents or other registrations
with respect to any Employee Invention in the United States and any
foreign jurisdictions; 

iv. 
       
     sign all other papers necessary to carry out
the above obligations; and 

11

v. 
       
     give testimony and render any other assistance
in support of the Employer s rights to any Employee Invention. 

c. 
       
      Notice of Intent to Resign . Except in the event of a
resignation for Good Reason, Executive agrees to provide Employer with 90 days
advance notice of his intention to resign ( Notice Period ). During the Notice
Period, Executive shall continue in the diligent fulfillment of all duties of
his position and this Agreement. Should Executive fail to provide Employer
with the full Notice Period, Executive shall forfeit that portion of his earned
pro-rata yearly cash bonus as follows: 

(90   (number of full days of advance notice) / 90) X(times) pro-rata
earned yearly cash bonus = amount forfeited by Executive. 

Pro-rata earned yearly cash bonus is: (unconditional portion of yearly cash
bonus, if any, targeted for Executive in the current Fiscal Year) / (number
of full months worked in the current Fiscal Year / 12). 

d. 
       
      NonDisparagement . Executive shall not disparage the
Employer or any of its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, or agents. 

e. 
       
      Creative Works . Executive shall not create, assist
with or consult on any creative works which discuss, describe or reference
Employer or any executive of Employer. Creative works includes but is not
limited to novels, nonfiction writings, any authored work, plays, screenplays,
musicals or the like. 

7.3 
       
     DISPUTES OR CONTROVERSIES 

The Executive recognizes that should a dispute or controversy arising from or relating to this
Agreement be submitted for adjudication to any court, arbitration panel, or other third party, the
preservation of the secrecy of Confidential Information may be jeopardized. All pleadings,
documents, testimony, and records relating to any such adjudication will be maintained in secrecy
and will be available for inspection by the Employer, the Executive, and their respective attorneys
and experts, who will agree, in advance and in writing, to receive and maintain all such
information in secrecy, except as may be limited by them in writing.

12

8.  
       
      NON-COMPETITION AND NON-INTERFERENCE  

8.1 
       
     ACKNOWLEDGMENTS BY THE EXECUTIVE 

The Executive acknowledges that: (a) the services to be performed by him under this Agreement
are of a special, unique, unusual, extraordinary, and intellectual character; (b) the Employer s
business is international in scope and its products are marketed throughout the United States and
the world; (c) the Employer competes with other businesses that are or could be located in any part
of the United States or the world; (d) the provisions of this Section 8 are reasonable and
necessary to protect the Employer s business; and (e) in connection with the fulfillment of his
duties hereunder and as an employee of the Employer, the Employer will provide Executive with
Confidential Information necessitating the execution of the covenants contained in this Section 8.

8.2 
       
     COVENANTS OF THE EXECUTIVE 

In consideration of the acknowledgments by the Executive, and in consideration of the
compensation and benefits to be paid or provided to the Executive by the Employer, the Executive
covenants that during and for two (2) years following the Employment Period he will not, directly
or indirectly:

a. 
       
     except in the course of his employment hereunder, engage or
invest in, own, manage, operate, finance, control, or participate in the
ownership, management, operation, financing, or control of, be employed by,
associated with, or in any manner connected with, lend the Executive s name or
any similar name to, lend Executive s credit to or render services or advice
to, any business whose products or activities compete in whole or in part with
the products or activities of the Employer anywhere in the world, provided,
however, that the Executive may purchase or otherwise acquire up to (but not
more than) five percent (5%) of any class of securities of any enterprise (but
without otherwise participating in the activities of such enterprise) if such
securities are listed on any national or regional securities exchange or have
been registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended; 

b. 
       
     whether for the Executive s own account or for the account of
any other person, solicit business of the same or similar type being carried on
by the Employer, from any person known by the Executive to be a customer or a
potential customer of the Employer, whether or not the Executive had personal
contact with such person during and by reason of the Executive s employment
with the Employer; 

c. 
       
     whether for the Executive s own account or the account of any
other person, (i) solicit, employ, or otherwise engage as an employee,
independent contractor, or otherwise, any person who is an employee (or 

13

was an employee within two (2) years of the date in question) of the
Employer at any time during the Employment Period or in any manner induce or
attempt to induce any employee of the Employer to terminate his employment
with the Employer; or (ii) interfere with the Employer s relationship with
any person, including any person who at any time during the Employment
Period was an employee, contractor, supplier, or customer of the Employer;
or 

If any covenant in this Section 8.2 is held to be unreasonable, arbitrary, or against public
policy, such covenant will be considered to be divisible with respect to scope, time, and
geographic area, and such lesser scope, time, or geographic area, or all of them, as a court of
competent jurisdiction may determine to be reasonable, not arbitrary, and not against public
policy, will be effective, binding, and enforceable against the Executive.

The period of time applicable to any covenant in this Section 8.2 will be extended by the
duration of any violation by the Executive of such covenant.

9.  
       
      GENERAL PROVISIONS  

9.1 
       
     INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ADDITIONAL REMEDY 

The Executive acknowledges that the injury that would be suffered by the Employer as a result
of a breach of the provisions of this Agreement (including any provision of Sections 7 and 8) would
be irreparable and that an award of monetary damages to the Employer for such a breach would be an
inadequate remedy. Consequently, the Employer will have the right, in addition to any other rights
it may have, to obtain injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach or otherwise
to specifically enforce any provision of this Agreement, and the Employer will not be obligated to
post bond or other security in seeking such relief.

9.2 
       
     COVENANTS OF SECTIONS 7 AND 8 ARE ESSENTIAL AND INDEPENDENT COVENANTS 

The covenants by the Executive in Sections 7 and 8 are essential elements of this Agreement,
and without the Executive s agreement to comply with such covenants, the Employer would not have
entered into this Agreement or employed the Executive. The Employer and the Executive have
independently consulted with their respective counsel and have been advised in all respects
concerning the reasonableness and propriety of such covenants, with specific regard to the nature
of the business conducted by the Employer.

If the Executive s employment hereunder expires or is terminated, this Agreement will continue
in full force and effect as is necessary or appropriate to enforce the covenants and agreements of
the Executive in Sections 7 and 8.

14

9.3 
       
     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY THE EXECUTIVE 

The Executive represents and warrants to the Employer that the execution and delivery by the
Executive of this Agreement do not, and the performance by the Executive of the Executive s
obligations hereunder will not, with or without the giving of notice or the passage of time, or
both: (a) violate any judgment, writ, injunction, or order of any court, arbitrator, or
governmental agency applicable to the Executive; or (b) conflict with, result in the breach of any
provisions of or the termination of, or constitute a default under, any agreement to which the
Executive is a party or by which the Executive is or may be bound. The Executive further
specifically represents and warrants that he is not subject to, nor will he violate, any agreement
not to compete upon the execution and delivery by him of this Agreement.

The Executive represents and warrants that he will not utilize or divulge any proprietary
materials or information from his previous employers and acknowledges that Employer has prohibited
Executive from bringing any such materials on to Employer s premises and has advised Executive that
Executive s failure to adhere to these prohibitions will subject Executive to immediate
termination.

9.4 
       
     OBLIGATIONS CONTINGENT ON PERFORMANCE 

The obligations of the Employer hereunder, including its obligation to pay the compensation
provided for herein, are contingent upon the Executive s performance of the Executive s obligations
hereunder.

The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative.
Neither the failure nor any delay by either party in exercising any right, power, or privilege
under this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power, or privilege, and no single or
partial exercise of any such right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise
of such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. To the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement can
be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right
unless in writing signed by the other party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be
applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on
one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such party or of the right of the
party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in
this Agreement.

15

9.6 
       
     BINDING EFFECT; DELEGATION OF DUTIES PROHIBITED 

This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be binding upon, the parties hereto
and their respective successors, assigns, heirs, and legal representatives, including any entity
with which the Employer may merge or consolidate or to which all or substantially all of its assets
may be transferred. The duties and covenants of the Executive under this Agreement, being
personal, may not be delegated or assigned.

All notices, consents, waivers, and other communications under this Agreement must be in
writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when (a) delivered by hand (with written
confirmation of receipt), (b) sent by facsimile (with written confirmation of receipt), provided
that a copy is mailed by registered mail, return receipt requested and signed for by the party
required to receive notice, or (c) when received by the addressee, if sent by a nationally
recognized overnight delivery service (receipt requested), in each case to the appropriate

     ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENTS 

Except as provided in (a) plans and programs of the Employer referred to in Sections 3.1(b)
through (d), and (b) any signed written agreement contemporaneously or hereafter executed by the
Employer and the Executive, this Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral
or written, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this Agreement shall not be construed to supersede any stock option agreements or
restricted stock agreements entered into between Executive and Employer at any time prior to the
execution of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended orally, but only by an agreement in
writing signed by the parties hereto.

16

This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Texas without regard to conflicts
of laws principles. 

In the event that there shall be any dispute arising out of or in any way relating to this
Agreement, the contemplated transactions, any document referred to or incorporated herein by
reference or centrally related to the subject matter hereof, or the subject matter of any of the
same, the parties covenant and agree as follows:

a. 
       
     The parties shall first use their reasonable best efforts to
resolve such dispute among themselves, with or without mediation. 

b. 
       
     If the parties are unable to resolve such dispute among
themselves, such dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration in Houston,
Texas, under the auspices of, and pursuant to the rules of, the American
Arbitration Association s Commercial Arbitration Rules as then in effect, or
such other procedures as the parties may agree to at the time, before a
tribunal of three (3) arbitrators, one of which shall be selected by the
Executive, one of which shall be selected by the Employer, and the third of
which shall be selected by the two (2) arbitrators so selected. Any award
issued as a result of such arbitration shall be final and binding between the
parties, and shall be enforceable by any court having jurisdiction over the
party against whom enforcement is sought. A ruling by the arbitrators shall be
non-appealable. The parties agree to abide by and perform any award rendered
by the arbitrators. If either the Executive or Employer seeks enforcement of
the terms of this Agreement or seeks enforcement of any award rendered by the
arbitrators, then the prevailing party (designated by the arbitrators) to such
proceeding(s) shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses (including
applicable travel expenses) from the non-prevailing party, in addition to any
other relief to which it may be entitled. If a dispute arises and one party
fails or refuses to designate an arbitrator within thirty (30) days after
receipt of a written notice that an arbitration proceeding is to be held, then
the dispute shall be resolved solely by the arbitrator designated by the other
party and such arbitration award shall be as binding as if three (3)
arbitrators had participated in the arbitration proceeding. Either the
Executive or the Employer may cause an arbitration proceeding to commence by
giving the other party notice in writing of such arbitration. Executive and
the Employer covenant and agree to act as expeditiously as practicable in order
to resolve all disputes by arbitration. Notwithstanding anything in this
section to the contrary, neither Executive nor the Employer shall be precluded
from seeking court action in the event the action sought is either injunctive
action, a 

17

restraining order or other equitable relief. The arbitration proceeding
shall be held in English. 

c. 
       
     Legal process in any action or proceeding referred to in the
preceding section may be served on any party anywhere in the world. 

d. 
       
     Except as expressly provided herein and except for injunctions
and other equitable remedies that are required in order to enforce this
Agreement, no action may be brought in any court of law and  EACH OF THE PARTIES
WAIVES ANY RIGHTS THAT IT MAY HAVE TO BRING A CAUSE OF ACTION IN ANY COURT OR
IN ANY PROCEEDING INVOLVING A JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW .
Each party acknowledges that it has been represented by legal counsel of its
own choosing and has been advised of the intent, scope and effect of this
Section 9.10 and has voluntarily entered into this Agreement and this Section
9.10. 

e. 
       
     Excluded from this Section 9.10 are any claims for temporary
injunctive relief to enforce Sections 7 and 8 of this Agreement. 

9.11

affect its construction or interpretation. All references to  Section  or  Sections  refer to the
corresponding Section or Sections of this Agreement unless otherwise specified. All words used in

Executive Employment Agreement 
Cash Bonus Description 

The Executive will, during the Employment Period, be permitted to participate in the BMC
Annual Executive Incentive Plan that may be in effect from time to time. During the employment
