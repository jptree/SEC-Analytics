         PART I 
        ITEM 1. BUSINESS   
         Results
        of Operations.  
         Earnings and Cash Flows from Operating Activities.    
        For the current
        quarter, Gold Hill Corporation ( the Company ) realized a small
        net loss which is detailed in the financial section of this report. The
        decrease in earnings and cash flows reported for the period was due primarily
        to expenses related to the N. Goldfield gold prospect located in Nevada.  
         Mineral
        Exploration.   
        During the
        quarter, the Company continued its search for gold in Nevada, focusing
        on drilling its north Goldfield prospect located 10-15 miles north of
        the town of Goldfield, where it holds 156 unpatented lode mining claims
        in a contiguous block.  
        As previously
        reported, the Company is exploring this part of Nevada for Goldfield-type
        deposits, which consist of rich gold-bearing quartz veins mined through
        vertical shafts. This type of deposit can be placed into production in
        less time and at much less cost than the large low-grade open pit deposits
        that are more environmentally sensitive. Also, a Goldfield-type depost
        can be highly profitable even in times of low gold prices because of their
        richness.  
        The drillsites
        were approved and bonded with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). During
        November and December, 2005, the Company drilled seven of the drillsites
        which included eight test holes amounting to a 6,070 ft of reverse circulation
        drilling. The drilling program was not completed due to winter weather
        conditions. Hopefully, drilling will be resumed in late spring or early
        summer depending upon the weather, drill rig availability, and approval
        by the BLM to change the location of our remaining three drillsites. To
        drill more than the approved ten drillsites will require going to a Plan
        of Operation with the BLM because it exceeds the five acres of surface
        disturbance allowed under a Notice of Operation which we are presently
        under. This can cause delays unless the BLM can make an exception.  
        Although
        only slightly anomalous gold was encountered in our drilling program to
        date, the holes confirmed the presence of a large rhyodacite intrusive,
        which at Goldfield 10 miles to the south is the primary host rock for
        the bonanza gold deposits discovered in 1902. At Goldfield, the rich deposits
        occur in siliceous  ledges  within an altered portion of the
        intrusive dacite associate with deep-seated faulting and fracturing along
        which the mineralizing solutions ascended. According to the USGS in their
        studies published in 1909, the prospective  ledge matter  which
        is the best material for the ore deposits that were developed along the
        contact of the rhyodacite intrusives can be hundreds of feet wide. Also,
        more recent studies have shown that all the characteristics of the Goldfield
        geologic model can be found in several of the major gold copper deposits
        located in the Pacific Rim area from South America to Indonesia and the
        Philippines. Further, our own surveys indicate that the frequencies of
        the rocks, minerals and trace elements making up the Goldfield deposits
        are detectable nowhere else in the region except over a broad area encompassing
        our prospect.  
       
        The price
        of gold is presently above $450 per ounce, which has inspired a significant
        amount of exploration. The result has been a shortage of drill rigs and
        a higher cost of exploration.   
        In the event
        of a discovery, the Company plans to drill confirmation holes.   
         
         ITEM 2: PROPERTIES   
         Oil and
        Gas Properties.   
        The Company is also continuing to focus efforts toward oil and gas exploration.
        The Company is currently in search of oil and gas prospects in east-central
        and northern Oklahoma where several prospects have been identified. The
        prospects are considered  wildcat  plays with significant potential,
        but as  wildcats  these prospects should be considered high-risk.
          
        The prospects
        currently under study have potential of 1 to 5 million barrels each, which
        if successful could favorably impact the share value of Gold Hill stock.
          
        In May 2004,
        Gold Hill participated in a well with West Star Producing Company to earn
        a 25% working interest in the South Wanette Layton Oil unit, which includes
        1520 unitized acres, five stripper wells, a tank battery and flow lines,
        and substantial oil reserves that may be recoverable by secondary recovery
        methods. The well was drilled to a depth of 4,000 feet and completed in
        the Calvin oil sand which was the main objective at about 3,860 ft. Initial
        production after a sand frac was about 700,000 cu ft of gas/day.   
        Management
        believes it to be an edge well close to a channel sand having greater
        porosity, permeability, and thickness. Oil is the primary target rather
        than gas. The gas well has been producing steadily since the first of
        April at a little over 200,000 cfg/day. Since the gas has a high (22%)
        nitrogen content, the well is not producing at full capacity due to market
        conditions.   
        The Layton
        oil sand was encountered in the well at about 3,100 feet and had good
        development.   
        The Company
        was expecting to have a drill rig available in March 2006, but have decided
        not to drill the Calvin Sand channel oil prospect at this time. Instead,
        the Company is preparing to acquire oil and gas leases on some adjoining
        acreage and plans to rework one of the old Layton oil wells that indicated
        substantial unrecovered oil reserves. With the current price of oil, development
        of the Layton oil potential is becoming quite attractive.   
        An oil reserve
        study made of the Layton oil sand unit (1,520 ac) indicates potentially
        recoverable oil reserves by improved waterflood methods to be several
        million barrels. The Layton oil zone was not adequately drained by previous
        production due to well spacing and failed waterflood attempts.  
        Management
        will operate test wells through completion after which West Star will
        continue as operator of the unit. Development of the Layton and Calvin
        zones will be pursued by subsequent drilling.  
         The current price of
        oil is over $65 per barrel, which has inspired a great deal of exploration,
        but has resulted in a shortage of drill rigs and much higher exploration
        costs. Drilling costs have nearly doubled in the past two years.  
          
   ITEM 3:
        OPERATIONS   
         General
        Operations.  
        Gold Hill will continue its conservative policy of avoiding debt and maintaining
        very low overhead costs. No salaries will be paid or allowed to accrue
        at this time. Gold Hill will not be charged for the use of office space
        currently provided by its principals. 
         
         Private Placement.  
        Gold Hill is continuing to make a private placement of its common stock
        in order to finance a portion of the costs of the projects described above.
        During this quarter, the Company sold 270,000 shares. 
         
         Competition and Risks.   
        The business environment is very competitive and there are a number of
        significant risks associated with oil and gas, and mineral exploration
        and production, including operations as well as exploration. Gold Hill
        Corporation intends to seek high-risk, high-potential prospects as well
        as lower-risk, lower-potential development ones. However, the major effort
        will be towards wildcat oil prospects with potential of 1,000,000 bbls
        or greater, and gold prospects with potential greater than 1,000,000 oz. 
          
         Regulation.
          
        The domestic exploration for mineral, including oil and gas is subject
        to various state and federal environmental laws, rules, and regulations.
        Operators in the industry are subject to the Clean Water Act and damages
        which could arise out of environmental pollution.  
         Corporate
        History.   
        Gold Hill
        Corporation is an exploration company focused on large wildcat gas and
        gold prospects, which if successful will significantly impact upon the
        value of the Company's stock. In addition to the Nevada Gold prospects,
        Gold Hill is active in oil and gas exploration. 
          
        Although
        Gold Hill is a public company, it is considered to be a developing company
        and its stock does not presently trade. Management's policy is to withhold
        stock trading until an important discovery is made. Gold Hill's management
        is comprised of experienced and successful explorationists who are qualified
        to carry forth the goals and aspirations of the company. The primary goal
        of the Company is to discover a major deposit while avoiding debt. At
        the same time, the company is focusing on retaining a large interest in
        each prospect so that a discovery will have a dramatic impact on stock
        value to the benefit of the shareholders.  
        Gold Hill's
        executive and operations offices are located in Oklahoma at 2233 West
        Lindsey, Suite 117, Norman, Oklahoma 73069 (telephone 405-321-8371). Unless
        the context otherwise requires, the term  Gold Hill  as used
        herein refers to Gold Hill Corporation.  
         
         FINANCIAL
        STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
