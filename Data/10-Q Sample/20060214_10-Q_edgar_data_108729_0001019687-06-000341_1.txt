1.       CHANGES OF COMPANY NAME AND FINANCIAL YEAR END DATE

         On July 9, 2005, the Board of Directors of Wyoming Oil and Minerals,
         Inc. (the "Company") approved a change of fiscal year end date from
         February 28 to March 31, effective as of July 9, 2005.

         Effective August 6, 2005, the Company changed its name from Wyoming Oil
         & Minerals, Inc. to Sun Motor International, Inc. to reflect the change
         in the Company's business.

2.       BASIS OF PRESENTATION

         (i)      The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements
                  of the Company and its subsidiaries have been prepared in
                  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
                  the United States of America for interim consolidated
                  financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q
                  and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the
                  information and notes necessary for comprehensive consolidated
                  financial statements.

                  In the opinion of the management of the Company, all
                  adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary
                  for a fair statement of the results for the nine-month periods
                  have been made. Results for the interim period presented are
                  not necessarily indicative of the results that might be
                  expected for the entire fiscal year. These condensed financial
                  statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated
                  financial statements and the notes thereto included in the
                  Company's Form 8K as filed with the Securities and Exchange
                  Commission on December 6, 2005.

         (ii)     On May 2, 2005, the Company executed an agreement to acquire
                  all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Bestip
                  Development International Limited ("Bestip"). Pursuant to the
                  terms of the agreement, the Company will issue a total of
                  28,000,000 shares of its common stock in exchange for all of
                  the capital stock of Bestip.

                  On June 15, 2005, the share exchange transaction was completed
                  and it constituted a reverse takeover transaction.
                  Accordingly, the purchase method under reverse takeover
                  accounting is adopted for the preparation of consolidated
                  financial statements. It means that the consolidated financial
                  statements are issued under the name of the legal parent, the
                  Company, but a continuation of the consolidated financial
                  statements of Bestip. The comparative figures are those of
                  Bestip.

3.       DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

         Pursuant to the reverse takeover transaction as detailed in note 2(ii),
         the Company is engaged in the designing and manufacturing of various
         types of micro motors for toys, electrical appliances, office
         equipment, automobile accessories, cameras, DVDs and MP3 players. The
         customers are mainly located in Japan, Taiwan, Europe, the United
         States of America, Canada and the People's Republic of China (the
         "PRC"). Details of geographic information are presented in note 10.

4.       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

         The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
         the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company
         balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

         USE OF ESTIMATES

         In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting
         principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
         management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
         amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets
         and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, as well as
         the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
         periods. These accounts and estimates include, but are not limited to,
         the valuation of accounts receivable, inventories, deferred income
         taxes and the estimation on useful lives of property, plant and
         machinery. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

         ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

         The Company extends unsecured credit to customers in the normal course
         of business and believes all accounts receivable in excess of the
         allowances for doubtful accounts to be fully collectible. If accounts
         receivable in excess of the provided allowance are determined
         uncollectible, they are charged to expense in the year that
         determination is made. The Company does not accrue interest on trade
         accounts receivable. Accounts receivable are due 30 to 180 days after
         the invoice date.

         INVENTORIES

         Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost
         determined on a weighted average basis.

         PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

         Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
         depreciation and amortization. Maintenance, repairs and betterments,
         including replacement of minor items, are charged to expense; major
         additions to physical properties are capitalized.

         Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line
         method over the estimated useful lives at the following annual rates :

                  Land                           Over the term of the lease
                  Buildings                      4%
                  Building improvements          20%
                  Machinery and equipment        10% - 20%

4.       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

         REVENUE RECOGNITION

         Revenues are recognized upon shipment of product, at which time title
         of goods has been transferred to the buyer.

         RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

         NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

         In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
         FASB Statement No. 154 "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections - a
         replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3". This
         statement replaces APB Opinion No. 20 "Accounting Changes" and FASB
         Statement No. 3 "Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
         Statements", and changes the requirements for the accounting for and
         reporting of a change in accounting principle. It applies to all
         voluntary changes in accounting principle and to changes required by an
         accounting pronouncement which does not include specific transition
         provisions. FASB No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior
         periods' financial statements of changes in accounting principle,
         unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific
         effects or the cumulative effect of the change. When it is
         impracticable to determine the period-specific effects of an accounting
         change on one or more individual prior periods presented, this
         statements requires that the new accounting principle be applied to the
         balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest
         period for which retrospective application is practicable and that a
         corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained
         earnings for that period rather than being reported in an income
         statement. When it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect
         of applying a change in accounting principle to all prior periods, this
         statement requires that the new accounting principle be applied as if
         it were adopted prospectively from the earliest date applicable.

         The adoption of the statement had no material impact on the Company's
         results of operation or financial position.

5.       INCOME TAX EXPENSES

         Income tax expenses represent the sum of current and deferred taxes,
         calculated at 17.5% on the estimated assessable profits of subsidiaries
         operating in Hong Kong.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Wyoming on February
23, 1973. Between April 2004 and the close of the reverse acquisition described
below, we had insignificant assets and had not generated significant revenues.

On June 15, 2005, Bestip Development International Limited, an International
Business Company organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands
("Bestip"), completed the reverse acquisition of our company, pursuant to which
we acquired all of the outstanding capital shares of Bestip in exchange for a
controlling interest in our company (the "Reorganization"). Pursuant to the
Securities Purchase Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated May 2, 2005 (the
"Purchase Agreement") by and among the Company, Bestip and the shareholders of
Bestip, at the closing of the Purchase Agreement, the shareholders of Bestip
transferred to the Company all of the outstanding capital shares of Bestip in
exchange for the issuance of 28,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock to
the shareholders of Bestip (representing approximately 95% of our total capital
stock outstanding after giving effect to its acquisition of Bestip). As a result
of the Reorganization, Bestip became our wholly-owned subsidiary.

Bestip was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on April 26, 1994 by Mr.
Simon Shi as the investment holding company of the Sun Motor Technology group of
companies ('Sun Motor"). Sun Motor designs, manufactures and markets micro
motors for a wide range of applications including automobile components, home
appliances, power tools, multimedia, personal care, and business equipment. Its
clients include several European and US based multinational corporations.

On June 24, 2005, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
a Current Report on Form 8-K that disclosed, among other things, the audited
financial statements of Bestip as of and for the fiscal years ended March 31,
2004 and 2003, and the unaudited balance sheet of Bestip as of December 31, 2004
and unaudited statements of income and cash flows for the nine months then
ended.

On July 11, 2005, the Company filed a definitive information statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with a proposed amendment to
our articles of incorporation to change our name to "Sun Motor International,
Inc." The amendment to the Company's articles of incorporation became effective
on August 6, 2005, upon filing with the Wyoming Secretary of State.

Since the stockholders of Bestip acquired approximately 95% of our issued and
outstanding common shares and the Bestip management team and board of directors
became the management team and board of directors of the Company, according to
FASB Statement No. 141 - "Business Combinations," this acquisition has been
treated as a recapitalization for accounting purposes, in a manner similar to
reverse acquisition accounting. In accounting for this transaction:

o     Bestip is deemed to be the purchaser and surviving company for accounting
      purposes. Accordingly, its net assets are included in the Company's
      balance sheet at their historical book values and the results of
      operations of Bestip have been presented for the comparative prior period;
      and
o     Control of the net assets and business of Wyoming Oil & Minerals, Inc. was
      acquired effective June 15, 2005. This transaction has been accounted for
      as a purchase of the assets and liabilities of Wyoming Oil and Minerals,
      Inc. by Bestip. The historical cost of the net liabilities assumed was $0.

                                       12

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 2004

NET SALES
Net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2005 increased by $1.7 million
(15.1%) to $13.4 million compared to $11.7 million for the three months ended
December 31, 2004. Higher net sales for the three months period were mainly
contributed by increasing sales to Japan.

COST OF SALES
Cost of sales for the three months ended December 31, 2005 totaled $10.2
million, or 75.9% of net sales, compared to $9.1 million, or 77.6% of net sales,
for the three months ended December 31, 2004. Our gross margin for the three
months ended December 31, 2005 was 24.1% compared to 22.4% in the three months
ended December 31, 2004. This improvement in gross margin reflected better
profitability of sales to the Japan market.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION
Depreciation and amortization expenses of back office maintained at the similar
level as same period of last year. They decreased by 0.16% as a percentage of
total net sales because of increased sales during the period.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $241,204 (11.4%) to
$2.35 million for the three months ended December 31, 2005 compared with $2.11
million for the same period last year. The increase was due primarily to
additional staff and facilities in preparation for expected sales increases in
coming year. As a percentage of total net sales, selling, general and
administrative expenses were 17.5% for the three months ended December 31, 2005
compared with 18.1% for the prior year period.

OTHER INCOME
Other income increased by $17,005 to $49,562 for the three months period ended
December 31, 2005. The increase was due mainly to increased interest rate and
additional interest income on bank deposits pledged as collateral for secured
banking facilities.

INTEREST AND CAPITAL LEASE CHARGES
Interest and capital lease charges increased by $180,475 (144.8%) to $305,086 as
a result of overall increase in interest rates and higher usage of bank
facilities used to finance expanding sales.

NET INCOME
Net income increased by $253,253 for the three months ended December 31, 2005 to
$445,211 from$191,958 for the same period of the prior year. Net income as a
percentage of net sales improved from 1.6% to 3.3% from the same period of last
year.

                                       13

FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 2004

NET SALES
Net sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2005 increased by $5.1 million
(13.6%) to $42.6 million compared to $37.5 million for the nine months ended
December 31, 2004. Higher sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2005 were
mainly contributed by increased sales to Japan, Taiwan and North America.

COST OF SALES
Cost of sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2005 totaled $33.0 million,
or 77.5% of net sales, compared to $29.2 million, or 78.0% of net sales, for the
nine months ended December 31, 2004. Our gross margin for the nine months ended
December 31, 2005 was 22.5% compared to 22.0% in the nine months ended December
31, 2004. This improvement in gross margin reflected changes in sales mix with
higher value-added in the period.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES
Depreciation and amortization expenses maintained at the similar level as same
period of last year. They decreased by 0.07% as a percentage of total net sales
because of increased sales during the period.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $612,253 or 9.4% for
the nine months ended December 31, 2005 to $7.15 million from $6.54 million for
the same period of the prior year. This increase was primarily a result of
higher advertising and promotional expenses and expansion of sales force during
the period. As a percentage of total net sales, selling, general and
administrative expenses declined to 16.8% from17.4% for the prior year period.

OTHER INCOME
Although additional interest income was earned on increased bank deposits
pledged as collateral for secured banking facilities, Other income decreased by
18.2% to $124,487 for the nine months period ended December 31, 2005 in
comparison with the same period prior year, as a result of the reduction in
interest bearing loan to a Director after the reverse acquisition on June 15,
2005.

INTEREST AND CAPITAL LEASE CHARGES
Interest and capital lease charges increased by $308,412 (74.0%) to $725,011,
reflecting overall increases in interest rate and higher utilization of banking
facilities to finance our growing sales during the period.

NET INCOME
Net income increased by $383,598 to $1,296,712 for the nine months ended
December 31, 2005 compared with $913,114 for the prior year period. This
increase reflected higher sales for the nine months combined with increasing
operating margins as shown in an improving net income to sales ratio (3.0% for
the nine months compared with 2.4% for the prior year period).

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company has relied primarily on cash flow from operations and bank loans for
its capital requirements. The Company had a working capital surplus of $714,518
as of December 31, 2005.

The Company believes that it will need approximately $2.5 million of an
additional working capital, in addition to our existing cash and cash
equivalents and cash generated by operations, in order to meet the Company's
working capital needs, capital expenditures, and commitments for the next 12
months. The Company will require additional financing to fund acquisitions or
additional facilities. In this connection, the Company is seeking to raise
additional funds through a placement of equity or debt or a combination thereof
although no assurance can be given that such funds will be available, or if
available, the terms thereof.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company does not have any market risk with respect to such factors as
commodity prices, equity prices, and other market changes that affect market
risk sensitive investments. A 10 basis point change in the Company's average
debt interest rate would not have a material effect on the Company's results of
operations.

                                       14

With respect to foreign currency exchange rates, the effect of a devaluation or
fluctuation of the HK dollar against the US dollar would affect the Company's
results of operations, financial position and cash flows, when presented in US
dollars (based on a current exchange rate) as compared to HK dollars.

As the Company's debt obligations are primarily short-term in nature, with fixed
interest rates, the Company does not have any risk from an increase in market
interest rates. However, to the extent that the Company arranges new borrowings
in the future, an increase in market interest rates would cause a commensurate
increase in the interest expense related to such borrowings.

The Company uses a broad range of raw materials in its products. Such materials
are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations, supply
and demand, currency fluctuations, and changes in governmental regulation. Price
increases will result in increases in cost of sales. The Company may not be able
to increase its product prices to offset these increased costs, and increasing
prices may result in reduced sales volume and profitability.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
The Company maintains a system of controls and procedures designed to provide
reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the financial statements and other
disclosures included in this report. As of December 31, 2005, under the
supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting them to
material information required to be included in our periodic filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during the nine months ended December 31, 2005 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal
control over financial reporting.

      consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those
      entities, particularly during the period in which this annual report is
      being prepared;

         (b) evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls
      and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
      effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of
      the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

         (c) disclosed in this report any change in the Company's internal
      control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's most
      recent fiscal quarter (the Company's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of
      an annual report) that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to
      materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial
      reporting; and

         5. The Company's other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based
      on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial
      reporting, to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of Company's
      board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

         (a) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
      or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
      reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record,
      process, summarize and report financial information; and

         (b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
      other employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal
      control over financial reporting.
