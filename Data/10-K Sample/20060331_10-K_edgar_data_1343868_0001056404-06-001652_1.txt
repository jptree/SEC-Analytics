Independent Accountants' Report

The Board of Directors and Stockholder
Option One Mortgage Corporation:

We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying management
assertion, that Option One Mortgage Corporation complied with the minimum
servicing standards set forth in the Mortgage Bankers Association of America's
Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2005. Management is responsible for Option One Mortgage
Corporation's compliance with those minimum servicing standards. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the
Company's compliance based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and,
accordingly, including examining, on a test basis, evidence about Option One
Mortgage Corporation's compliance with the minimum servicing standards specified
above and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on Option
One Mortgage Corporation's compliance with the minimum servicing standards.

In our opinion, management's assertion that Option One Mortgage Corporation
complied with the aforementioned minimum servicing standards as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2005 is fairly stated in all material respects.
