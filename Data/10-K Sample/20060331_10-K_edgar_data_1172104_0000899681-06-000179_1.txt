Exhibit 99.3    

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS  

To College Loan Corporation Trust I 
c/o College Loan Corporation  

We have examined the assertion made by management on College
Loan Corporation s compliance with Article V, paragraph 1 of Section 5.05
and Article XI, Section 11.01 of the Amended and Restated Indenture of Trust,
dated as of October 1, 2003, between College Loan Corporation Trust I, as
Issuer, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas as Indenture Trustee, for the
year ended December 31, 2005 included in the accompanying management assertion.
Management is responsible for the Trust s compliance with those
requirements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s
assertion about the Trust s compliance based on our examination.

Our examination was made in accordance with attestation
standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the
Trust s compliance with the requirements and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does
not provide a legal determination on the Trust s compliance with specified
requirements.   

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Trust
complied with the aforementioned requirements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2005 is fairly stated, in all material respects.
