WASHINGTON SCIENTIFIC INDUSTRIES, INC.

                                AND SUBSIDIARIES

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                   (Unaudited)

1.       CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

                  The consolidated balance sheet as of November 24, 1996, the
         consolidated statements of earnings for the thirteen weeks ended
         November 24, 1996 and November 26, 1995 and the consolidated statements
         of cash flows for the thirteen weeks then ended, respectively, have
         been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of
         management, all adjustments (which include normal recurring
         adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position,
         results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented have
         been made.

                  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included
         in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
         accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. Therefore, these
         condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in
         conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in
         the Company's 1996 annual report to shareholders. The results of
         operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the
         operating results for the full year.

2        DEBT AND LINE OF CREDIT:

                  On March 31, 1995, the Company amended its line of credit
         agreement and refinanced its term debt. The Agreement, which combines
         the line of credit and term debt, will expire on March 31, 1998 and is
         with the same bank with which the Company previously had its line of
         credit.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

                                       and

                              RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations:

                  Net sales of $5,591,000 for the quarter ending November 24,
         1996 increased $248,000 or 4.6% from the first quarter of the prior
         year. Primary changes in sales included a decrease in the computer
         market of $814,000, a decrease in the industrial compressor market of
         $638,000 and an increase in the agricultural market of $1,720,000.

                  Gross margin improved to 13.9% of sales in the first quarter
         of fiscal 1997 compared to 12.3% in the prior year's first quarter. The
         improved gross margin resulted primarily from cost reductions and
         improved manufacturing efficiencies.

                  Selling and administrative expense of $518,000 was comparable
         to the first quarter of the prior year.

                  Interest and other income was $386,000 higher than the
         comparable quarter of the prior year. The increase included $410,000
         net gain from the disposition of excess equipment related to completed
         or discontinued manufacturing programs.

                  Interest and other expense of $93,000 decreased $57,000 from
         the prior year's first quarter because of lower term debt balances.

                  In the first quarter of fiscal 1997, the Company recorded
         $5,800 of mandatory state income taxes and was able to recognize the
         benefit of a portion of its net operating loss carryforwards. The
         Company has not recorded the benefit of net operating losses and other
         net deductible temporary differences in the consolidated statement of
         operations due to the fact that the Company has not been able to
         establish that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be
         realized.

Liquidity and Capital Resources:

                  On November 24, 1996, working capital was $2,904,000 compared
         to $2,196,000 at August 25, 1996, an increase of $708,000, due
         primarily to an increase in accounts receivable. The ratio of current
         assets to current liabilities at November 24, 1996 and August 25, 1996
         was 2.0 to 1.0 and 1.87 to 1.0, respectively.

                  On November 24, 1996, the Company did not have an outstanding
         bank notes payable balance. As of that date the Company had cash and
         cash equivalents of $1,856,000.

                  It is management's belief that its internally generated funds
         combined with the line of credit will be sufficient to enable the
         Company to meet its financial requirements during fiscal 1997.

         Cautionary Statement:

                  The statements included herein which are not historical or
         current facts are "forward-looking statements" made pursuant to the
         safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995.
         There are certain important factors which could cause actual results to
         differ materially from those anticipated by some of the statements made
         herein, including the Company's ability to obtain additional
         manufacturing programs and retain current programs and other factors
         detailed from time to time in the Company's SEC reports, including the
