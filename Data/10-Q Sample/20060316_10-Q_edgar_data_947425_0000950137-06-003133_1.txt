ITEM 1: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

To the Audit Committee 
Professional Veterinary Products, Ltd. 
Omaha, NE

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Professional Veterinary
Products, Ltd. (a Nebraska Corporation) and subsidiaries as of January 31, 2006, and the related
statements of consolidated income for the three month and six month periods ended January 31, 2006
and 2005 and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the six month periods ended January 31,
2006 and 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the company s management.

We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of
applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which
is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly,
we do not express such an opinion.

Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the
accompanying financial statements in order for them to be in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with auditing standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Professional
Veterinary Products, Ltd. and subsidiaries as of July 31, 2005, and the related statements of
income and retained earnings, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in
our report dated October 4, 2005, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial
statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet as of July 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the balance
sheet from which it has been derived.

Notes to Condensed, Consolidated Financial Statements 
January 31, 2006 (unaudited) 
(in thousands, except share data)

NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION: 

The accompanying condensed, consolidated financial statements of Professional Veterinary
Products, Ltd., and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Company) have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial
information and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the SEC). Accordingly, these condensed, consolidated financial statements do
not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States for complete financial statements.

The information contained in the financial statements is unaudited. The statements reflect
all normal and recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair
statement of the results for the interim periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

These condensed, consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2005 filed with the SEC. The Company follows the
same accounting policies in preparation of interim financial statements. These policies are
presented in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included on Form 10-K referred to
above.

The results of operations and cash flows for the six months ended January 31, 2006 are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2006 or
any other period. Certain amounts from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the
current period s presentation.

NOTE 2   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS: 

In October 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position
(FSP) No. FAS 13-1,  Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period . No. FAS
13-1 addresses the accounting for rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred
during a construction period. No. FAS 13-1 requires that rental costs associated with ground or
building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period shall be recognized as
rental expense. In addition, No. FAS 13-1 requires that rental costs shall be included in income
from continuing operations. No. FAS 13-1 is effective and shall be applied to the first reporting
period beginning after December 15, 2005. The adoption of this FASB Staff Position is not expected
to have a material effect on the Company s financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

In February 2006, FASB issued FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 155,
 Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments.  SFAS No. 155 amends SFAS No. 133,  Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,  and SFAS No. 140,  Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.  This statement improves
financial reporting by eliminating the exemption from applying SFAS No. 133 to interests in securitized
financial assets and improves financial reporting by allowing a preparer to elect fair value
measurement at acquisition, at issuance, when a previously recognized financial instrument is
subject to a remeasurement event, or on an instrument-by-instrument basis. This Statement is
effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity s first
fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006.

NOTE 2   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS (continued): 

The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s financial
position, cash flows or results of operations.

NOTE 3   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT: 

Major classes of property and equipment consists of the following:

NOTE 4   LINE OF CREDIT: 

In December 2004, the Company increased the amount of the revolving line of credit from
$25,000 to $40,000. This agreement is scheduled to expire in January 2008. The short-term
borrowing amounts outstanding under this credit facility were $23,063 and $2,721 at January 31,
2006 and July 31, 2005, respectively. Interest is payable at a variable rate, subject to change
each fiscal quarter, equal to the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a percentage based on
the Company s leverage ratio. The line of credit is secured by substantially all of the Company s
assets.

Under these debt and credit agreements, the Company is required to maintain certain net worth
and leverage ratios. In addition, the Company s debt agreements contain a number of covenants,
among other things, that restrict the Company s ability to pay dividends. The Company was in
compliance with all covenants under the borrowing agreements at January 31, 2006 and July 31, 2005.

NOTE 5   EARNINGS PER SHARE: 

SFAS No. 128,  Earnings per Share  promulgates accounting standards for the computation and
manner of presentation of the Company s earnings per share data. Under SFAS No. 128, the Company
is required to present basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is computed
by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of
redeemable common shares outstanding for the period. In accordance with SFAS No. 150, the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period does not include the shares
subject to mandatory redemption. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that
could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock that would cause further dilution. There are no securities that
are convertible to common stock that would cause further dilution.
The weighted-average number of
redeemable common shares outstanding was 1,285 and 1,238 at January 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

(in thousands, except share data)

NOTE 6   SHARES SUBJECT TO MANDATORY REDEMPTION AND REDEEMABLE COMMON STOCK: 

The Company is authorized to issue 30,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $1.
Issued and outstanding shares amounted to 2,011 at January 31, 2006 and 2,019 at July 31, 2005.
Holders of common stock are entitled to a) one vote for each share held on matters submitted to a vote of
stockholders, b) a ratable share of dividends declared and c) in the event of liquidation or
dissolution, a ratable share of monies after liabilities. Shareholders are not permitted to
dispose of their stock except by a sale back to the Company. The shareholder must give the Company
written notice of the proposed sale and the Company must redeem for cash the share of stock within
ninety days of receiving such notice, at the price the shareholder paid for the share. In
accordance with SFAS No. 150, shares held by single member limited liability companies and sole
proprietorships that are mandatorily redeemable upon death of the holder at the price the
shareholder paid for the share were reclassified as long-term liabilities as Shares Subject to
Mandatory Redemption. All other shares are designated as Redeemable Common Stock.

There were 2 and 10 redeemable common shares subscribed but unissued as of January 31, 2006
and July 31, 2005, respectively. The amounts receivable on these shares reduced Redeemable Common
Stock by $4 and $16 at January 31, 2006 and July 31, 2005, respectively. Accounts receivable
arising from Redeemable Common Stock sales is presented as a deduction from Redeemable Common Stock
to the extent such receivables were not paid in cash prior to the date of the report. Accounts
receivable arising from Redeemable Common Stock sales excludes Shares Subject to Mandatory
Redemption. No finance charges have been generated on any existing payment plan for any share of
Redeemable Common Stock.

There were 0 and 3 Shares Subject to Mandatory Redemption subscribed but unissued as of
January 31, 2006 and July 31, 2005, respectively. The amounts receivable on these shares reduced
Shares Subject to Mandatory Redemption by $0 and $6 at January 31, 2006 and July 31, 2005,
respectively. Accounts receivable arising from Shares Subject to Mandatory Redemption sales are
presented as a deduction from Shares Subject to Mandatory Redemption to the extent such receivables
were not paid in cash prior to the date of the report. No finance charges have been generated on
any existing payment plan for any Share Subject to Mandatory Redemption.

NOTE 7   POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS: 

The Company has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). The SERP is a nonqualified
defined benefit plan to which the Company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key
employees upon retirement based upon the employees  years of service and compensation. For the six
months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, benefits accrued and expensed were $217 and $258,
respectively. The plan is an unfunded supplemental retirement plan and is not subject to the
minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). While the
SERP is an unfunded plan, the Company is informally funding the plan through life insurance
contracts on the participants. The life insurance contracts had cash surrender values of $1,292
and $1,106 at January 31, 2006 and July 31, 2005, respectively.

NOTE 7   POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS (continued): 

Net Periodic benefit costs for the Company s SERP for the six months ended January 31, 2006
and January 31, 2005 include the following components:

NOTE 8   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES: 

Stock Redemption    -  The Company is required by its Articles of Incorporation to repurchase
stock within ninety days of receiving written notice from the shareholder requesting redemption of
their stock. The redemption amount is the original purchase price of the stock paid by the
shareholder. The Company was contingently liable for $5,964 and $5,967 as of January 31, 2006 and
July 31, 2005, respectively.

Major Customer, Major Suppliers and Credit Concentrations     Other financial instruments, which
potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, are trade accounts receivable and
trade payables. One customer comprised a significant individual receivable consisting of 10.5% and
11.1% at January 31, 2006 and July 31, 2005, respectively. One vendor comprised a significant
individual payable consisting of 53.9% and 38.3% of the Company s payables at January 31, 2006 and
July 31, 2005, respectively. The Company purchased inventory from one vendor consisting of 39.1%
and 31% of all purchases at January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005, respectively.

Other     The Company is subject to claims and other actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. Some of these claims and actions may result in lawsuits where the Company is a
defendant. Management believes that the ultimate obligations if any, which may result from
unfavorable outcomes of such lawsuits, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial
position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company and such obligations, if any, would be
adequately covered by insurance.

Agreements    Effective October 1, 2005, the Company entered into a lease with two individuals
who are residents of the State of Texas. Pursuant to the lease, the Company leases the premises
located in a building, which contains approximately 15,625 rentable square feet, in Hereford,
Texas. The lease has an initial term of five (5) years, ending on September 30, 2010. The Company
also has the option to renew the initial term of the lease for two successive three year periods by
providing the landlord notice of its election to renew thirty days prior to the commencement of
such renewal term. The Company intends to use the premises for storing and warehousing animal
health products.

On November 7, 2005, the Company executed a lease with a Kentucky limited liability company.
Pursuant to the lease, the Company will lease certain premises located in Lexington Kentucky. The
lease has an initial term of seventeen months, commencing November 1, 2005, and ending March 31,
2007. The first installment of rent was due and payable upon execution of the lease. The Company
intends to use the premises for storing and warehousing veterinary products.

NOTE 9   SEGMENT INFORMATION: 

The Company has three reportable segments: Wholesale Distribution, Logistics Services and
Direct Customer Services. The Wholesale Distribution segment is a wholesaler of animal health
products. This segment distributes products primarily to licensed veterinarians or business
entities comprised of licensed veterinarians. The Logistics Services segment provides logistics
and distribution service operations for vendors of animal health products and business to business
type transactions. The Logistics Services segment distributes products primarily to other animal
health companies. The Direct Customer Services segment acts as a supplier of animal health
products to the producer or consumer. Animal health products are shipped to locations closer to
the final destination. The segment s trucking operations transport the products directly to the
producer or consumer.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies as detailed in the Company s consolidated financial statements and
footnotes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2005,
filed with the SEC. The Company evaluates performance based on profit or loss from operations
before income taxes. The Company s reportable segments are strategic business units that serve
different types of customers in the animal health industry. The separate financial information of
each segment is presented consistent with the way results are regularly evaluated by the chief
operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.

Since the Company s reportable segments all provide essentially the same products and
services, the Company believes it would be impracticable to report the revenue from external
customers for each product and service or each group of similar products and services in accordance
with paragraph 37 of SFAS No. 131,  Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information.

ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of
operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes that are included in this quarterly report.

Forward-Looking Statements  

This Quarterly Report on   Form 10-Q   contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements are contained principally in the section entitled  Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  These forward-looking statements involve known
and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance
or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but
are not limited to, statements about: 

the current economic environment affecting the Company and the markets it serves;  

sources of revenues and anticipated revenues, including the contribution from the growth
of new products and markets;  

estimates regarding the Company s capital requirements and its need for additional financing;  

the Company s ability to attract customers and the market acceptance of its products;  

our ability to establish relationships with suppliers of products; and  

plans for future products and services and for enhancements of existing products and services.  

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as  may,   intend, 
 might,   will,   should,   could,   would,   expect,   believe,   estimate,   predict, 
 potential,  or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions intended to identify
forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our current views with respect to future
events and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties. Given these
uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. Also, these statements
represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on   Form 10-Q  ,
and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. 

These statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations
of our management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may
differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. The following factors, among
others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements:
decreased demand for our products or services or loss of one or more of our major customers;
surplus inventories; loss of one or more of our major vendors; recessionary economic cycles;
strikes, work slow downs, or work stoppages at our vendors  facilities, poor weather conditions,
decreases in manufacturer or vendor rebates, increases in interest rates; and increases in the
prices paid for goods. Readers should review and consider these factors along with the various
disclosures we make in public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Overview  

Professional Veterinary Products, Ltd. provides distribution services of animal health
products through three business segments, Wholesale Distribution, Logistics Services, and Direct
Customer Services. The Wholesale Distribution segment is a wholesaler of animal health products.
The Logistics Services segment provides logistics and distribution service operations for vendors
of animal health products and business to business type transactions. The Direct Customer Services
segment is a supplier of animal health products to the producer or consumer.

12

Table of Contents   

We generate most of our net sales and other revenue by providing pharmaceuticals, vaccines,
supplies, equipment and other animal health related items to our customers through our wholesale
distribution segment. The main factor that impacts our net sales and other revenue is the
Company s ability to offer a broad product line combined with our excellent and knowledgeable
customer service. We also derive approximately 15% of our sales and other revenue from our direct
customer services segment.

During the quarter ended January 31, 2006, the Company s gross profit increased $1.0 million
or 9.6% compared to the prior period. The gross profit increase was primarily due to the increase
in sales margin and slight increases in sales performance incentives earned by the company. For
the quarter, net income decreased by $.1 million to $1.4 million compared to $1.5 million in the
prior comparative period. The net income decrease was primarily due to the increase in interest
expense principally on outstanding debt. Due to increases in sales margin earned by the Company
and increases in sales performance incentives, the estimated shareholder performance rebate accrued
for the six months ended January 31, 2006 was $2.1 million versus $680 thousand for the prior
comparative period.

Vendor rebates have historically been the highest during the Company s second fiscal quarter
ended January 31. These considerable vendor rebate programs are planned to include annual targets
to be achieved based on the calendar year. The Company intends to increase the profitability with
the addition of new vendor rebate programs and refocusing product offerings with key vendors.

Looking forward, we believe that costs of goods from manufacturers and labor expenses will
continue to be the most pressing issues facing the industry and us in the foreseeable future and
will continue to impact our profitability.

Results of Operations  

The following discussion is based on the historical results of operations for the three month
and six month periods ended January 31, 2006 and 2005.

Summary Consolidated Results of Operations Table For Three Months Ended January 31, 2006  

Three months ended January 31, 2006 as compared to three months ended January 31, 2005  

Net sales and other revenue for the three month period ended January 31, 2006 increased $13.1
million to $103.8 million compared to $90.7 million for the same period the previous year. The
increase in net sales and other revenue resulted primarily due to an increase in sales to customers
in the animal health industry of $13.8 million to achieve the Company s vendor rebate program sales
performance goals. Partially offsetting this increase was an increase in the shareholder rebate of
$.7 million. The Company s shareholder rebate increased from increases in sales margin and sales
performance incentives earned by the Company. The Company calculates rebates which are credited to
its shareholders. The rebates are calculated, according to current practices of management, based
on eligible purchases by the shareholder during the period. Such rebates are made on a pro rata
basis to shareholders based on the aggregate amount of products purchased by each shareholder
during the period. Rebates are included in the Company s financial statements and are netted
against sales and accounts receivable on the Company s financial statements.

Gross profit for the three month period ending January 31, 2006 increased $1.0 million to
$11.9 million compared to $10.9 million for the same period the previous year. This increase is
primarily attributable to increased sales margin on the purchases of animal health products of $1.4
million and sales performance incentives earned from the manufacturers of animal health products of
$.3 million. Partially offsetting this increase was an increase in the shareholder rebate of $.7
million. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales and other revenue was 11.5% compared to 12.0%
for the same period the previous year.

Operating, general and administrative expenses for the three month period ending January 31,
2006 increased $1.0 million to $9.5 million compared to $8.5 million for the same period the
previous year. The increase in operating, general and administrative expenses resulted primarily
from an increase in payroll, payroll taxes, and employee benefits of $.4 million, an increase in
credit card fees paid to the bank of $.1 million, an increase in computer support expense to
support e-commerce of $.1 million, and an increase in depreciation expense of $.1 million. These
expenses as a percentage of net sales and other revenue were 9.1% compared to 9.3% for the same
period the previous year.

Operating income changed nominally during the three month period ending January 31, 2006
compared to the previous year.

January 31, 2006, compared to $(152) thousand for the same period the previous year. Interest
expense increased to $482 thousand for the three month period ending January 31, 2006, from $281
thousand for the same period in the previous year while interest income decreased to $120 thousand
compared to $129 thousand in the prior period. The increase in the Company s other income and net
interest (expense) resulted primarily from a decrease in interest income and additional interest
expense of $201 thousand due principally on outstanding debt. The decrease in interest income
resulted from a decrease in the finance charges on past due accounts receivable of $9 thousand.

Net income decreased by $.1 million to $1.4 million compared to $1.5 million for the same
period the previous year. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in interest expense
principally on outstanding debt.

Operating Segments   Three months ended January 31, 2006 as compared to three months ended January
31, 2005  

The Company has three reportable segments: Wholesale Distribution, Logistics Services, and
Direct Customer Services. The Wholesale Distribution segment is a wholesaler of animal health
products to veterinarians. This segment distributes products primarily to Company shareholders,
who are licensed veterinarians or business entities comprised of licensed veterinarians.

The Logistics Services segment provides animal health products to other animal health
wholesalers. The Logistics Services segment serves business-to-business type transactions.

The Direct Customer Services segment is a supplier of animal health products to the producer
or consumer. Animal health products are shipped to locations closer to the final destination. The
segment s trucking operations transport the products directly to the producer or consumer.

The Company s reportable segments are strategic business units that serve different types of
customers in the animal health industry. The separate financial information of each segment is
presented consistent with the way results are regularly evaluated by the Company s management, who
decides how to allocate resources and assesses performance. For additional quantitative segment
information, see Note 9 of the Company s Condensed, Consolidated Financial Statements at January
31, 2006.

Wholesale Distribution  

Net sales and other revenue for the three month period ending January 31, 2006 increased by
14.6% or $13.1 million. Net sales and other revenue for the three month period ending January 31,
2006 totaled $103.0 million compared to $89.9 million for the same three month period in the prior
fiscal year. The increase in net sales and other revenue resulted primarily because of an increase
in sales to customers in the animal health industry of $8.2 million to achieve the Company s vendor
rebate program sales performance goals and an increase in sales to consolidated affiliates of $5.7
million. Partially offsetting this increase was an increase in the shareholder rebate of $.7
million and a decrease in earnings in consolidated affiliates of $.1 million.

Gross profit increased by $.5 million to $10.2 million compared to $9.7 million for the same
three month period in the prior fiscal year. This increase is primarily attributable to increased
sales margin on the purchases of animal health products of $.9 million and sales performance
incentives earned from the manufacturers of animal health products by this segment of $.1 million.
Partially offsetting this increase was an increase in the shareholder rebate of $.7 million. Gross
profit as a percentage of total revenue was 9.9% for the three month period ending January 31, 2006
compared to 10.8% for the same three month period in the previous year.

compared to the previous year. In order to achieve the Company s vendor rebate program sales
performance goals for the three month period ending January 31, 2006 compared to the previous year,
the Company needed to purchase additional inventory. The purchase of additional inventory
increased the majority of the loan proceeds that were on the Company s revolving line of credit
during the three month period ending January 31, 2006, compared to the previous year.

animal health industry of $14.1 million to achieve the Company s vendor rebate program sales
performance goals. Partially offsetting this increase was an increase in the shareholder rebate of
$1.4 million. The Company s shareholder rebate increased from increases in sales margin and sales
performance incentives earned by the Company. The Company calculates rebates which are credited to
its shareholders. The rebates are calculated, according to current practices of management, based
on eligible purchases by the shareholders during the period. Such rebates are made on a pro rata

Seasonality in Operating Results  

The Company s quarterly sales and operating results have varied in the past and will likely
continue to do so in the future. Historically, the Company s sales are seasonal with peak sales in
the spring and fall. The cyclical nature is directly tied to the significant amount of business
the Company does in the livestock sector. Product use cycles are directly related to certain
medical procedures performed by veterinarians on livestock during the spring and fall.

In the last few years, the Company has been selling more companion animal related products.
These products tend to have a different seasonal nature which minimally overlaps the livestock
business

19

Table of Contents   

cycles. The net result is a reduction of the cyclical seasonal nature of the business. Minimizing
the cyclical nature of the Company s business has allowed for more efficient utilization of all
resources.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The Company expends capital primarily to fund day-to-day operations and expand those
operations to accommodate sales growth. It is necessary for the Company to expend necessary funds
to maintain significant inventory levels in order to fulfill its commitment to its customers.
Historically, the Company has financed its cash requirements primarily from short term bank
borrowings and cash from operations. At the end of the six month period ended January 31, 2006,
there were no additional material commitments for capital expenses.

The Company also has expended significant funds in the lease and purchase of its facilities.
In March 2002, the Company signed a lease agreement with Kinsley Equities II Limited Partnership
for 70,000 square feet of warehouse space in York, Pennsylvania for an initial term of five years.
The Company uses this facility to ship products to its customers in that geographical area of the
United States. In June 2003, the Company exercised an option to lease an additional 17,500 square
feet of space in that facility for a total of 87,500 square feet of leased space in York,
Pennsylvania.

In October 2002, the Company purchased 10 acres of land adjacent to the current corporate
facility in Omaha, Nebraska for approximately $808,000 in order to provide the Company with land
available for future expansion of its Omaha facility. In addition to the purchase of the
additional 10 acres in Omaha, the Company made significant capital investments in equipment and
furniture, including the purchase of office furniture, computer software, warehouse and computer
equipment. The Company purchased some of the equipment in February 2003 by using a capital lease
in the amount of $343,075, with interest at 4.58% and monthly payments of $10,218 through February
2006. Subsequent to January 31, 2006, this remaining equipment capital lease obligation was
settled in full.

In May 2003, the Company amended and restated its Revolving Credit Agreement with U.S. Bank
and established a revolving line of credit facility and a term loan facility. The Company s
subsidiaries, ProConn, LLC and Exact Logistics, LLC also were named as borrowers. As part of this
amendment and restatement, the Company, its subsidiaries, and U.S. Bank entered into an Amended and
Restated Loan Agreement and the Company converted $4,000,000 of the Company s then current
obligations under the original Revolving Credit Agreement into a term loan and into a Term
Promissory Note in the same amount, which accrues interest at a fixed rate of 5.77% per annum. The
Company, ProConn and Exact Logistics are jointly and severally liable for the obligations under the
Term Promissory Note, which matures June 1, 2008. Currently, the Term Promissory Note is payable
in 59 installments of principal and interest in the amount of $76,904 which are payable monthly
through May 1, 2008. As of June 1, 2008, all unpaid principal and interest will be due. The
Company may not prepay the Term Promissory Note without the prior written consent of U.S. Bank and
the payment of a prepayment fee based on the net present value of the amount of principal to be
prepaid. As of January 31, 2006, the Company had $2,099,285 outstanding on the Term Promissory
Note.

On December 28, 2004, the Company, ProConn, Exact Logistics and U.S. Bank entered into a
Second Amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement whereby U.S. Bank agreed to increase
the Company s revolving line of credit from $25,000,000 to $40,000,000 and the Company agreed to
amend its financial covenants under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. The increased
revolving line of credit is evidenced by a Revolving Promissory Note for $40,000,000 among U.S.
Bank, the Company, ProConn and Exact Logistics. The Company, ProConn and Exact Logistics are
jointly and severally liable for the obligations under the Revolving Promissory Note, which matures
on January 1, 2008. The actual principal amount outstanding varies as the Company borrows and
repays its obligations throughout the term of the loan. Advances made under the Revolving
Promissory Note accrue interest at a variable rate, subject to change each fiscal quarter, equal to
the LIBOR Rate plus a percentage based on the Company s leverage ratio. As of January 31, 2006,
the variable interest rate at which the Revolving Promissory Note accrued interest was 6.07% and
the Company had approximately $23.1 million outstanding thereunder.

20

Table of Contents   

Both the Term Promissory Note and the Revolving Promissory Note are secured by a first and
second mortgage held by U.S. Bank on the Company s Omaha facility as well as a security interest on
all of the Company s accounts receivable, inventory, chattel paper, equipment, instruments,
investment property, deposit accounts, documents, letter of credit rights, fixtures, all personal
property and general intangibles. The Amended and Restated Loan Agreement imposes a number of
conditions which must be met by the Company, ProConn and Exact Logistics on an on-going basis prior
to the U.S. Bank s disbursement of loan funds under the Revolving Promissory Note, including,
without limitation, meeting certain financial covenants and providing the Bank with annual audited
financial statements and monthly interim financial statements. Failure to comply with these
conditions will result in a default under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, Revolving
Promissory Note and Term Promissory Note which permits U.S. Bank to accelerate the payment of the
outstanding principal and accrued interest under both notes.

In April 2005, the Company signed a lease agreement with U.S. Bancorp Equipment Finance for
voice picking equipment to be used in Omaha, Nebraska and York, Pennsylvania facilities. The
initial amount of the lease is in the amount of $207,996, with interest at 6.19% and monthly
payments of $6,346 through April 2008.

Effective October 1, 2005, the Company entered into a Lease with two individuals who are both
residents of the State of Texas. Pursuant to the Lease, the Company leases the premises located in
a building, which contains approximately 15,625 rentable square feet, in Hereford, Texas. The
Lease has an initial term of five (5) years, ending on September 30, 2010. The Company also has
the option to renew the initial term of the Lease for two successive three year periods by
providing the landlord notice of its election to renew thirty days prior to the commencement of
such renewal term. The Company intends to use the premises for storing and warehousing veterinary
products. The initial amount of the lease is in the amount of $4,557 per month.

upon execution of the Lease. The Company intends to use the premises for storing and warehousing
veterinary products. The initial amount of the lease is in the amount of $3,614 per month.

In addition, the Company s Bylaws require the Company to repurchase stock within ninety (90)
days of receiving written notice from a shareholder requesting redemption of their stock or within
one year following the date of death. The redemption amount is the original purchase price of the
stock paid by the shareholder subject to adequate resources being available. The Company s
Articles of Incorporation prohibit shareholders from selling, assigning or otherwise transferring
their common stock to any person or entity, other than to the Company. The Company was
contingently liable for $6.0 million as of January 31, 2006.

The SEC issued disclosure guidance for  critical accounting policies.  The SEC defines
 critical accounting policies  as those that require application of management s most difficult,
subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect
of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.

The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Company s
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended July 31, 2005 filed with the SEC. Not all of these significant account
policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates.
However, management of the Company is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the
preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These estimates and assumptions impact the reported
amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the
date of the consolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically
and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period they are determined to be necessary. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. Following are some of the Company s critical accounting policies
impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates.

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition  

The Company derives its revenue primarily from the sale of products, consignment sales and
agency agreements. Revenues are recognized as product is received by the customer and related
services are performed in accordance with all applicable revenue recognition criteria. For these
transactions, the Company applies the provisions of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,  Revenue
Recognition.  The revenue from the  buy/sell  and consignment transactions are recorded at gross.
Agency sales are transactions presented on a net basis. The Company recognizes revenue when there
is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, title and risk of loss have passed, delivery has occurred
or the contractual obligations are met, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of
the related receivable is reasonably assured.

Inventories  

Inventories consist substantially of finished goods held for resale and are valued at the
lower of cost or market, not in excess of net realizable value. Cost is determined primarily by
the weighted average cost method.

Major Customer, Major Suppliers and Credit Considerations  

Other financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk, are trade accounts receivable and trade payables. One customer comprised a significant
individual receivable consisting of 10.5% and 11.1% at January 31, 2006 and July 31, 2005,
respectively. One vendor comprised a significant individual payable consisting of 53.9% and 38.3%
of the Company s payables at January 31, 2006 and July 31, 2005, respectively. The Company
purchased inventory from one vendor consisting of 39.1% and 31.0% of all purchases at January 31,
2006 and January 31, 2005, respectively.

Income Taxes  

The Company provides for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which
deferred income taxes are recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary
differences and carry-forwards that result from events that have been recognized either in the
financial statements or the income tax returns, but not both. The measurement of current and
deferred income tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of enacted laws. Valuation
allowances are recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not
that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  

Annually, the Company subjects goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with
indefinite lives to an impairment test, in accordance with accounting procedures generally accepted
in the United States. Other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives.

Other identifiable intangible assets consist of the Company trademark and loan origination
fees. Trademarks have an indefinite life and therefore are not amortized. Loan origination fees
constitute the Company s identifiable intangible asset subject to amortization. Amortization of
the loan origination fees is computed on a straight-line basis over the term of the related note.
Amortization expense is included in operating, general, and administrative expenses on the
Consolidated Statements of Income.

Recent Accounting Changes  

In October 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position
(FSP) No. 31-1,  Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period.  No. FAS 13-1
addresses the accounting for rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred during
a construction period. No. FAS 13-1 requires that rental costs associated with ground or building
operating leases that are incurred during a construction period shall be recognized as rental
expense. In addition, No. FAS 13-1 requires that rental costs shall be included in income from
continuing operations. No. FAS 13-1 is effective and shall be applied to the first reporting
period beginning after December 15, 2005. The adoption of this FASB Staff Position is not expected
to have a material effect on the Company s financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

In February 2006, FASB issued FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 155,
 Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments.  SFAS No. 155 amends SFAS No. 133,  Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,  and SFAS No. 140,  Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.  This statement improves
financial reporting by eliminating the exemption from applying SFAS No. 133 to interests in
securitized financial assets and improves financial reporting by allowing a preparer to elect fair
value measurement at

23

Table of Contents   

acquisition, at issuance, when a previously recognized financial instrument is subject to a
remeasurement event, or on an instrument-by-instrument basis. This Statement is effective for all
financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that
begins after September 15, 2006. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s financial
position, cash flows or results of operations.

ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The Company is exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates. The Company
does not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes.

The interest payable on the Company s revolving line of credit is based on variable interest
rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates. If interest rates on variable
rate debt increased by .61 percentage points (a 10% change from the interest rate as of January 31,
2006), assuming no change in the Company s outstanding balance under the line of credit
(approximately $23.1 million as of January 31, 2006), the Company s annualized income before taxes
and cash flows from operating activities would decline by approximately $140 thousand.

Under our Amended and Restated Loan Agreement with U.S. Bank dated May 12, 2003, the Company
and its subsidiaries executed a Term Promissory Note in the amount of $4,000,000 which accrued
interest at a fixed rate of 5.77% per annum and matures June 1, 2008. Currently, the Term
Promissory Note is payable in 59 monthly installments of principal and interest in the amount of
$76,904 which are payable through May 1, 2008. As of June 1, 2008, all unpaid principal and
interest will be due. The company may not prepay the Term Promissory Note without the prior
written consent of U.S. Bank and the payment of a prepayment fee based on the net present value of
the amount of principal to be prepaid. As of January 31, 2006, the Company had $2,099,285
outstanding on the Term Promissory Note.

Under our Second Amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement with U.S. Bank, our
revolving line of credit was increased to $40,000,000 and evidenced by a Revolving Promissory Note
dated December 28, 2004, among U.S. Bank, the Company, and its subsidiaries. The Revolving
Promissory Note matures on January 1, 2008. The actual principal amount outstanding varies as the
Company borrows and repays its obligations throughout the term of the loan. Interest is payable at
a variable rate, subject to change each fiscal quarter, equal to the London InterBank Offered Rate
(LIBOR) plus a percentage based on the Company s leverage ratio. Advances made under the Revolving
Promissory Note accrue interest, and at January 31, 2006, the variable interest rate at which the
Revolving Promissory Note accrued interest was 6.07% and the Company had approximately $23.1
million outstanding thereunder.

Both the Term Promissory Note and the Revolving Promissory Note are secured by a first
mortgage held by U.S. Bank on the Company s Omaha facility as well as a first security interest on
all of the Company s accounts receivable, inventory, chattel paper, equipment, instruments,
investment property, deposit accounts, documents, letter of credit rights, fixtures, personal
property and general intangibles.

ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Section 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the  Exchange Act )) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as of the end of the period covered by this annual
report. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by
us in the reports that we file or

24

Table of Contents   

submit under the Exchange Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to Company management (including
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) to allow timely decisions regarding
disclosures, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Under the direction of the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company evaluated its disclosure controls
and procedures, did not identify any material weakness, and believes that its disclosure controls
and procedures were effective at January 31, 2006.

The Company intends to continue to monitor its disclosure controls and procedures, and if
further improvements or enhancements are identified, the Company will take steps to implement such
improvements or enhancements. It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is
based upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that such design will succeed in achieving its stated objective under all potential future
conditions, regardless of how remote. However, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial
Officer believe the Company s disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance that
the disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Changes in Internal Controls 

During the quarter ended January 31, 2006, there were no significant changes in our internal
control over financial reporting that have materially affected or that are reasonably likely to
affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting, the Company took no corrective
actions regarding our internal controls, and the Company is not aware of any other factors that
could significantly affect these controls.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 

The Company has confidence in its internal controls and procedures. Nevertheless, the
Company s management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) believes
that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable
assurance and cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the internal control system
are met, and no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Further, the design of
an internal control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitation in all internal control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been
detected.
