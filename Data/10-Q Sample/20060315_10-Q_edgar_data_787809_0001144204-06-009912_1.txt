      January
      31, 2006 

      (Unaudited) 

1.     
             
                 Basis
                of Presentation  

Our
      unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules
      and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and should be read
      in
      conjunction with our October 31, 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-KSB. Certain
      information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial
      statements prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
      (GAAP) have been omitted or condensed pursuant to such rules and
      regulations. 

Our
      unaudited financial statements include all adjustments consisting of normal
      recurring adjustments which are, in the opinion of our management, necessary
      to
      present a fair statement of our financial position as of January 31, 2006 and
      the results of operations and cash flows for the three month periods ended
      January 31, 2006 and 2005. Results of operations for these periods are not
      necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full
      year. 

2.       Critical
      Accounting Policies  

Principles
      of consolidation  

The
      consolidated financial statements include our operations and the operations
      of
      our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and
      account balances have been eliminated. 

Cash
      and cash equivalents  

We
      consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity date of three months
      or
      less when purchased to be cash equivalents. 

Inventories  

Inventories
      are stated at the lower of cost (average cost method) or market. 

Property
      and equipment  

Property
      and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed principally using
      straight-line depreciation over the estimated useful lives of individual assets
      or the remaining terms of leases. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over
      a
      period of three to five years, furniture and fixtures range from three to five
      years and leasehold improvements are depreciated over the term of the lease.
      Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to earnings when they are
      incurred. Upon disposition of an asset, any gain or loss is reflected in current
      earnings. 

7 

Intangible
      assets  

As
      a
      result of the acquisition of the IMPAC Companies, we determined with the help
      of
      valuation specialists, that the customer list has a value of $1,000,000. It
      is
      being amortized over ten years. We also determined that the trade names have
      a
      value of $1,800,000 and have an indefinite life and are therefore not amortized.
      Instead the recorded value of the trade names is tested for impairment at least
      annually.. 

We
      review
      long-lived assets for impairment whenever circumstances and situations change
      such that there is an indication that the carrying amount may not be
      recoverable. We believe that there had been no impairments of our long-lived
      assets through January 31, 2006. 

Sales  

We
      sell
      our products to independent representatives and directly to third party
      end-users. Revenue on the sale of product is recognized at the time of shipment
      when title to the product passes to the independent representative or third
      party end-user. Customers do not have the right to return products shipped
      to
      them. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts on an estimated
      basis. 

3.       Stock
      Options  

Effective
      August 1, 2005, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock options
      under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R ( SFAS 123R ),
 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.  SFAS 123R requires stock options to
      be expensed over the vesting period based on the fair value at the date the
      stock option was granted. No stock options have been issued since August 1,
      2005.  

Prior
      to
      August 1, 2005, we applied APB Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to
      Employees,  and the related interpretations in accounting for our Amended and
      Restated Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the  Plan ). 

If
      compensation expense for our stock options were previously recognized based
      on
      their fair value as prescribed in SFAS 123R, the impact on net income and
      earnings per share would be as follows: 

8 

4.       Derivative
      Instruments and Hedging Activities  

We
      recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. On the date the
      derivative instrument is entered into, we generally designate the derivative
      as
      either (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or
      of an
      unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedge), or (2) a hedge of a forecasted
      transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related
      to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge). Changes in the fair value
      of a derivative that is designated as and meets all the required criteria for
      a
      fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability
      that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current period
      earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as and
      meets all the required criteria for a cash flow hedge are recorded in
      accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings as the
      underlying hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of a
      derivative that is not designated as a hedge are recorded immediately in
      earnings.  

We
      document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as
      well
      as our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge
      transactions. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective
      as a
      hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, we will
      discontinue hedge accounting prospectively.  

We
      may
      enter into interest rate swap agreements to change the fixed/variable interest
      rate mix of the debt portfolio in order to maintain an appropriate mix of
      fixed-rate and/or variable-rate debt within the parameters set by management.

At
      January 31, 2006, we were not a party to any derivative instruments or hedging
      activities.  

5.       Inventory  

The
      components of inventories at January 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005 are as
      follows: 

9 

6.       Intangible
      Assets  

The
      components of intangible assets at January 31, 2006 are as follows: 

Amortization
      of customer lists and deferred financing costs was $35,600 for the three months
      ended January 31, 2006. Ongoing charges will be $33,078 per quarter thru fiscal
      year 2010. The subsequent amortization charge will be $25,000 per quarter for
      from 11/1/2010 through 12/30/2012.  

7.       Long
      Term Debt  

The
      Facility contains a number of financial and other covenants which, if not
      satisfied, could result in an acceleration of the maturity of our indebtedness
      to the bank. As of January 31, 2006, we were in compliance with all covenants.

8.       Segment
      information  

Management
      reviews its domestic and European operations to evaluate performance and
      resources. Management has aggregated its operations into one industry segment.
      Geographic information is as follows: 

11 

Item
      2.        Management s
      Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operations  

The
      following discussion and analysis provides information which our management
      believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of
      operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in
      conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere
      in this report. 

In
      order
      to provide greater understanding of the effects of the operations of the IMPAC
      Companies upon our overall financial performance, we have disclosed, where
      we
      have deemed it appropriate to do so, the results attributable to our operations
      separately from those of the IMPAC Companies. In those cases, we have used
      the
      phrases 

Domestic
                Operations  to refer to the operations of our company in the United
                States, whether or not those operations pertained to sales made to
                customers located inside or outside of the United States;
                and 

IMPAC
                Operations  to refer to the operations of the IMPAC Companies, whether or
                not those operations pertained to sales made to customers of the
                IMPAC
                Companies located in Europe or
                elsewhere. 

Results
      of Operations  

Three
      Months Ended January 31, 2006 Compared To Three Months Ended January 31,
      2005   

Total
      revenues for the three months ended January 31, 2006 were $8,343,001, which
      represented a 13% increase over total revenues of $7,363,417 for the three
      month
      period ended January 31, 2005. The increase can be primarily attributed to
      increased sales volume. 

Our
      cost
      of sales for the three months ended January 31, 2006 was $3,767,761 (45.2%
      of
      sales) compared to $3,357,331 (45.6% of sales) for the same period in fiscal
      2005. The improvement in margin can be attributed to a better product mix and
      increased absorption of overhead because of the higher sales volume.

Selling,
      general and administrative expenses were $2,648,659 for the three months ended
      January 31, 2006 compared to $2,343,665 for the same period in fiscal 2005.
      This
      increase of approximately $305,000 was due primarily to: 

Research
      and development expenses increased for the three months ended January 31, 2006
      to $598,322 from $590,650 for the same quarter in 2005.  

12 

Our
      income from operations for the three months ended January 31, 2006 was
      $1,328,259 compared to $1,071,771 for the comparable period in fiscal 2005.
      The
      24% increase was primarily due to an increase in sales and gross margin.

Our
      interest expense for the three months ended January 31, 2006 was $21,061
      compared to $68,546 for the same period last year. Interest expense was reduced
      due to the lower level of borrowing in 2006.  

Our
      net
      income before the provision for income taxes for the three months ended January
      31, 2006 was $1,305,828 compared to $1,012,008 for the comparable period in
      fiscal 2005. The 29% increase is primarily due to an increase in sales and
      gross
      margin. 

Our
      effective tax rate for the three month period ended January 31, 2006 was 40.0%
      compared to 39.5% for the three months ended January 31, 2005.  

Our
      net
      income for the three months ended January 31, 2006 was $782,583 compared to
      $612,473 for the comparable period in fiscal 2005. The 28% increase in net
      income is primarily due to the increase in sales and gross margin.  

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources  

At
      January 31, 2006, we held $1,611,924 in cash, and we had $4,491,778 in accounts
      receivable. The increase in cash of $306,383 since October 31, 2005 resulted
      from an increase in cash from operations of $924,966, offset by cash used in
      financing activities of $562,537 (repayment of debt) and a use of cash in
      investing activities of $57,998. 

Our
      working capital at January 31, 2006 was $10,240,177 as compared to $9,958,805
      at
      year-end October 31, 2005. This increase primarily was a result of decreases
      in
      our accounts payable, accrued expenses and long term debt, offset by a decrease
      in inventory. 

As
      of
      January 31, 2006, we had an additional $3,250,000 of available credit under
      the
      Facility. In addition, we have unused lines of credit in Europe which amount
      to
      approximately $605,000.  

Off-Balance
      Sheet Arrangements  

We
      entered into an interest rate swap contract in November 2002 which converted
      the
      variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt. This contract entails the exchange of
      fixed- and floating-rate interest payments periodically over the life of the
      three-year agreement. This agreement was terminated July 1, 2005. The fair
      value
      of the interest rate swap at January 31, 2005, was $8,092. We were not a party
      to any other off-balance sheet arrangement during the fiscal year ended October
      31, 2005 or the quarter ended January 31, 2006.  

Item
      3.       Quantitative
      and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  

Our
      primary exposures to market risks include fluctuations in interest rates on
      our
      long term debt as well as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

13 

Foreign
      Exchange Rate Risk   

Except
      for inter-company sales between our subsidiaries in the European Union, we
      deal
      almost exclusively in US dollars. Our exposure to currency exposure is mitigated
      by the buy/sell relationship that exists between our Domestic Operations and
      our
      IMPAC Operations. Our foreign exchange risk was estimated as a potential
      hypothetical change in currency exchange between the US Dollar and the European
      Euro of 10%. The resulting hypothetical result would not materially affect
      the
      operating results.  

Interest
      Rate Risk   

Due
      to
      its short-term duration, the fair value of our cash and investment portfolio
      at
      January 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005 approximated its carrying value. Interest
      rate risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from
      a
      hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates for securities contained in the
      investment portfolio. The resulting hypothetical fair value was not materially
      different from the year-end carrying values.  

Our
      total
      long-term debt outstanding, excluding the current portion, at January 31, 2006
      and October 31, 2005 was $839,671 and $1,402,219, respectively, and consisted
      mainly of a revolving credit facility. The interest rates on these debt
      instruments are primarily variable and range from 5.22% to 6.5% at January
      31,
      2006 and 5.22% to 5.75% at October 31, 2005. Due to the immaterial amounts
      of
      the outstanding debt, a hypothetical change of 10% in interest rates would
      not
      have a material effect on our near-term financial condition or results of
      operations. 

Item
      4.       Controls
      and Procedures  

Our
      management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer
      and
      Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
      procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that
      evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
      concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
      the
      end of the period covered by this report.  There has been no change in our
      internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter
      covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
      to
      materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item
      1A       Risk
      Factors  

This
      report on Form 10-Q is the first SEC filing made by the Company since it ceased
      to be a small business issuer. The Company did not include risk factors in
      its
      Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005. The
      risk factors set forth below are the initial set of risk factors disclosed
      by
      the Company in a filing made by it pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

Fluctuations
      in our quarterly and annual operating results make it difficult to predict
      our
      future performance   

Our
      quarterly and annual operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future
      due
      to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control. As a result
      of
      the fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, we believe that
      quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily
      meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance.
      Factors that may affect our future operating results include:  

14 

the
                timing, number and size of orders from, and shipments to, our customers,
                as well as the relative mix of those orders;

the
                timing and market acceptance of our or our competitors  new products,
                product enhancements or technologies;

changes
                in our or our competitors  pricing policies;

the
                timing and amount of any inventory write downs;

our
                ability to obtain sufficient supplies of critical components;

foreign
                currency fluctuations;  

costs
                associated with the acquisition of other businesses, product lines
                or
                technologies;  

our
                ability to integrate acquired businesses, product lines or technologies;
                and  

general
                economic conditions, both domestically and internationally.

Our
      future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological
      change in the markets in which we compete   

The
      markets for single point temperature measurement and thermal imaging equipment
      are characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product
      introductions, enhancements and modifications. Our success will depend in large
      part on our ability to develop new technologies that anticipate changing
      customer requirements. We may need to make substantial capital expenditures
      and
      incur significant research and development costs to develop and introduce new
      products and enhancements. If we fail to timely develop and introduce new
      technologies, our business, financial condition and results of operations would
      be adversely affected. From time to time, we or our competitors may announce
      new
      products, product enhancements or technological innovations that have the
      potential to replace or shorten the life cycles of our products and that may
      cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products, resulting in
      inventory obsolescence.  

We
      must successfully introduce new or enhanced products to be successful

Our
      future success depends on our ability to continue to improve our existing
      products and to develop new products using the latest technology that can
      satisfy customer requirements. For example, we believe that our long term
      success will depend on increasing acceptance of our line of thermal imaging
      systems, sales of which we expect to generate a substantial amount of our annual
      revenue. We are also investing a significant amount of our financial resources
      in the enhancement of some of our other existing products. We cannot be certain
      that we will successfully complete these enhancements within the necessary
      time
      period or that customers will accept our new products, or any future products.
      Our failure to complete the enhancement of these products or the failure of
      our
      current or future products to gain or maintain market acceptance could have
      a
      material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
      operations.  

15 

Competition
      in the market for thermal imaging equipment is intense and our failure to
      compete effectively would adversely affect our business   

Competition
      in the markets for our products is intense. The speed with which companies
      can
      identify new applications for non-contact temperature measurement systems and
      devices, develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities
      at low prices to the market are important competitive factors. We believe the
      principal competitive factors in our markets are product features, reliability
      and price. In the case of our thermal imaging systems, a further factor
      affecting our ability to compete is the availability of microbolometers from
      the
      limited number of manufacturers who can supply that device in quantities
      sufficient to meet our needs. Additionally, our products compete indirectly
      with
      other lower cost products, such as thermocouples. Finally, many of our
      competitors have greater financial, technical, research and development and
      marketing resources than we do. All of these factors result in greater
      challenges from our existing competitors as well as increasing competition
      from
      new competitors and require us to continue to invest in, and focus on, research
      and development and new product innovation. No assurance can be given that
      we
      will be able to compete effectively in the future, which would have a material
      adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Dependence
      on limited source suppliers of components of our products exposes us to risks
      that could result in delays in satisfying customer demand, increased costs
      and
      loss of revenue   

In
      some
      cases, we rely on a limited source of suppliers to provide certain components
      for our products. Accordingly, we could experience a shortage in the supply
      of
      some of our components. In particular, we acquire the microbolometers or
      uncooled focal plane arrays that we integrate into our Mikroscan thermal imaging
      product lines from two third party sources of that component. Our business,
      financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely
      affected in the event that either (i) the number of microbolometers delivered
      to
      us is insufficient to satisfy our requirements or (ii) we are obligated to
      purchase microbolometers in excess of the number we require.  

Based
      on
      past experience, we expect to occasionally receive late deliveries or to
      experience inadequate supplies of certain components. If the components provided
      by any significant supplier were to become unavailable, our manufacturing
      operations would be disrupted. Unless we could identify and qualify acceptable
      replacement components or redesign our products with different components,
      we
      might not be able to obtain necessary components on a timely basis or at
      acceptable prices. Any extended interruption in the supply of sole or limited
      source components would have a material adverse effect on our business,
      financial condition and results of operations.  

16 

Our
      future success depends in part on attracting and retaining key senior management
      and qualified technical and sales personnel   

Our
      future success depends on the efforts and continued services of our key
      executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical and sales
      personnel. Significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot
      assure the retention of our key technical and sales personnel or our ability
      to
      attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified technical and sales
      personnel as may be required in the future. We also cannot assure that employees
      will not leave and subsequently compete against us. If we are unable to attract
      and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of
      operations could be adversely affected.  

Any
      acquisition or equity investment we make could disrupt our business and harm
      our
      financial condition and results of operations   

We
      have
      in the past, and may in the future, acquire complementary businesses or
      technologies or enter into joint ventures. We may experience difficulties in
      assimilating the personnel, operations, products and technology acquired in
      any
      future acquisitions or investments we make. Additionally, we could lose the
      key
      personnel from any of the companies that we acquire, incur unanticipated costs
      and assume new liabilities. Any of these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing
      business, distract our management and employees and increase our expenses.
      Furthermore, we might have to incur additional debt or issue additional equity
      securities to pay for any future acquisitions. The issuance of any additional
      equity securities could dilute our existing shareholders  ownership. No
      assurance can be given that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any
      acquisition or that such acquisition will not have a material adverse effect
      on
      our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

We
      face risks from international sales and currency fluctuations

We
      market
      and sell our products worldwide. International sales account for a significant
      portion of our revenue. For the year ended October 31, 2005 and the three months
      ended January 31, 2006, international sales accounted for 58% and 54%
      respectively, of our net sales revenue. Our international sales are subject
      to a
      number of risks, including:  

the
                imposition of governmental controls;

restrictions
                on the export of critical technology;

trade
                restrictions;  

difficulty
                in collecting receivables;  

inadequate
                protection of intellectual property;

labor
                union activities;  

changes
                in tariffs and taxes;  

difficulties
                in staffing and managing international operations;

political
                and economic instability; and  

general
                economic conditions.  

17 

Historically,
      currency fluctuations have not materially affected our operating results.
      However, as a result of the increasing significance of sales made by, and the
      operating expenses incurred by our IMPAC Operations in currencies other than
      US
      dollars, changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our Domestic
      Operations sales and our IMPAC Operations sales are denominated or the costs
      incurred by our Domestic Operations and our IMPAC Operations could in the future
      cause fluctuations in our operating results. With respect to international
      sales
      denominated in US dollars, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies
      relative to the US dollar could make our products less price-competitive. The
      same may prove to be true with regard to the relative competitiveness of our
      IMPAC products in the event of a decrease in the Euro relative to the US dollar.
      No assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse
      effect on our future international sales and operations and, consequently,
      on
      our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

We
      may not be successful in maintaining and obtaining the necessary licenses to
      conduct operations abroad, and Congress may prevent proposed sales to foreign
      governments   

Licenses
      are required from government agencies under the Export Administration Act,
      the
      Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 and the Arms Export Control Act of 1976
      for
      export of some of our products. We can give no assurance that we will be
      successful in obtaining these licenses. Failure to obtain or delays in obtaining
      these licenses would prevent or delay us from selling our products outside
      the
      United States and would have a material adverse effect on our business,
      financial condition and results of operations.  

Our
      products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial damage or
      warranty claims   

Our
      products use complex system designs and components that may contain errors
      or
      defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products
      or
      release new versions. While we have not yet had to recall a product, if any
      of
      our products are defective, we might be required to redesign or recall those
      products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such an event could
      result in significant expenses, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and
      that
      of our products which would have a material adverse effect on our business,
      financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, product defects
      could result in substantial product liability. We maintain product liability
      insurance, but cannot be certain that it is adequate or will remain available
      on
      acceptable terms.  

Our
      inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid
      infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our
      business   

Our
      ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends,
      in
      part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without
      infringing the rights of others. To accomplish this, we rely on trademark and
      trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements, contractual provisions and,
      to a
      lesser degree, on patents, to protect our proprietary rights. Virtually all
      of
      our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not
      covered by patents, making them more difficult to protect. Four US patents
      have
      been issued to us covering technology related to our infrared thermometry
      products. None of these patents was material to our overall business. At the
      present time, we have two US patent applications pending relative to our thermal
      imaging technology. If those applications are granted, we cannot be certain
      that
      our patents or the trademarks that we hold will not be challenged or
      circumvented by competitors. Likewise, we cannot be certain that measures taken
      to protect our proprietary rights will adequately deter their misappropriation
      or disclosure. We also cannot be certain that we will obtain additional patents
      or trademarks on our technology. Any failure by us to meaningfully protect
      our
      intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business,
      financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, because intellectual
      property does not necessarily represent a barrier to entry into the thermal
      imaging industry, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain
      our
      competitive advantage or that competitors will not develop capabilities equal
      or
      superior to ours.  

18 

Litigation
      over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry. We
      cannot assure you that we will not be the subject of patent or other litigation
      in the future. Defending intellectual property lawsuits and related legal and
      administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and
      significant diversion of effort of our personnel. An adverse determination
      in a
      patent suit or in any other proceeding to which we may be a party could subject
      us to significant liabilities. An adverse determination could require us to
      seek
      licenses from third parties. If licenses were not available on commercially
      reasonable terms or at all, our business could be harmed.  

Our
      stock price could fluctuate   

Trading
      in our common stock in the past has been characterized by single digit prices
      at
      thin daily volumes with occasional volume spikes. Although various reports
      regarding our stock are published from time to time, we are unaware that any
      analyst covers our stock. Such being the case, many occurrences and events
      can
      materially change the price of our stock on a given day or over a short period
      of time. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our stock price include:

fluctuations
                in our quarterly operating results; 

local,
                regional, national and international economic trends that affect
                the
                purchasing capacities of our customers and potential customers;

new
                product announcements by us or our competitors;

real
                or perceived changes in the markets for our products;
                and 

announcements
                by us, or our competitors, of new or enhanced products or technological
                innovations or in the pricing of
                products.  

Future
      issuances of our common stock could dilute current shareholders and adversely
      affect the market.  

We
      have
      the authority to issue up to 15,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 1,000
      shares of convertible preferred stock without shareholder approval. We also
      have
      authority to issue options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock
      and preferred stock without shareholder approval.  These future issuances
      could be at values substantially below the price paid for our common stock
      by
      our current shareholders.   

Future
      sales of our common stock also could adversely affect the
      market.  

19 

Future
      sales of our common stock into the market, including sales by our officers,
      directors and principal shareholders, may also depress the market price of
      our
      common stock. Sales of these shares of our common stock or the market s
      perception that these sales could occur may cause the market price of our common
      stock to fall.  These sales also might make it more difficult for us to
      sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price
      that
      we deem appropriate or to use equity as consideration for future acquisitions.
       The exercise of outstanding options will dilute our common shareholders
      and may depress the price of our common stock. 

Provisions
      in our certificate of incorporation and New Jersey law may deter takeover
      efforts that might be beneficial to shareholder value.  

We
      have
      the authority to issue up to 1,000 shares of convertible preferred stock without
      shareholder approval.  The issuance of convertible preferred stock by our
      Board of Directors could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our
      common stock.  An issuance of convertible preferred stock could result in a
      class of outstanding securities that would have preferences with respect to
      voting rights and dividends and in liquidation over the common stock and could,
      upon conversion or otherwise, have all of the rights of our common stock.
 Our Board of Directors  authority to issue convertible preferred stock
      could discourage potential takeover attempts or could delay or prevent a change
      in control through merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise by making
      these attempts more difficult or costly to achieve.

      functions): 

(a)     all
      significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation

      report financial information; and  

(b)     fraud,
      whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
      a
      significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial
      reporting.
