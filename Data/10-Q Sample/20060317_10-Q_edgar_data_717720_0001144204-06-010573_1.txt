                  STATEMENTS  

Significant
                  Accounting Policies - Note 1:   

In
                  the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated
                  condensed financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting
                  of
                  normal recurring accruals except as noted below) considered necessary
                  for
                  a fair presentation. This report should be read in conjunction
                  with the
                  financial statements and footnotes contained in the Company's annual
                  report on Form 10-K, dated July 29, 2005 and Form 10-K Amended,
                  dated
                  August 26, 2005 for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2005. Results
                  of
                  operations covered by this report may not be indicative of the
                  results of
                  operations for the entire year. 

Value
                  Line, Inc. (the "Company") is incorporated in New York State and
                  carries
                  on the investment periodicals and related publications and investment
                  management activities formerly performed by Arnold Bernhard   Co.,
                  Inc. (the "Parent") which owns approximately 86% of the issued
                  and
                  outstanding common stock of the Company. 

Principles
                  of Consolidation:  

The
                  consolidated condensed financial statements include the accounts
                  of the
                  Company and all of its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
                  accounts
                  and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Revenue
                  Recognition:  

Subscription
                  revenues are recognized ratably over the terms of the subscriptions.
                  Accordingly, the amount of subscription fees to be earned by servicing
                  subscriptions after the date of the balance sheet is shown as unearned
                  revenue. 

Investment
                  management fees (except 12b-1 fees) are recorded as the related
                  services
                  are performed (see note 6). Service and distribution fees collected
                  under
                  rule 12b-1 are recorded in the Consolidated Condensed Statements
                  of Income
                  based upon the average daily net asset values of the respective
                  Value Line
                  mutual funds. 

Valuation
                  of Securities:  

The
                  Company's securities classified as available for sale consist of
                  shares of
                  the Value Line Mutual Funds and government debt securities accounted
                  for
                  in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
                  No.115,
                  "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities".
                  The
                  securities are valued at market with unrealized gains and losses
                  on these
                  securities reported, net of applicable taxes, as a separate component
                  of
                  Shareholders' Equity. Realized gains and losses on sales of the
                  securities
                  available for sale are recorded in earnings on trade date and are
                  determined on the identified cost method. 

The
                  Company classifies its securities available for sale as current
                  assets. It
                  does so to properly reflect its liquidity and to recognize the
                  fact that
                  it has assets available for sale to fully satisfy its current liabilities
                  should the need arise. 

Trading
                  securities held by the Company are valued at market with unrealized
                  gains
                  and losses included in earnings. 

Market
                  valuation of securities listed on a securities exchange and
                  over-the-counter securities traded on the NASDAQ national market
                  is based
                  on the closing sales prices on the last business day of each month.
                  In the
                  absence of closing sales prices for such securities, and for other
                  securities traded in the over-the-counter market, the security
                  is valued
                  at the midpoint between the latest available and representative
                  asked and
                  bid prices. 

Valuation
                  of open-ended mutual fund shares are based upon the net asset values
                  of
                  the shares as calculated by such funds. 

Market
                  valuation of the Company's fixed maturity government debt obligations
                  are
                  valued utilizing quoted prices provided by a third party pricing
                  service. 

Advertising
                  Expenses:  

The
                  Company expenses advertising costs as
                  incurred.

           NOTES
          TO THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Reclassification:

Certain
                  items in the prior year financial statements have been reclassified
                  to
                  conform to the current year presentation. 

Income
                  Taxes: 

The
                  Company computes its income tax provision in accordance with the
                  provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
                  "Accounting for Income Taxes". Deferred tax liabilities and assets
                  are
                  recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that
                  have
                  been reflected in the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.
                  Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the
                  differences between the book values and the tax bases of particular
                  assets
                  and liabilities, using tax rates currently in effect for the years
                  in
                  which the differences are expected to reverse.  

Earnings
                  per Share, basic   fully diluted: 

Earnings
                  per share are based on the weighted average number of shares of
                  common
                  stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during each
                  year. 

Cash
                  and Cash Equivalents: 

For
                  purposes of the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows,
                  the
                  Company considers all cash held at banks and short term liquid
                  investments
                  with an original maturity of less than three months to be cash
                  and cash
                  equivalents. As of January 31, 2006 and April 30, 2005, cash equivalents
                  included $9,784,000 and $5,546,000 respectively, invested in the
                  Value
                  Line money market funds. 

Use
                  of Estimates: 

The
                  preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
                  accepted
                  accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
                  assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures.
                  Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.

                  income.

At
                  January 31, 2006 and April 30, 2005 the Company held both equity
                  securities and U.S. Government debt securities that are classified
                  as
                  Available for Sale on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.
                  The
                  change in valuation of these securities, net of deferred income
                  taxes, has
                  been recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the

The
                  Company acts as investment adviser and manager for fourteen open-ended
                  investment companies, the Value Line Family of Funds. The Company
                  earns
                  investment management fees based upon the average daily net asset
                  values
                  of the respective Value Line mutual funds. In addition, effective
                  July 1,
                  2000, twelve of the fourteen Value Line Mutual Funds adopted a
                  service and
                  distribution plan under rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act
                  of 1940.
                  Effective September 18, 2002, the remaining two funds for which
                  Value Line
                  is the adviser adopted a service and distribution plan under rule
                  12b-1 of
                  the Investment Company Act of 1940. Further, the Company earned
                  brokerage
                  commission income on securities transactions executed by Value
                  Line

                  fully
                  disclosed basis through non-affiliated brokers, who received a
                  portion of
                  the gross commission. Pending a review of effecting trades for
                  the Value
                  Line Funds, VLS in November 2004 suspended effectuation of trades
                  through
                  VLS for any of the Value Line Funds.

                  which includes fee waivers for certain of the Value Line Mutual
                  Funds. For the nine months ended January 31, 2005, investment management

                  fees
                  during the nine months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 were $7,498,000

For
                  the nine months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company was
                  reimbursed $700,000 and $387,000, respectively, for payments it
                  made on

                  reminded
                  that the Parent may make additional purchases from time to time
                  in the

Deferred
                  income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the
                  financial
                  reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities.
                  The tax effect of temporary differences giving rise to the Company's
                  deferred tax liability are primarily a result of unrealized gains
                  on the
                  Company's available for sale securities portfolios.  

Business
                  Segments - Note 8:   

The
                  Company operates two reportable business segments: Publishing and
                  Investment Management Services. The publishing segment produces
                  investment
                  related periodicals in both print and electronic form, and licensing
                  fees.
                  The investment management segment provides advisory services to
                  the Value
                  Line family of mutual funds, as well as institutional and individual
                  clients. The segments are differentiated by the products and services
                  they
                  offer. 

The
                  accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described
                  in the
                  summary of significant accounting policies. The Company allocates
                  all
                  revenues and expenses, except for depreciation and income from
                  securities
                  transactions related to corporate assets, between the two reportable
                  segments.

Contingencies
                  - Note 9:   

On
                  September 17, 2003 the Company commenced an action in New York
                  Supreme
                  Court, seeking damages in an unspecified amount, against a small
                  mutual
                  fund company pertaining to a contemplated transaction. The Company
                  was
                  countersued for alleged damages in excess of $5,000,000. The action
                  was
                  settled in November, 2004 without a material adverse effect on
                  the
                  Company. A related entity of the defendant in the New York action
                  brought
                  suit against the Company and certain Directors in Federal Court
                  in Texas
                  in March, 2004 based on the same transaction. On the Company's
                  motion,
                  that action has been transferred from Texas to New York. On March
                  2, 2006
                  the Federal Judge in New York granted the Company's motion dismissing
                  three causes of action. The court allowed one cause of action to
                  continue
                  at this time. Although the ultimate outcome of the litigation is
                  subject
                  to the inherent uncertainties of any legal proceeding, based upon
                  Counsel's analysis of the factual and legal issues and the Company's
                  meritorious defenses, it is management's belief that the expected
                  outcome
                  of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's
                  consolidated results of operations and financial
                  condition. 

By
                  letter dated June 15, 2005, the staff of the Securities and Exchange
                  Commission requested the Company as part of a preliminary inquiry
                  to
                  provide documents relating to, among other things, trades for the
                  Company's proprietary accounts, and the effectuation and execution
                  of
                  trades through VLS for the Value Line Funds. The Company is cooperating
                  with the preliminary inquiry.

                DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  

                FINANCIAL
                CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
                OPERATIONS. 

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources  

The
      Company had working capital as of January 31, 2006 of $57,083,000 which included
      cash and short-term securities at market value of $74,918,000. 

The
      Company s cash flows from operations of $11,047,000 for the nine months ended
      January 31, 2006 was 63% lower than cash flow of $29,859,000 for the comparable
      period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease in cash flow from operations
      was
      primarily due to the liquidation of the Company s trading securities portfolio
      during the prior fiscal year. Exclusive of the net cash flows from the trading
      securities portfolio activity, cash flows from operations were $5,943,000 higher
      than the prior fiscal year s. Net cash inflows of $1,141,000 from investing
      activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2006 primarily resulted from
      proceeds received from sales of callable U.S. Government debt securities. Net
      cash outflows of $3,781,000 during the first nine months of the prior fiscal
      year resulted from sales of equity securities to partially finance the payment
      of the Company s special dividend offset by a redeployment of the net proceeds
      from sales of trading securities and callable fixed income securities into
      fixed
      income, government debt obligations. Cash outflows from financing activities
      of
      $7,485,000 during the first nine months of fiscal year 2006 represent the
      payment of the Company s quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share for each of the
      first three quarters. Cash outflows from financing activities for the same
      period of fiscal year 2005 of $182,162,000 reflect the Company s quarterly
      dividends of $.25 per share for each of the first three quarters as well as
      a
      special $17.50 dividend paid to all shareholders on May 19, 2004. 

Management
      believes that the Company s cash and other liquid asset resources used in its
      business together with the future cash flows from operations will be sufficient
      to finance current and forecasted operations. Management anticipates no
      borrowing for fiscal year 2006.    

Operating
      Results  

Net
      income for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 of $17,727,000 or $1.78 per
      share was $1,331,000 or 8% above net income of $16,396,000 or $1.64 per share
      in
      fiscal 2005. Net income for the third quarter ended January 31, 2006 of
      $6,694,000 or $0.67 per share was $2,037,000 or 44% above net income of
      $4,657,000 or $0.46 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. Operating
      income of $25,670,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 was $7,120,000
      above operating income of $18,550,000 for the same period of the last fiscal
      year, a 38% increase for the period. Operating income of $8,037,000 for the
      three months ended January 31, 2006 was $1,600,000 or 25% above operating income
      of $6,437,000 for the same period of last fiscal year. The Company s income from
      securities transactions of $3,571,000 was 56% below last year s for the nine
      months ended January 31, 2006. For the third quarter of fiscal 2006, income
      from
      securities transactions of $2,858,000 was 159% above last fiscal year s third
      quarter income (see last paragraph). Shareholders  equity of $57,683,000 at
      January 31, 2006 was 36% higher than shareholders  equity of $42,541,000 at
      January 31, 2005.    

Subscription
      revenues of $35,963,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 were 4%
      below
      revenues for the comparable period of the prior fiscal year. Electronic
      publications revenues of $8,240,000 were up $168,000 or 2% compared to
      $8,072,000 for the prior fiscal year. Within electronic publications revenues
      are revenues generated by institutional subscribers and retail subscribers.
      Institutional revenues increased $698,000 or 35%, while revenues from retail
      subscribers were down $530,000 or 9%. Print subscription revenues of $27,723,000
      were down $1,761,000 or 6% compared to $29,484,000 for the last fiscal year.
      Subscription revenues of $11,890,000 for the three months ended January 31,
      2006
      were 5% below revenues for the comparable period of the prior fiscal year.
      Electronic publications revenues of $2,697,000 were down $55,000 or 2% compared
      to $2,752,000 for the prior fiscal year. Institutional electronic publications
      revenues increased $26,000 or 3%, while revenues from retail electronic
      publication subscribers were down $81,000 or 4%. Print subscription revenues
      of
      $9,193,000 were down $580,000 or 6% compared to $9,773,000 for the last fiscal
      year.

Licensing
      fees for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 of $3,335,000 were up $1,619,000
      or 94% compared to $1,716,000 for the same period of fiscal 2005. Licensing
      fees
      for the third quarter ended January 31, 2006 of $1,442,000 increased $794,000
      or
      123% from the comparable period of last fiscal year.    

Investment
      management fees and service revenues of $24,160,000 for the nine months ended
      January 31, 2006 were up $72,000, which is less than 1% above the prior fiscal
      year s revenues of $24,088,000. Beginning November 2004, Value Line Securities,
      Inc. suspended its business of effecting trades for any of the Value Line Funds,
      from which it had earned net commission revenues. The decline in brokerage
      revenues was mostly offset by higher investment advisory fees that resulted
      primarily from a 10% increase in the net assets of the Value Line family of
      mutual funds, which includes fee waivers for certain of the Value Line Mutual
      Funds. Total mutual funds net assets as of January 31, 2006 were
      $3,604,391,000. 

Operating
      expenses for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 of $37,788,000 were 16%
      below expenses of $44,810,000 for the comparable period of the previous fiscal
      year. Operating expenses for the third quarter ended January 31, 2006 of
      $13,545,000 were 7% below expenses of $14,621,000 for the same period last
      fiscal year. Total advertising and promotional expenses of $9,902,000 for the
      nine months ended January 31, 2006 were 39% below the prior year s expenses of
      $16,245,000. Advertising and promotional expenses for the third quarter ended
      January 31, 2006 of $3,826,000 were 30% below expenses of $5,455,000 for the
      prior year. The decrease in advertising expenses resulted primarily from the
      reduction in the frequency of marketing campaigns in fiscal 2006 for the
      Company s investment periodicals. Salaries and employee benefit expenses of
      $14,605,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 were 5% below expenses of
      $15,337,000 for the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of staff
      consolidations in the Company. Production and distribution expenses for the
      nine
      months ended January 31, 2006 of $5,314,000 were 20% below expenses of
      $6,615,000 for the same period of fiscal 2005. Production and distribution
      expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 of $1,712,000 were 19% below
      fiscal 2005 expenses. The decline in expenses for the nine months and third
      quarter were primarily due to lower paper, printing and distribution costs
      that
      resulted in part from a decrease in circulation of the print products and the
      elimination of brokerage execution fees. Office and administrative expenses
      for
      the first nine months of fiscal 2006 of $7,967,000 were 20% higher than the
      prior fiscal year s expenses of $6,613,000 and expenses of $3,260,000 for the
      third quarter of fiscal 2006 were 45% higher than the last fiscal year s
      expenses. The increase in administrative expenses was primarily due to an
      increase in professional fees and the additional costs associated with
      outsourcing certain of the mutual fund administration functions.  

For
      the
      nine months ended January 31, 2006, the Company s income from securities
      transactions, net, of $3,571,000 was 56% below securities transactions income
      of
      $8,033,000 for the same period of the last fiscal year. Income from securities
      transactions, net, for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 included dividend
      and interest income of $1,315,000. Capital gains during the first nine months
      of
      fiscal 2006 were $2,310,000, of which $2,355,000 represented distributions
      during the quarter ended January 31, 2006 from the Value Line Mutual Funds
      and
      $75,000 from an installment sale of an investment in a privately held Company.
      The income from securities transactions for the first nine months of fiscal
      2006
      compares to dividend and interest income of $360,000 and capital gains of
      $6,750,000 from sales of securities included in the Company s trading and
      available for sale portfolios included in the nine months ended January 31,
      2005. The first nine months of the prior fiscal year included capital gains
      that
      resulted from partial sales of the Company s equity securities in preparation
      for payment on May 19, 2004 of a special dividend of $17.50 per share to all
      common shareholders of record as of May 7, 2004 and redeployment of the
      remaining proceeds in fixed income government obligations. Capital gains for
      the
      nine months of fiscal 2005 also included $433,000 from the initial proceeds
      from
      an installment sale of an investment in a privately held Company.

For
      the
      third quarter ended January 31, 2006, the Company s income from securities
      transactions, net, was $2,858,000, 159% above securities transactions income
      of
      $1,104,000 for the same period of the last fiscal year. Income from securities
      transactions, net, for the three months ended January 31, 2006 included dividend
      and interest income of $587,000 and capital gains of $2,271,000 of which
      $2,355,000 represented capital gain distributions from the Value Line Mutual
      Funds. This compares to dividend and interest income of $186,000 and capital
      gains of $918,000 from sales of securities included in the Company s trading and
      available for sale portfolios, the proceeds of which were reinvested in fixed
      income government obligations during the three months ended January 31, 2005.

      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Market
      Risk Disclosures  

Value
      Line, Inc. s Consolidated Balance Sheet includes a substantial amount of assets
      and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Value Line s
      significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates and equity
      prices. The following sections address the significant market risks associated
      with Value Line s business activities. 

Interest
      Rate Risk  

Value
      Line concentrates its fixed income investments in highly liquid debt securities
      with extremely low credit risk. Value Line s strategy is to acquire securities
      that are attractively priced in relation to the perceived credit risk.
      Management recognizes and accepts that losses may occur. To limit the price
      fluctuation in these securities from interest rate changes, Value Line s
      management invests primarily in short-term obligations maturing in 1 to 5
      years. 

The
      fair
      values of Value Line s fixed maturity investments will fluctuate in response to
      changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in prevailing interest
      rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those
      instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments
      may be affected by prepayment options, relative values of alternative
      investments, and other general market conditions. 

16 

The
      following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases
      and
      decreases in interest rates on assets that are subject to interest rate risk.
      It
      is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category
      of
      instrument containing interest rate risks. The hypothetical changes in market
      interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios.
      Variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the
      timing of repayments due to prepayment options available. For these reasons,
      actual results might differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are
      in
      thousands. 

Equity
      Price Risk   

The
      carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted
      market prices or management s estimates of fair value as of the balance sheet
      dates. Market prices are subject to fluctuation and, consequently, the amount
      realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from
      the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may
      result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of
      the
      issuer, the relative price of alternative investments and general market
      conditions. Furthermore, amounts realized in the sale of a particular security
      may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being
      sold. 

Value
      Line invests a significant level of its assets in equity securities, primarily
      the Value Line family of equity mutual funds. Each mutual fund invests in a
      variety of equity positions of various companies thereby diversifying Value
      Line s risk. Value Line has also utilized derivative financial instruments in
      the past to minimize market price risk, although no such derivative financial
      instruments were utilized during fiscal years 2006 and 2005. 

The
      table
      below summarizes Value Line s equity price risks as of January 31, 2006 and
      April 30, 2005 and shows the effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30%
      decrease in market prices as of those dates. The selected hypothetical changes
      do not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios.
      Dollars are in thousands.

      Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

(a)  
             
                The
                registrant s principal executive officer and principal financial officer
                have concluded that the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures
                (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a - 15(e)), based on their evaluation
                of these controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered
                by
                this report, are appropriately designed to ensure that material
                information relating to the registrant is made known to such officers
                and
                are operating effectively. 

(b)  
             
                The
                registrant s principal executive officer and principal financial officer
                have determined that there have been no changes in the registrant s
                internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
                registrant s last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is
                reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control
                over financial reporting.
