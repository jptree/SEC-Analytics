                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                   SEPTEMBER 30, 1996
                                     (unaudited)

(1)  BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     The accompanying financial statements present the consolidated accounts of
Mobley Environmental Services, Inc. (the "Company") and its subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

     The unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments
which are, in the opinion of management, of a normal and recurring nature and
necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial position of the
Company as of September 30, 1996, and the consolidated results of operations and
cash flows for the periods presented herein. Interim results are not necessarily
indicative of results for a full year. The unaudited consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto presented in the Company's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 1995.

     Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions
relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent liabilities to prepare these financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

(2)  PENDING ASSET SALES AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

     Due to the Company's inability to secure, on acceptable terms, the capital
resources necessary to continue the implementation of its strategic plans to
expand its hydrocarbon recycling business, and after considering the attendant
risks of continuing to pursue such strategy in light of its severely strained
liquidity, in September 1996, the Company's Board of Directors determined that
the divestiture of its operations was in the best interests of the Company and
its shareholders.  Subsequently, on October 30, 1996 and November 1, 1996, the
Company executed letters of intent to sell substantially all of its operating
assets in two separate transactions.  The proposed transactions and their impact
on the Company's consolidated financial statements are described in the
following paragraphs.

     SALE OF WASTE MANAGEMENT SERVICES ASSETS & DISCONTINUANCE OF BUSINESS
SEGMENT.  On October 30, 1996, the Company signed a letter of intent with United
States Filter Corporation ("USF") to sell substantially all of the assets
related to its waste management services activities.  Under the terms of the
letter of intent, the Company will receive $8.0 million in shares of USF common
stock (registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission) in exchange for
such assets, and can earn up to an additional $4.0 million in USF common stock
based on the performance of the business during the two years following its
sale, currently anticipated to be completed by March 31, 1997.  Additionally,
USF will assume certain liabilities (accounts payable and accrued expenses) as
part of the transaction.  The letter of intent further specifies that the sales
price of the assets will be adjusted upward or downward based on the level of
net assets, as defined, at the time of closing.  Completion of the transaction
is subject to final negotiation and signing of a definitive acquisition
agreement, which is expected to contain standard conditions to closing,
including board and shareholder approval and due diligence, and the distribution
of an Information Statement describing the proposed transaction to the Company's
shareholders.  The net assets which are the subject of the letter of intent are
shown in the accompanying September 30, 1996 consolidated balance sheet as "net
assets available for sale" at their estimated net realizable value as determined
by the aforementioned terms, less anticipated transaction costs of approximately
$450,000.  Such assets had a net book value at September 30, 1996 (net of
assumed liabilities) of approximately $14,965,000.  As a result of the pending
sale, the Company recorded a charge of $7,621,000 (net of a deferred income tax
benefit of $698,000) during the three-month and nine-month periods ended
September 30, 1996, representing the estimated loss on the disposal of the
business segment, including certain required capital expenditures prior to the
sale amounting to approximately $900,000.  In determining the estimated loss on
disposal, only the $8.0 million guaranteed portion of the sales price was
considered (i.e., that portion which is contingent on the future performance of
the business was ignored).  The Company estimates that it will incur additional
operating losses in this business segment, after the allocation of certain
overhead and interest costs, amounting to approximately $331,000 during the
phase-out period from October 1, 1996 to March 31, 1997.  A provision for such
estimated net losses has been made in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended
September 30, 1996.

SALE OF OILFIELD SERVICES ASSETS AND DISCONTINUANCE OF BUSINESS SEGMENT. 
On November 1, 1996, the Company signed a letter of intent with Dawson
Production Services, Inc. ("Dawson") to sell substantially all of the assets
related to its oilfield services business.  Under the terms of the letter of
intent, the Company will receive $5,000,000 and a subordinated note in the
amount of $500,000, due two years after the closing date, in exchange for such
assets.  Completion of the sale, expected in January 1997, is subject to final
negotiation and signing of a definitive acquisition agreement, which is expected
to contain standard conditions to closing, including board approval and due
diligence.  The assets which are the subject of the letter of intent have a net
book value, based on historical cost adjusted for accumulated depreciation and
amortization, of approximately $2,494,000, and are shown in the accompanying
September 30, 1996 consolidated balance sheet as "net assets available for sale"
at that carrying amount.  The results of operations associated with the
discontinued segment through the anticipated disposal date, after allocation of
certain overhead and interest costs, are not expected to result in a loss and
consequently, no additional losses have been reflected in the accompanying
statements of operations for the three months and nine months ended September
30, 1996.  The Company expects to record a gain upon completion of the sale,
after estimated transaction costs of $250,000, amounting to approximately
$2,750,000.

     In anticipation of the planned divestitures and after consideration of the
Company's ongoing operational needs, the Company recorded certain restructuring
charges during the 1996 third quarter.  Such charges, totaling $650,000,
included employee severance obligations, costs associated with the relocation
and recruitment of personnel, and other related expenses.

     The Company's two business segments, waste management services and oilfield
services, have been accounted for as discontinued operations, and accordingly,
their operations have been segregated in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations.  The revenues, operating costs and expenses, other
income and expense, and income taxes for the three-month and nine-month periods
ended September 30, 1996 and 1995, have been reclassified for amounts associated
with the discontinued segments.  General and administrative expenses allocated
to continuing operations have been estimated based upon anticipated ongoing
costs following completion of the proposed asset divestitures.  In light of the
pending asset divestitures and related business reorganization, management has
elected to allocate selling, general, and administrative expenses, other income
and expense and restructuring expenses between the discontinued business
segments based on the ratio of segment revenues to total revenues.  Such
allocation method differs from that used in presenting certain information about
the Company's business segments in its annual report on Form 10-K for the years
ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993. Income taxes have been allocated based
on the effective tax rate.

     Operating results and the estimated loss on disposal of the Company's waste
management services segment for the three-month and nine-month periods ended
September 30, 1996 and 1995 are as follows (in thousands of dollars):

(3)  NOTES PAYABLE

     The Company has a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") dated 
June 2, 1995 with Bank One, Texas, N.A. (the "Bank") that provides up to 
$6,500,000 in available credit for the Company through June 1997. Under the 
terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company may borrow, subject to a defined 
borrowing base, up to $4,000,000 under a revolving line of credit (including 
up to $1,800,000 in letters of credit) for working capital and general 
corporate purposes, and up to $2,500,000 under a term loan facility for 
purposes of acquiring certain eligible equipment.

     At September 30, 1996, the Company had borrowed the full $2,500,000 
available under the term loan portion of the Credit Agreement, consisting of 
two notes in the original amounts of $700,000 (payable quarterly over five 
years) and $1,800,000 (payable quarterly over seven years). Both notes bear 
interest at 8.25%.  The outstanding balance of these notes at September 30, 
1996 was $2,356,000.

     At September 30, 1996, $2,550,000 was outstanding under the revolving 
credit agreement and $1,448,000 in letters of credit had been issued under 
such line of credit. Such amount has a maturity date of June 2, 1997 and 
bears interest, payable quarterly, at the Bank's prime rate (8.25% at 
September 30, 1996).

     The Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants which include the
maintenance of minimum tangible net worth, as defined, and certain financial
ratios. The Company has not been in compliance with certain covenant
requirements since June 30, 1996, placing it in technical default. Consequently,
the Company has classified the entire outstanding balance as a current
liability.

(4)  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     LETTERS OF CREDIT. At September 30, 1996, a letter of credit in the 
amount of $1,281,000 had been provided by the Company to its insurance carrier 
in connection with its workers' compensation, general liability and auto 
liability insurance policies. Additionally, the Company has provided a letter 
of credit to the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission ("TNRCC") in 
the amount of $167,000 to secure the payment of fines assessed Gibraltar 
Chemical Resources, Inc. ("Gibraltar"), the Company's former subsidiary, by 
the TNRCC in connection with the December 1994 settlement of certain 
litigation.

     LITIGATION AND VARIOUS OTHER CLAIMS. The Company continues to defend 
various claims resulting from the operations of its former subsidiary, 
Gibraltar, which was sold effective December 31, 1994. As of December 23, 
1996, six such lawsuits were pending, one of which is asserted as a class 
action. Certain of the claimants seek compensatory and punitive damages for 
alleged personal injury and property damage caused by operations and 
emissions of Gibraltar's hazardous waste disposal facility. Additionally, one 
claimant seeks permanent closure of the facility and civil penalties as the 
remedy for alleged violations by Gibraltar of environmental protection 
statutes and endangerment to public health and the environment.

     These matters raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues, 
including but not limited to, the nature and amount of the Company's 
liability, if any. Although the Company is a defendant in some litigation, in 
other matters the Company's potential liability arises from material contractual
indemnifications given by the Company to the purchaser of Gibraltar. These 
indemnifications may include the potential liability of former customers of 
Gibraltar, approximately 50 of which have also become defendants in litigation 
involving Gibraltar's operations. Accordingly, the Company is not able to 
estimate the nature and precise amount of future liabilities with respect to 
such matters.

     The Company, based on consultation with its legal counsel, believes that 
its liability insurance coverage, combined with presently established accruals,
adequately address its potential exposure for the foregoing matters. However, 
the Company has been notified by its insurance carrier that it disputes the 
Company's interpretation of its pollution liability insurance coverage and 
policy limitations applicable to the foregoing claims. While the Company is 
vigorously pursuing a favorable resolution of this dispute through a 
declaratory judgment action against its insurance carrier, it is unable to 
determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome at this time.

     The Company's contractual indemnity obligations to the purchaser of 
Gibraltar also encompass various pending regulatory and permit renewal 
proceedings. The failure of Gibraltar to prevail in these matters could 
result in significant liabilities to the Company. In addition to the 
foregoing matters, the Company is obligated to indemnify the purchaser of 

11

Gibraltar for breaches of representations and warranties made by the Company 
to such purchaser and for future claims against Gibraltar arising from 
circumstances existing on or prior to the date of the sale of Gibraltar.

     The Company's obligations to indemnify the purchaser of Gibraltar for 
claims other than tax, environmental, and ERISA claims expired June 30, 1996. 
However, the Company remains obligated to indemnify the purchaser for tax, 
environmental, and ERISA claims, including those discussed above. As the 
nature and scope of the Company's ultimate liability arising from Gibraltar's 
operations and its sale become better defined, there will be changes in 
estimates of the future costs relating thereto which could have a material 
adverse effect on the Company's future financial condition, results of 
operations, or liquidity.

     The Company has been named as a potentially responsible party with respect
to a State of Texas superfund site. The Company has recorded an accrual for 
its estimated exposure in connection with this matter, the amount of which is 
not material to the consolidated financial statements.

     There are various other claims and legal actions pending and threatened
against the Company which have arisen in the ordinary course of its business.
Where applicable, the Company has recorded accruals for estimated potential
damages and expenses associated with such matters. While the final outcome of
these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management, upon consultation
with legal counsel and considering existing insurance coverage, believes that
any financial obligations of the Company arising from such claims would not be
material to its consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS

GENERAL

     The Company's business involves providing diverse environmental and field-
related services to industrial, governmental, and commercial markets,
specializing in the collection, transportation, treatment, recycling and
management of a wide variety of non-hazardous liquid hydrocarbons, oil filters,
absorbents and related materials.  Additionally, through its oilfield services
segment, the Company provides services for managing liquids used or produced
during the lifecycle of oil and gas wells.

     The following discussion is designed to assist in the understanding of the
Company's financial condition as of September 30, 1996, as well as the Company's
operating results for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30,
1996.  Certain material events affecting the business of the Company are
discussed in Item 1 of this report.  The Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements contained detailed information that should be read in conjunction
with this discussion.

PENDING ASSET SALES, DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

     Due to the Company's inability to secure, on acceptable terms, the capital
resources necessary to continue the implementation of its strategic plans to
expand its hydrocarbon recycling business, and after considering the attendant
risks of continuing to pursue such strategy in light of its severely strained
liquidity, in September 1996, the Company's Board of Directors determined that
the divestiture of its operations was in the best interests of the Company and
its shareholders.  Subsequently, on October 30, 1996 and November 1, 1996, the
Company executed letters of intent to sell substantially  all of its operating
assets in two separate transactions.  Because of the pending sales, results of
operations of the Company's two business segments have been accounted for as
discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
The proposed transactions and their impact on the Company's consolidated
financial statements are described in the following paragraphs.

     SALE OF WASTE MANAGEMENT SERVICES ASSETS & DISCONTINUANCE OF BUSINESS
SEGMENT.  On October 30, 1996, the Company signed a letter of intent with United
States Filter Corporation ("USF") to sell substantially all of the assets
related to its waste management services activities.  Under the terms of the
letter of intent, the Company will receive $8.0 million in shares of USF common
stock (registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission) in exchange for
such assets, and can earn up to an additional $4.0 million in USF common stock
based on the performance of the business during the two years following its
sale, currently anticipated to be completed by March 31, 1997.  Additionally,
USF will assume certain liabilities (accounts payable and accrued expenses) as
part of the transaction.  The letter of intent further specifies that the sales
price of the assets will be adjusted upward or downward based on the level of
net assets, as defined, at the time of 

12

closing.  Completion of the transaction is subject to final negotiation and 
signing of a definitive acquisition agreement, which is expected to contain 
standard conditions to closing, including board and shareholder approval and 
due diligence, and the distribution of an Information Statement describing 
the proposed transaction to the Company's shareholders.  The net assets which 
are the subject of the letter of intent are shown in the accompanying 
September 30, 1996 consolidated balance sheet as "net assets available for 
sale" at their estimated net realizable value as determined by the 
aforementioned terms, less anticipated transaction costs of approximately 
$450,000.  Such assets had a net book value at September 30, 1996 (net of 
assumed liabilities) of approximately $14,965,000.  As a result of the 
pending sale, the Company recorded a charge of $7,621,000 (net of a deferred 
income tax benefit of $698,000) during the three-month and nine-month periods 
ended September 30, 1996, representing the estimated loss on the disposal of 
the business segment, including certain required capital expenditures prior 
to the sale.  In determining the estimated loss on disposal, only the $8.0 
million guaranteed portion of the sales price was considered (i.e., that 
portion which is contingent on the future performance of the business was 
ignored).  The Company estimates that it will incur additional operating 
losses in this business segment, after the allocation of certain overhead and 
interest costs, amounting to approximately $331,000 during the phase-out 
period from October 1, 1996 to March 31, 1997.  A provision for such 
estimated net losses has been made in the accompanying consolidated 
statements of operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended 
September 30, 1996.

     SALE OF OILFIELD SERVICES ASSETS AND DISCONTINUANCE OF BUSINESS SEGMENT. 
On November 1, 1996, the Company signed a letter of intent with Dawson 
Production Services, Inc. ("Dawson") to sell substantially all of the assets 
related to its oilfield services business.  Under the terms of the letter of 
intent, the Company will receive $5,000,000 and a subordinated note in the 
amount of $500,000, due two years after the closing date, in exchange for 
such assets. Completion of the sale, expected in January 1997, is subject to 
final negotiation and signing of a definitive acquisition agreement, which is 
expected to contain standard conditions to closing, including board approval 
and due diligence.  The assets which are the subject of the letter of intent 
have a net book value, based on historical cost adjusted for accumulated 
depreciation and amortization, of approximately $2,494,000, and are shown in 
the accompanying September 30, 1996 consolidated balance sheet as "net assets 
available for sale" at that carrying amount.  The results of operations 
associated with the discontinued segment through the anticipated disposal 
date, after allocation of certain overhead and interest costs, are not 
expected to be material and consequently, such amounts have not been 
reflected in the accompanying statements of operations for the three months 
and nine months ended September 30, 1996.  The Company expects to record a 
gain upon completion of the sale, after estimated transaction costs of 
$250,000, amounting to approximately $2,750,000.

     In light of the planned divestitures and after consideration of its ongoing
operational needs, the Company recorded certain restructuring charges during the
1996 third quarter.  Such charges, totaling $650,000, included employee
severance obligations, costs associated with the relocation and recruitment of
personnel, and other related expenses.  

     The net effect of the proposed transactions and related charges described 
in the preceding paragraphs on the results of operations for the three-month 
and nine-month periods ended September 30, 1996 approximated $8.6 million, 
and is summarized as follows (in thousands of dollars):

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 1996 amounted to 
$5,751,000, compared to $4,904,000 in the comparable period of 1995, an increase
of 17.3%.  On a segment basis, revenues from waste management services increased
24.1% during the 1996 three-month period, primarily the result of the continued
growth of its used oil and filter recycling business lines, which commenced
operations during the 1995 third quarter.  Revenues in the oilfield services
segment of the Company's business declined nominally in the 1996 third quarter
compared to the same period a year ago.  During the nine months ended September
30, 1996, total revenues amounted to $14,928,000, compared to $13,873,000 in the
corresponding 1995 period, an increase of 7.6%.  During this same period, waste
management services revenues increased 10.8%, while revenues from oilfield
services remained relatively flat.  The net increase in waste management
services revenue in the year-to-date period was largely impacted by  the
aforementioned start-up of two new business lines, partly offset by a decline in
revenues from hydrocarbon/water separations services caused by a severe regional
drought which greatly diminished fluid volumes during the first half of 1996.

     Gross profit for the quarter ended September 30, 1996 amounted to 
$1,221,000 compared to $1,630,000 in the same 1995 period.  The gross profit 
margin in the waste management services segment amounted to roughly 19.2% in 
the 1996 third quarter, compared to 33.5% in 1995.  Similarly, on a 
year-to-date basis, gross profit for the 1996 nine-month period totaled 
$3,227,000, versus $4,720,000 in the corresponding period of 1995.  Waste 
management services gross profit as a percentage of segment revenue fell to 
20.6% from 33.6% in the year-ago period. The marked decline in margin was 
primarily attributable to unusually high costs associated with various 
operational issues surrounding the recently  constructed used oil and filter 
recycling facilities and, to a lesser extent, reduced profitability in the 
hydrocarbon/water separations business as a result of the volume shortfall 
referred to in the preceding paragraph.  During the quarter ended September 
30, 1996, the gross profit margin from oilfield services activities fell 
slightly from that of the 1995 quarter, while on a year-to-date basis, such 
decline was more pronounced.  Gross profit margins in this segment were 
negatively impacted by an unfavorable business mix and increased operating 
costs during the first half of 1996.

     Comparatively higher selling, general and administrative expenses during 
the 1996 quarter and year-to-date periods were primarily the result of 
incremental overhead costs associated with the start-up and development of 
the aforementioned new business lines.

     In connection with the pending sales discussed previously, the Company
recorded a deferred income tax benefit of $698,000 during the three-month and
nine-month periods ended September 30, 1996, representing a reduction in
deferred income tax liabilities.  No other income tax expense or benefit was
recognized during these periods.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

     The substantial losses sustained by the Company, coupled with the 
significant capital requirements necessary  to support its expansion 
strategy, have severely weakened the Company's liquidity, substantially 
consuming its cash resources and exhausting its borrowing capacity.  Capital 
spending during the 1996 nine-month period amounted to approximately $4.8 
million, primarily relating to the construction of two new processing facilities
as part of the continued development of the Company's used oil and filter 
recycling business lines.  Such expenditures were funded largely through bank 
borrowings.  At September 30, 1996, outstanding bank indebtedness totaled 
$4.9 million and no additional borrowings were available under the Company's 
existing bank credit facilities. The Company has been in violation of certain 
covenant requirements of its bank credit agreement since June 30, 1996, 
placing it in technical default.  The Company plans to retire the outstanding 
indebtedness with the proceeds from the asset sales discussed previously.

     Presently, it is contemplated that all or substantially all of the $8.0
million in USF common stock received at the time of the closing of the sale of
its waste management services assets will be immediately sold.  Cash from the
USF stock sale, along with the proceeds from the sale of the oilfield services
assets, are expected to result in net proceeds totaling approximately $7.4
million after repayment of the outstanding bank indebtedness and transaction
expenses.  Such net proceeds will be used to fund the current liabilities
retained by the Company following the sales, with the remaining surplus cash
expected to initially be deployed in short-term investments. The Company
anticipates that ongoing general and administrative expenses will be reduced to
approximately $300,000 annually upon completion of the sale, and expects
earnings from investments to largely offset such costs.  The amounts described
herein are approximate and based on the Company's current estimates. 
Furthermore, there can be no assurance that such amounts will actually be
realized.

14

In addition to the aforementioned proceeds, under the terms of the 
letters of intent for the proposed asset sales, the Company may receive up to 
$4.0 million in USF common stock during the two-year period following the 
sale based on the performance of the hydrocarbon recycling business and will 
receive a $500,000 subordinated note receivable from Dawson related to the 
sale of the oilfield services assets with a maturity two years following the 
closing date.

     Because of its indemnification obligations related to the sale of 
Gibraltar, as well as potential indemnity  obligations with respect to the 
asset sales to USF and Dawson, and in light of the ongoing litigation 
(described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 
December 31, 1995 and subsequent 1996 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q), the 
Company, based on consultation with legal counsel, does not currently 
anticipate making a distribution to stockholders in the foreseeable future. 
While the Company may investigate new business opportunities that arise, the 
nature and probability of any investments which might result from such 
investigations cannot be determined.

     In the event that either or both of the sales transactions described 
previously are not consummated, the Company's Board of Directors may seek to 
sell some or all of the Company's assets to another purchaser or purchasers. 
The Company's inability to consummate the contemplated sales as planned in a 
timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the Company's 
consolidated financial position and liquidity.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     Except as set forth in the following paragraph, there have been no 
material developments in the legal proceedings described in the Company's 
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1995 and its 
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31 and June 30, 
1996.

     In a suit filed against the Company in August, 1992 styled MONCRIEF V. 
GIBRALTAR CHEMICAL RESOURCES, INC. in State District Court in Smith County, 
Texas, plaintiffs owning property in the vicinity of Gibraltar's hazardous 
waste facility in Winona, Texas asserted that the value of their land had 
been diminished as a result of the alleged emission of objectionable odors 
from Gibraltar's facility.  The Company defended the claim in a jury trial 
which resulted in inconsequential damages being awarded to the plaintiffs on 
November 7, 1996.  However, the verdict is subject to appeal in accordance 
with applicable rules of civil procedure.

ITEM 2.  CHANGES IN SECURITIES

     None.

ITEM 3.  DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES

     As discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and 
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations--Capital Resources and Liquidity," the Company has not been in 
compliance with certain restrictive covenants required under the terms of its 
bank credit agreement since June 30, 1996, placing it in technical default. 
The Company is not in default on its scheduled payments of principal and 
interest with respect to its outstanding bank indebtedness.
