                                   (Unaudited)

     The accompanying financial statements of the Company have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form
10-Q. Certain notes and other information have been condensed or omitted from
the interim financial statements presented in this report. Accordingly, they do
not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete
financial statements. In the opinion of management, the financial statements
reflect all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation. The
results of operations for the three months ended January 31, 2006 and January
31, 2005 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the
full year. For further information, refer to the financial statements and
footnotes thereto included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the
year ended October 31, 2005 as filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

     Note 1: Organization

     Rocky Mountain Minerals, Inc (variously the "Company", the "Registrant" and
"RMMI") was incorporated in Wyoming on May 19, 1978 and is considered to be a
mining company in the exploratory stage and a development stage company as
defined by SFAS No. 7, and since inception, has been engaged in the assessment
of resource exploration properties.

     Note 2: Income Taxes

     No provision for income taxes is required for the period ended January 31,
2006 or 2005, because (a) in management's opinion, the current year will result
in a net operating loss, (b) there are no previous earnings to which the current
year's estimated loss may be carried back, and (c) there are no recorded income
tax deferrals to be eliminated.

     Note 3: Loss per Share/Common Stock

     Loss per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding during the three months ended January 31, 2005 and 2006,
100,701,039 shares in 2005 and 97,494,648 shares in 2006. The weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period from inception
through January 31, 2006 is 65,339,698. .

     Note 4: Investment in Joint Venture

     In July 2004, the Company entered into an agreement with Octanex NL and
Strata

                                       (5)

Resources NL whereby an aggregate of 10 million shares of Common stock in RMMI,
previously issued by RMMI to Octanex and Strata, was reconveyed to RMMI during
the second quarter 2005. As consideration for the reconveyance, RMMI's 25% share
of the initial net cash proceeds of the BHP Permit Sale Transaction, up to a
limit of (US)$150,000, were offset against seismic acquisition obligations of
RMMI to Octanex/Strata pursuant to the Farmin Agreement. (See Item 2 - Oil & Gas
Exploration Activities).

     Note 5: Related Party Transactions

     Mr. E Geoffrey Albers is a director and shareholder of Great Missenden

18 months on the basis of 5,000 shares of Common Stock for every $1,000. The
Company has the right to repay in full at any time during the first 18 months.

     With regard to the interest in the Exmouth Joint Venture, Mr E Geoffrey
Albers is a director and shareholder in each of Octanex NL and Strata Resources
NL. All of these companies, with RMMI, are the holders of the Exmouth Joint
Venture.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

Critical Accounting Policies

     The Company has identified the accounting policies described below as
critical to its business operations and the understanding of the Company's
results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these
policies on the Company's business operations is discussed throughout this
section where such policies affect the Company's reported and expected financial
results. The preparation of this Quarterly Report requires the Company to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and
liabilities of the Company, revenues and expenses of the Company during the
reporting period and contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the
Company's financial statements. There can be no assurance that the actual
results will not differ from those estimates.

Undeveloped mineral interests and oil and gas properties:

     The Company utilized the "successful efforts" method of accounting for
undeveloped mineral interests and oil and gas properties. Capitalized costs were
charged to operations at the time the

(6)

Company determined that no economic reserves existed. Costs of carrying and
retaining undeveloped properties were charged to expense when incurred. Proceeds
from the sale of undeveloped properties were treated as a recovery of cost.
Proceeds in excess of the capitalized cost realized in the sale of any such
properties, if any, were to be recognized as gain to the extent of the excess.

Impairment of long-lived assets:

     The Company evaluates the potential impairment of long-lived assets in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. The Company quarterly
reviews the amount of recorded long-lived assets for impairment. If the carrying
amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash
flows, the Company will recognize an impairment loss in such period.

Investment in Joint Venture

     The Company's investment in the Exmouth Joint Venture reflects its 25%
residual interest in two petroleum exploration permits, offshore Western
Australia following the transactions previously referred to with BHP Billiton
and Apache, including the deferred consideration and the royalty interest. The
capitalized cost reflects the issue of preferred and common stock at the market
price at the date of stock issuance. In addition, the Company recorded an
estimate of $40,000 for the costs to register the restricted stock.

Results of Operations

Background

     The Company began operations on May 19, 1978 and is considered to be a
mining and oil and gas royalty company in the exploratory stage and has had no
significant revenues. In 1984 the Company ceased gold extraction operations at
its Rochester, Montana mining property. During 1988, with the receipt of funding
from a stock purchase agreement, it resumed mineral exploration both at
Rochester and elsewhere in North America and Australia. Despite detailed
geologic investigations by the Company and by leading gold exploration
companies, there was insufficient encouragement from results to warrant further
investigations or activities at Rochester. In 2002 and 2003 the Registrant sold
thirteen patented mining claims in the Rochester Mining district for $82,192 and
is pursuing the sale of the additional eighteen mining claims in the district.
The Registrant anticipates receiving approximately $150,000 from the remaining
property and recorded an impairment loss in the carrying amount of Assets held
for sale of $268,000 during the third quarter of 2003.

     General and administrative expenses decreased for the three months ending
January 31, 2006 as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2005
primarily due to the Company's decreased level of activity in evaluating various
business opportunities during 2006 and lower compensation during the period.

The Company plans to seek out further oil and gas exploration and
production properties in the Rocky Mountain region of the U.S. and also in
Australia. The Company has a representative office in Melbourne, Australia and
Prescott, Arizona.

(7)

Plan of Operation

General

     The Registrant is focused on exploration and development of oil and natural
gas resources. Our core business is directed at the acquisition of interests in
oil and gas prospects in the offshore areas of Australia's territorial waters.
We rely on the considerable experience in the oil and gas industry of our
directors and our consultants to identify and conduct initial analyses of
properties in which we may acquire an interest. We devote essentially all of our
resources to the identification of high quality oil and gas properties and seek
to keep our overheads at a minimum level through the retention of carefully
selected consultants, contractors and service companies. We use proven
technologies to evaluate prospects before acquiring a working interest.
Generally, we expect to invest in projects at different levels of participation.
We plan to maintain as high a percentage of participation as can be prudently
managed. We will focus on areas considered to have significant near term
potential for oil or medium term potential for gas, or which can be farmed out
and/or developed in conjunction with other industry players. We intend to
consistently minimize our financial outlay requirements, wherever possible,
through promoted farm-out transactions to provide maximum leverage for
shareholders at minimal cost.

Oil and Gas Exploration Activities

     In April 2003 the Registrant by way of a Farmin Agreement ("Farmin
Agreement") subsequently approved by the Western Australian Offshore Petroleum
Authority (the "Designated Authority") acquired a 25% interest in the Exmouth
Joint Venture which held two petroleum exploration permits, WA-322-P and
WA-329-P, granted and authorized by the Australian government in the North West
Shelf area of the Carnarvon Basin, offshore Western Australia, from two
Australian public companies. Mr. E.G. Albers, a member of the Registrant's
board, is also a shareholder and director of these companies. The area
represented by the permits is approximately 356,000 acres, and the project is
known as the Exmouth Joint Venture. In agreeing to earn a 25% interest in the
project, the Registrant issued 15,000,000 shares of Restricted Common Stock and
19,091,550 shares of Restricted $0.015 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock to
meet a $969,550 funding requirement associated with the interest. The initial
exploration program has
consisted of acquiring and interpreting existing open-file seismic data
including 2D and 3D seismic data sets, and the planned shooting of new seismic
surveying.

     In early 2004 the Exmouth Joint Venturers entered into and subsequently
settled an agreement with a subsidiary of BHP Billiton Petroleum Limited ("BHP")
for the sale of Exploration Permit WA-322-P to BHP . In return BHP agreed to the
acquisition and processing of 3D seismic in the Joint Venture's adjacent
exploration permit, WA-329-P, as well as a $600,000 initial cash payment, a
deferred cash payment of $1,100,000 contingent upon BHP drilling a well in
WA-322-P and the granting of an overriding royalty interest ranging from 2.75 to
3.75 percent with respect to revenue from any future production from WA-322-P,
less applicable petroleum resource rent tax, depending on the level of aggregate
production.

(8)

The Exmouth Joint Venture has acquired an extensive body of existing
geological data available in relation to WA-329-P and WA-322-P, including a
large amount ofseismic data, together with pertinent existing reports and basic
data collected by previous operators in the area. In addition, BHP agreed to
acquire and process a new seismic on behalf of the Exmouth Joint Venture in
WA-329-P as part of the terms of their acquisition of WA-322-P.

     In July 2004 the Registrant's 25% share of the initial cash proceeds from
the BHP sale, $150,000, were offset against existing year 2 seismic acquisition
obligations pursuant to the Farmin Agreement. As a term of this arrangement the
Registrant entered into an agreement to reacquire 10,000,000 shares of Common
stock in previously issued to Octanex NL and Strata Resources NL, the
Registrant's Joint Venture partners, for no further outlay. The 10,000,000
shares have been reconveyed and the investment in the Joint Venture has been
reduced with a corresponding reduction in Common Stock and capital in excess of
par value. All subsequent seismic commitment costs in WA-329-P were agreed to be
shared pro rate between the Exmouth Joint Venture participants. However, as a
result of the transaction with BHP it is expected that there will be no further
seismic costs to be born by the Exmouth Joint Venture in relation to the year 2
seismic commitment for WA-329-P.

     BHP Billiton is contractually committed to the Exmouth Joint Venturers to
shoot the 55 kms2 of 3D seismic for the benefit of the Exmouth Joint Venture in
WA-329-P. In addition, BHP Billiton has also indicated that they will shoot a
further 80 kms2 in WA-329-P as ingress data which, if shot, will also be made
available to the Exmouth Joint Venture. Costs associated with the shooting of 3D
seismic data are usually in the order of (AUD) $10-12,000 per km2 depending on
size of shoot, weather and other environmental factors. The Exmouth Joint
Venture was informed that BHP had completed 635 square kilometers of 3D seismic
work on Exploration Permit WA-322-P and 107 square kilometers of 3D seismic work
on Exploration Permit WA-329-P in October, 2005.

    On April 18, 2005 the Exmouth Joint Venture entered into a Letter of Offer
from BHP Billiton Petroleum and Apache Northwest, Pty, Ltd. to acquire 100%
interest in Exploration Permit WA-329-P. A finalized Sales and Purchase
Agreement, Royalty Agreement and Transfer of Title was executed July 8, 2005.
The sale consists of the buyers becoming responsible for the terms and
conditions of the Permit, a $400,000 cash payment, which was paid August 9,
2005, a deferred cash payment of $1,000,000 contingent upon the drilling of a
well in WA-329-P, and the grant of an overriding royalty interest ranging from
2.75 to 3.75 percent should there be any future production.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Since ceasing milling operations at its Rochester, Montana property in
1984, the Registrant has evaluated this and other mineral properties, as well as
having pursued waste management activities. The waste management assets have
been sold and the Registrant has its Rochester property on the market for sale
and anticipates receiving approximately $150,000 for the remaining property.

     Management plans to use the funds from the sale of the Rochester property
to fund the Company's evaluation of oil and gas exploration and production
opportunities. Plans for additional funding of these activities include
attempting to obtain external funding, either through the sale of the Company's
common or preferred stock.

Funding

     When the Company requires further funds for its programs, then it is the
Company's intention that the additional funds would be raised in a manner deemed
most expedient by the Board of Directors at the time, taking into account
budgets, share market conditions and the interest of industry in
co-participation in the Company's programs. When additional funds for
exploration are required, it is the Company's plan that they could be raised by
any one or a combination of the following manners: stock placements, pro-rata
issue to stockholders, and/or a further issue of stock to the public. Should
these methods not be considered to be viable, or in the best interests of
stockholders, then it would be the Company's intention to meet its obligations
by either partial sale of the Company's interests or farm out, the latter course
of action being part of the Company's overall strategy. Should funds be required
for appraisal or development purposes the Company would, in addition, look to
project loan finance.

     The Company relies upon certain of its directors to perform the day to day
administrative functions of the Company as well as those actions and decisions
taken by the board of directors. As the Company's capital resources are limited,
the board plans to remunerate certain of its directors by the issue of common
stock in lieu of cash payments. Specifically, during the second quarter 2005,
the Company issued 3,000,000 shares of Common stock to each of Ernest Geoffrey
Albers and to William Ray Hill Jr., for their services in relation to the period
from November 1, 2002 to July 31, 2004 (21 months) and a further 2,000,000
shares have been issued to each of them in the first quarter 2006 for the period
from August 1, 2004 to October 31, 2005 (14 months).

     In addition, the Company has and will accept advances to enable it to meet
its expenditure requirements and in return would issue convertible notes with an
interest coupon of 10% per annum, convertible into shares of Common Stock on the
basis of 5,000 shares of Common stock for every $1,000.00 convertible note or
part thereof.
