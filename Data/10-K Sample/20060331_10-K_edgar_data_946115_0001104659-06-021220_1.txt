Target Credit Card Master
Trust (the  Trust ) was formed pursuant to a Pooling and Servicing Agreement

and Servicing Agreement ), by and among Target National Bank, as servicer (the  Servicer ),
Target Receivables Corporation, as transferor (the  Transferor ), and Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the  Trustee ). The Trust s only
business is to act as a passive conduit to permit investments in a pool of the
Transferor s consumer receivables generated by open-end credit card accounts owned
by the Servicer.  

Target Credit Card Owner
Trust (the  Owner Trust ) was formed as a statutory trust under the laws of the
State of Delaware pursuant to an Amended and Restated Trust Agreement, dated as
of November 4, 2005 (as amended, modified or supplemented, the  Trust Agreement ),
by and between Target Receivables Corporation, as depositor (the  Depositor )
and Wilmington Trust Company, as owner trustee (the  Owner Trustee ). The Owner
Trust s only business is to act as a passive conduit to permit investments in
its assets which are comprised primarily of a collateral certificate
representing an interest in the assets of the Trust.  

Target Receivables
Corporation was formed in Minnesota on May 15, 1995 and is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of a corporation that is wholly-owned by Target Corporation. Target
Receivables Corporation is the Transferor of the receivables to the Trust, the
Depositor of the collateral certificate into the Owner Trust, and the

The assets of the Owner
Trust (the  Owner Trust Assets ) include the collateral certificate,

account.  

The assets of the Trust
(the  Trust Assets ) include a portfolio of receivables (the  Receivables )

accounts (the  Accounts ), funds collected or to be collected in respect of the
Receivables, monies on deposit in certain accounts of the Trust, any
participation interests included in the Trust, funds collected or to be
collected with respect to such participation interests and any enhancement with
respect to a   

3  

particular series or
class. The Trust Assets are expected to change over the life of the Trust as
receivables in consumer open-end credit card accounts and other open-end credit
accounts and related assets are included in the Trust and as Receivables in
Accounts included in the Trust are charged-off or removed.  

Exhibit 99.2 to this Report sets forth certain

information, which was derived from the monthly settlement statements relating
to such period as delivered to the Trustee pursuant to the Pooling and

In July 2002, the Trust

Certificate ) which was transferred to the Owner Trust and the Owner Trust
issued $900,000,000 of five year floating rate Class A Notes to the public (the
 Series 2005-1 Notes ).  

Although they trade in
the over-the-counter market to a limited extent, there is currently no
established public trading market for the Series 2005-1 Notes. The Series 2005-1
Notes are held and delivered in book-entry form through the facilities of The
Depository Trust Company ( DTC ), a  clearing agency  registered pursuant to
the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. The definitive Series 2005-1 Notes are held by Cede   Co., the

Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm  

Target National Bank 
Its Officers and Directors 
As Servicer  

We have examined management s assertion in the accompanying report,
Report of Management on Compliance, dated February 15, 2006, that Target
National Bank (the Bank), as Servicer, complied in
all material respects with the administration and servicing requirements of
Article III, Article IV, and Section 8.8 of the Amended and Restated Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, dated April 28, 2000, and the applicable provisions of
the Series 2002-1 Supplement, dated July 2, 2002, and the Series 2005-1
Supplement, dated November 9, 2005, to the Target Credit Card Master Trust, as
set forth in Exhibit A to the accompanying Report of Management on Compliance
as of December 31, 2005, and for the fiscal year then ended. The Bank s
management is responsible for the Bank s compliance with those requirements.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion based on
our examination.  

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Bank s
compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal
determination on the Bank s compliance with specified requirements.  

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Bank complied with the
aforementioned requirements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005, is
fairly stated, in all material respects.
