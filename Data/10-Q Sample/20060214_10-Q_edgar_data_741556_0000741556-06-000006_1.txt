        Statements        

1.
       Basis of Presentation:   

The
      unaudited
      interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have
      been
      prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
      Commission.  Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures
      normally included in complete financial statements prepared in accordance
      with United States generally accepted accounting principles have been
      omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.  The accompanying unaudited
      interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes should
      be
      read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
      included in the Technology Research Corporation (the "Company") Annual
      Report on  Form
      10-KSB  for the year ended March 31, 2005.  

The
      information furnished reflects, in the opinion of the management of the Company,
      all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial results
      for
      the interim periods presented.  

2.  Earnings
      per share:  

Basic earnings
      per share have been computed by dividing net income by the   weighted
      average number of common shares outstanding. 

Diluted earnings
      per share have been computed by dividing net income by the   weighted
      average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding. 
  The
      weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding has been
  adjusted
      to include the number of shares that would have been outstanding if   the
      stock
      options had been exercised, at the average market price of the   period,
      with the proceeds being used to buy shares from the market  .   

The
      table
      below reconciles the calculation of basic and diluted earnings   per
      share: 

For
      the
      three-month period and nine-month period ended December 31, 2005, options
      to purchase 506,900 shares   of
      common
      stock were considered anti-dilutive for the purposes of calculating   earnings
      per share.  For the three-month and nine-month period ended December 31,
      2004, options to purchase   255,400
      and 245,400 shares   of
      common
      stock, respectively, were considered anti-dilutive for purposes of
      calculating   earnings
      per share. 

3.  Short-term investments:  

Short-term
      investments totaled $498,127 as of December 31, 2005 and
      consisted of $1,752 of corporate securities and $496,375 of U.S. Treasury Bills
      at original cost plus accrued interest.  As of March 31, 2005, short-term
      investments totaled $487,072 and consisted of corporate securities of $2,079
      and  $484,993 of U.S. Treasury Bills at original cost plus accrued
      interest.  The Company considers all of its short-term investments to be
 held-to-maturity , and therefore, are recorded at amortized
      cost. 

4.
       Inventories:  

Inventories
      consist of the following:  

5.
          Warranty:   

The
      Company
      generally provides a one year warranty period for all of its products.  The
      Company also provides coverage on certain of its surge products for "downstream"
      damage of products not manufactured by the Company.  The Company's warranty
      provision represents management's best estimate of probable liabilities,
      calculated as a function of sales volume and historical repair experience for
      each product under warranty.  A roll-forward of the activity in the
      Company's warranty liability for the three and nine months
      ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 is as follows: 

6.  Debt:   

On
                December
                22, 2005, the Company extended the maturity date of the revolving
                credit agreement with its institutional lender to September 30,
                2007.  The loan facility provides for borrowings up to
                $6,000,000.  The Company has the option of borrowing at the lender's prime
                rate of interest minus 100 basis points or the 30-day London Interbank
                Offering Rate ("LIBOR") plus 160 basis points.  The Company is currently
                borrowing under the LIBOR option (6.01% as of December 31,
                2005).  The loan is collateralized with a perfected first security
                interest which attaches to all of its accounts receivable and
                inventories, and a blanket security interest attaching to all of its
                assets, and requires the Company to maintain certain financial
                ratios.  As of December 31, 2005, the Company had
                $3,000,000 in outstanding borrowings, of which $1,000,000 was recorded
                as current portion of long-term debt and $2,000,000 was recorded as
                long-term debt, less current portion.  The Company has the right to
                prepay any outstanding borrowings at any time and intends to repay
                the
                $1,000,000 in current portion of long-term debt prior to December 31,
                2006, and accordingly, the Company has classified this amount as
                a current
                liability.  The Company was in compliance with the covenants under the
                revolving credit agreement as of December 31, 2005. 

On
                  April 14,
                  2005, the Company entered into a $3,000,000 six-month term loan
                  agreement with
                  its institutional lender.  This credit facility was only to be used in the
                  event that the Company's cash requirements extended beyond the
                  existing line of
                  credit noted above.  The provisions of the term loan agreement are
                  substantively identical to those of the existing line of credit.  No
                  borrowings were made under this term loan agreement.  On October 13,
                  2005, this credit facility was extended for 90 days.  The credit facility
                  expired unused on January 14, 2006. 

7.
                   Stock-Based
                  Compensation:   

The
      Company
      accounts for stock options at intrinsic value in accordance with Accounting
      Principles Board Opinion No. 25, " Accounting for Stock Issued to
      Employees"  ("APB 25"), and related interpretations.  Had compensation
      cost for the Company s stock options been determined based upon the fair value
      at the grant date for awards under the plans consistent with the methodology
      prescribed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
      " Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation"  ("SFAS 123"), the Company s net
      income (loss) would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated
      below: 

In
          December 2004, the
          Financial Accounting Standards Board published Statement of Financial Accounting
          Standards No. 123R (Revised 2004),  Share-Based Payment  ("SFAS 123R"),
          which is effective for small business issuers from the first annual period
          that
          begins after December 15, 2005, that will require compensation cost related
          to
          share-based payment transactions, including stock options, be recognized
          in the
          financial statements.  Accordingly, the Company will implement the revised
          standard in its first quarter ending June 30, 2006.  Currently, the Company
          accounts for its share-based payment transactions under the provisions
          of APB
          25, which does not necessarily require the recognition of compensation
          cost in
          the consolidated statement of operations. 

On
          May 24,
          2005, in response to SFAS 123R, the Company's Board of Directors approved
          accelerating the vesting of all out-of-the-money, unvested stock options
          held by
          current employees, including executive officers and directors, effective
          May 25,
          2005.  An option was considered out-of-the-money if, on the effective
          date, the stated option exercise price was greater than the closing price
          of the
          Company's common stock, $5.07.    The
          decision to accelerate vesting of these options was made primarily to avoid
          recognizing significant compensation cost in the Company's future financial
          statements upon the effectiveness of SFAS 123R. 

Stock
          compensation expense, net of tax, in the amount of $30,720 for
          the nine months ended December 31, 2005 was related to
          the acceleration of the unvested stock options for Jerry T. Kendall,
          former President and Chief Executive Officer, as specified in
          his  Separation from Service Agreement  dated August 1,
          2005.  These options expired unexercised on November 1, 2005.

      acceptance, risks, the presence of competitors with greater financial resources,
      product development and commercialization risks, changing economic conditions
      in
      developing countries, and an inability to arrange additional debt or equity
      financing.  More information about factors that potentially could

OVERVIEW   

Technology
          Research
          Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida in
          1981 (the "Company" or "TRC").  TRC is an internationally recognized
          leader in the design, manufacture and marketing of electrical safety products
          that save lives, protect people against serious injury from electrical
          shock and prevent electrical fires in the home and workplace.  Based on its
          core technology in ground fault sensing and leakage current detection,
          the
          Company's products are designed to meet the needs of the consumer, commercial
          and industrial markets worldwide.  TRC also supplies power monitoring and
          control equipment to the United States military and its prime contractors

          tactical vehicles, naval vessels and mobile electric generators. 

The
          Company's
          core commercial and military product applications form the foundation upon
          which
          its technological expertise may be further refined and applied to new product
          offerings and resulting business expansion.  The Company's  Fire
          Shield   and  Surge Guard Plus   product lines are examples of such a
          strategy, and the Company is now focused on developing the markets for
          these
          products to their full potential.  The most
          recent significant opportunity for the Company's commercial market
          expansion was created by the adoption of the Underwriter's Laboratory ("UL")
          requirement for cord fire protection on room air conditioners ("RAC")
          manufactured for domestic sale after August 1, 2004.  The
          Company's  Fire Shield   Leakage Current Detection Interrupter
          ("LCDI") Power Cord effectively responds to such requirement, and the Company
          will continue to pursue additional UL mandates for other applications
          which could benefit from the Company's technologies.  

The
            Company's
            revenues related to the new RAC market in fiscal 2005 were
            approximately $12.5 million, and based upon the orders that the Company
            has
            received through the nine-month period ended December 31, 2005, the Company
            expects continued growth in this market in fiscal 2006.  Revenues relating
            to the Company's RAC products are seasonal with the majority of revenues
            being generated during the Company's first, third and fourth fiscal
            quarters.  The Company expects to achieve modest
            growth in its non-RAC commercial products with military revenues
            remaining steady in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal
            2005.   

The
            Company s
            primary challenge for fiscal 2005 was to penetrate the new RAC
            market.  In implementing its plan to support this new market, the
            Company incurred additional operating expenses and start-up costs, including
            those associated with manufacturing inefficiencies, warranty repair costs,
            freight expense and higher than expected material costs, all of which
            negatively
            impacted net income.  The timing and customization of RAC orders and the
            implementation and coordination of ramping up its manufacturing plant
            in
            Honduras and bringing on line several Far East contract manufacturers
            in a
            compressed time frame presented significant challenges in meeting the
            demands of
            this new market.  The first RAC season effectively ended during the month
            of May 2005, and except for certain RAC products which are shipped year
            round,
            the next RAC season began in November 2005 and will run through May of
            2006.  The Company has performed more efficiently in the second
            RAC season than in the first by leveraging its fiscal 2005 capital
            investment and expanding its manufacturing capabilities. 

The
          Company's
          operating strategy is based on these key objectives: 

to increase
              profitability by improving operating efficiencies; 

to
              strengthen and expand its markets and distribution channels; 

to
              broaden the applications within target markets for its existing
              products; 

to
              expand the scope of its product content; 

to
              expand its manufacturing capabilities; 

to
              maintain a conservative capital structure; and 

to
              pursue strategic acquisitions to the extent favorable opportunities
              are
              presented. 

Actual
      results could, however, differ materially from those projected or assumed
      in any of its forward-looking statements within this report.  The Company's
      future financial condition and results of operations, as well as its operational
      and financial expectations, are subject to inherent risks and
      uncertainties.  Some, but not all, of the factors impacting these risks and
      uncertainties are set forth below in section Item 1A, entitled  Risk
      Factors . 

RESULTS OF
        OPERATIONS   

Revenues  
        for the third quarter ended December 31, 2005 were
        $11,354,302 compared to $9,704,795 reported in the same quarter last
        year, an increase of 17.0%.  Commercial revenues, which includes RAC
        revenues, increased by $1,036,057 and military revenues increased by
        $616,081.    Revenues
        for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2005 were $30,592,737 compared
        to
        $23,905,266 reported in the same period of the prior year, an increase of
        28.0%.    Commercial
        and military revenues increased by $6,493,394 and $254,090,
        respectively, and royalties decreased by $60,013.   

The
        increase
        in commercial revenues for the three and nine-month periods ended
        December 31, 2005, compared to the same periods of the prior year, was primarily
        attributed to RAC product shipments, and to a lesser extent, product expansion
        into retail stores and brand label shipments.  The Company expects
        continued growth in its commercial revenues in the fourth
        quarter of fiscal 2006.  Military revenues grew for the
        second consecutive quarter, which resulted from the Company receiving,
        after a delay in the first quarter, (i) certain follow-on releases of
        existing contracts for control devices related to the Tactical Quiet Generator
        ("TQG") programs; and (ii) certain direct military orders that could not
        be
        placed until June, when the Department of Defense released supplemental spending
        for its fiscal 2005 year.  The Company expects military sales in
        fiscal 2006 to remain comparable to fiscal 2005.  The decrease in royalty
        income for the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2005,
        compared to the same periods of the prior year, was due to
        non-recurring royalties, which were recorded in the prior year's
        quarter.  The Company does not expect to record any significant
        royalties   in
        fiscal
        2006. 

Gross
          profit
  increased $800,772, or 39.0%, to $2,852,586 for the three
          months
          ended December 31, 2005 and increased $107,605, or 1.6%, to $6,924,626
          for the
          nine months ended December 31, 2005.  The increase for the quarter
          ended December 31, 2005 was due to an increase in the volume of sales and
          to a reduction in freight costs compared with the third quarter of the
          prior
          fiscal year.  The increase for the nine months ended December 31, 2005 from
          the comparable prior year period is due to an increase in sales volume
          largely
          offset by product mix.  Gross profit as a percentage of total revenues
          increased from 21.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2004 to 25.1%
          for
          the three months ended December 31, 2005.  This increase in gross profit as
          a percent of revenues was primarily due to improved efficiencies in the
          manufacture and distribution of the RAC products as well as product mix. 
Gross profit as a percent of revenues declined from 28.5% for the nine
          months
          ended December 31, 2004 to 22.6% for the nine months ended December 31,
          2005.  The decrease was primarily related to product warranty cost and
          severance cost in the Company's first and second quarters of fiscal
          2006 plus higher raw material costs, primarily those related to plastic and
          copper.  The Company does not expect the cost of copper or plastic to
          materially change for the remainder of fiscal 2006. 

Selling
            and
            marketing   expense decreased $12,138 , or 1.9%, to $643,633 for the
            quarter ended December 31, 2005 compared with $655,771 for the same quarter
            last
            year. For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2005, selling and
            marketing
            expense increased $13,724, or .7% to $1,850,510 compared with $1,836,786
            for the
            same period last year.  As a percentage of revenues, selling and marketing
            expense declined 1.1% and 1.7%, respectively, for the three and nine
            month
            periods ended December 31, 2005.  The decrease in selling and marketing
            expense as a percentage of revenues for the three and nine month periods,
            was
            primarily due to the 17.0% and 28.0% increase in revenues, respectively.

General
            and
            administrative   expense increased $40,318, or 6.0%, to $707,483 for
            the quarter ended December 31, 2005 compared with $667,165 for the same
            quarter
            last year.  For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2005, general and
            administrative expense increased $575,518, or 31.7% to $2,392,680 compared
            with
            $1,817,162 for the same period last year.  The expense increase quarter
            over quarter was primarily due to legal fees related to the Company s patent
            infringement suit against Tower Manufacturing Corporation and Fedders
            Corporation. For the nine-month period, the expense increase was mainly
            attributable to $238,000 in legal fees related to the Company s patent
            infringement suit, $132,000 in salaries primarily related to Jerry T.
            Kendall s
            (former President and CEO) termination package, $96,000 in legal and
            audit fees,
            $54,000 in write-offs of accounts receivable, and $53,000 for consulting
            fees
            related to section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley.  As a percentage of revenues,
            general and administrative expense increased .7% and .2% , respectively,
            for the
            three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2005.  The increase in
            general and administrative expense as a percent of revenues for the three
            and
            nine month periods was primarily due to the above-described increases
            in
            expenses mostly offset by the 17.0% and 28.0% increase in revenues,
            respectively. 

Research
                and
                development   expense decreased $146,606, or 25.9% to $418,827 for
                the quarter ended December 31, 2005 compared with $565,433 in the
                same quarter
                last year.  For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2005, research and
                development expense decreased $89,077, or 5.8% to $1,444,250 compared
                with
                $1,533,327 for the same period last year.  The decrease for both periods
                was primarily due to lower salary expense as a result of a reduction
                in force in
                the second quarter of fiscal 2006, offset in part by higher UL fees
                for the nine
                month period.  As a percent of revenues, research and development expense
                declined 2.1% and 1.7% , respectively, for the three and nine month
                periods
                ended December 31, 2005.  The decrease in research and development expense
                as a percent of revenues for the three and nine month periods was
                primarily due
                to the above-described decrease in salary expense and to the 17.0%
                and 28.0%
                increase in revenues, respectively. 

Other income
      (expense)   was $(49,933) of expense for the quarter ended December
      31, 2005, compared to income of $5,853 in the same quarter last year,
      an increase in expense of $55,786.    For
      the
      nine-month period ended December 31, 2005, other income and expense was
      an expense of $(144,361), compared to income of $19,723 for the same
      period last year, an increase in expense of
      $164,084.    The
      increase in expense for the three and nine-month periods ended December 31,
      2005
      over the comparable prior year periods was attributed to interest expense
      associated with a higher loan balance and less cash and cash equivalents and
      short-term investment balances on which to earn
      interest.   

Income
      tax
      expense   as   a percent of income before income taxes
      was 20.0% for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005,
      compared with 3.8% and 30.0% for the three and nine months ended December
      31, 2004, respectively.  The Company's effective tax rate varies
      based primarily on the mix of income before income taxes derived from the
      Company's Honduran subsidiary, which is not subject to income taxes, and the
      balance of income before income taxes, which is subject to U.S. income
      taxes.  At each reporting period, the Company makes its best estimate of
      the effective tax rate expected for the full fiscal year and applies that rate
      to the current year-to-date income before income taxes.  Any difference
      between the current and preceding estimated effective tax rate expected for
      the
      full fiscal year is reflected as an adjustment in the current quarter's income
      tax expense.  The Company's income tax expense was only 3.8% of income in
      the third quarter of last year, because the Company reduced its estimate of
      the
      effective tax rate from 33.0% to 30.0% during that quarter resulting in the
      lower quarterly tax rate.  In accordance with SFAS 109,  Accounting
      for Income Taxes , the Company does not record deferred income taxes on the
      foreign undistributed earnings of an investment in a foreign subsidiary that
      is
      essentially permanent in duration.  If circumstances change, and it becomes
      apparent that some or all of the undistributed earnings of the subsidiary will
      be remitted in the foreseeable future, but U.S. income taxes have not been
      recognized by the Company, the Company will record as an expense of the current
      period the U.S. income taxes attributed to that remittance.  

Net income   for the quarter ended December 31,
        2005 was $826,168, compared to net income of $162,913,
        in the same quarter last year, an increase of $663,255.  Basic
        and diluted earnings per share were $.14 for the quarter ended
        December 31, 2005, compared to basic and diluted earnings of $.03 per
        share for the same quarter last year.    Net
        income for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2005 was
        $874,260, compared to $1,154,628, for the same period in the prior year, a
        decrease of $280,368.  Basic and diluted earnings per share were $.15
        for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2005, compared to basic earnings
        of
        $.20 per share and diluted earnings of $.19 for the same period of the
        prior year.  Net income for the three and nine-month periods ended
        December 31, 2005, compared to comparable periods, was impacted
        by those factors mentioned above. 

LIQUIDITY AND
          CAPITAL RESOURCES   

As
      of December 31, 2005, the Company's cash and cash equivalents
      increased to $1,216,631 from $815,411 as of March 31, 2005. 
Cash provided by operating activities was $3,591,474, cash
      used by investing activities was $602,130 and cash used by
      financing activities was $2,588,124, resulting in a total increase
      of $401,220 for the nine-month period ended December 31,
      2005.   

Cash provided by
      operating activities was primarily due to net income of $874,260,
      depreciation in the amount of $932,353 and a decrease in accounts
      receivable and inventories of $4,100,635 and $328,688, respectively, offset
      in part by a decrease in accounts payable of $2,482,640 and accrued
      expenses of $421,909.  The decrease in accounts
      receivable was primarily due to collections resulting from the Company's
      RAC customers.  Inventories decreased as a result of the
      Company using inventories for the new RAC season, which were
      purchased earlier in the fiscal year.  In general, due to the seasonality
      of the RAC market, accounts receivable and accounts payable will decrease
      in the Company's first and second fiscal quarters and increase in the
      Company's third and fourth fiscal quarters.  The decrease in accounts
      payable and accrued expenses was primarily the result of the
      Company's increased liquidity.   

Cash
      used by investing activities was primarily for purchases of capital
      equipment.  The Company s capital expenditures were $595,986 for
      the nine-month period ended December 31, 2005, compared to $3,292,439 for the
      same period last year, at which time the Company was tooling
      up for increased production to support the new RAC market in
      fiscal 2005. 

Cash used by financing
      activities was primarily due to the net reduction in debt in the
      amount of $2,350,000 and payments of $259,766 in cash
      dividends. 

On
        December
        22, 2005, the Company extended the maturity date of the revolving
        credit agreement with its institutional lender to September 30,
        2007.  The loan facility provides for borrowings up to
        $6,000,000.  The Company has the option of borrowing at the lender's prime
        rate of interest minus 100 basis points or the 30-day London Interbank
        Offering Rate ("LIBOR") plus 160 basis points.  The Company is currently
        borrowing under the LIBOR option (6.01% as of December 31,
        2005).  The loan is collateralized with a perfected first security
        interest which attaches to all of its accounts receivable and
        inventories, and a blanket security interest attaching to all of its
        assets, and requires the Company to maintain certain financial
        ratios.  As of December 31, 2005, the Company had
        $3,000,000 in outstanding borrowings, of which $1,000,000 was recorded
        as current portion of long-term debt and $2,000,000 was recorded as
        long-term debt, less current portion.  The Company has the right to
        prepay any outstanding borrowings at any time and intends to repay the
        $1,000,000 in current portion of long-term debt prior to December 31,
        2006, and accordingly, the Company has classified this amount as a current
        liability.  The Company was in compliance with the covenants under the
        revolving credit agreement as of December 31, 2005. 

On
          April 14,
          2005, the Company entered into a $3,000,000 six-month term loan agreement
          with
          its institutional lender.  This credit facility was intended to be
          used in the event that the Company's cash requirements extend beyond the
          existing line of credit noted above.  The provisions of the term loan
          agreement were substantively identical to those of the existing line of
          credit.  No borrowings were made under this term loan agreement. 
On October 13, 2005, this credit facility was extended for 90 days.  The
          credit facility expired unused on January 14, 2006. 

The
        Company believes
        cash flow from operations, the available bank borrowings and cash and cash
        equivalents will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements for
        the
        next 12 months. 

OFF-BALANCE
        SHEET ARRANGEMENTS   

The
          Company
          does not have financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities, such
          as
          entities often referred to as structured finance or variable
          interest entities, which are often established for the purposes of
          facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow
          or
          limited purposes.  As a result, the Company is not exposed to any financing
          , liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if the Company had such
          relationships. 

NEW
          ACCOUNTING STANDARDS   

In
      November
      2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
      (SFAS) No. 151 -  Inventory Costs , to amend the guidance in Chapter
      4, "Inventory Pricing", of FASB Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43,
 Restatement and Revision of Accounting Research Bulletins .  SFAS
      No. 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
      freight, handling costs and waste material (spoilage).  The Statement
      requires that items be recognized as current-period charges.  Additionally,
      SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the
      costs
      of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
      facilities.  The adoption of SFAS No. 151 is not expected to have a
      material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of
      operations or cash flows. 

In December 2004,
      the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R) -  Accounting for Stock-Based
      Compensation .  SFAS No. 123(R) is a revision of SFAS No. 123 and
      supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock issued to
      Employees , and its related implementation guidance.  This statement
      establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity
      exchanges its equity for goods and services.  It also addresses
      transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or
      services that are based on the fair market value of the entity's equity
      instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity
      instruments.  The statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of
      employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based
      on the grant-date fair value of the award.  That cost is recognized over
      the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange
      for the award.  This statement is effective for small business issuers as
      of the beginning of the first interim or annual period that begins after
      December 15, 2005.  Depending on the nature and extent of any future
      share-based payments, the application of SFAS No. 123(R) may have a
      material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations
      and
      cash flows. 

In
        December
        2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets," effective
        for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after
        June
        15, 2005.  APB Opinion No. 29, "Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions,"
        was based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be
        measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged.  The guidance in
        that Opinion, however, included certain exceptions to that principle.  SFAS
        153 amends Opinion 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges
        of
        similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges
        of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance.  The adoption
        of SFAS 153 will only affect the Company s financial condition and results of
        operations if it has such exchanges in the future. 

In
        May 2005,
        the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,  Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, 
effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal
        years
        beginning after December 15, 2005.  SFAS 154 replaces APB Opinion 20 and
        SFAS 3.  Among other changes, SFAS 154 requires retrospective application
        to prior periods  financial statements of changes in accounting principle,
        unless it is impractical to determine either the periods-specific effects
        or the
        cumulative effect of the change.  SFAS 154 also requires that a change in
        depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long-lived non-financial
        assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a
        change
        in accounting principle.  The adoption of SFAS 154 will only affect the
        Company s financial condition and results of operations if it has such changes
        or corrections of errors in the future. 

CRITICAL
        ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
            preparation of
            financial statements and related disclosures, in conformity with United
            States
            generally accepted accounting principles, requires management to make
            judgments,
            assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported.  Certain of
            these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting
            policies, as defined below.  

A
            critical accounting
            policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of
            the
            Company s financial statements and requires management to make difficult,
            subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on
            the
            Company s financial condition and results of operations.  Specifically,
            critical accounting estimates have the following attributes:  (i) the
            Company is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly
            uncertain
            at the time of the estimate; and (ii) different estimates the Company
            could
            reasonably have used, or changes in the estimates actually used resulting
            from
            events that could be reasonably foreseen as likely to have a
            material effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations.

Estimates
              and
              assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined
              with
              certainty.  The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on
              various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable
              under the
              circumstances.  These estimates may change as new events occur, as
              additional information is obtained and as the Company s operating environment
              changes.  These changes have historically been minor and have been included
              in the consolidated financial statements once known.  In addition,
              management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of
              which are
              not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods
              of time.
 These uncertainties are discussed in the section above entitled
 Forward-Looking Statements  and in section Item 1A below, entitled
 Risk Factors .  Based on a critical assessment of its accounting
              policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the
              application of those policies, management believes that the Company s
              consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with
              United
              States generally accepted accounting principles and present a meaningful
              presentation of the Company s financial condition and results of
              operations.  

Management
            believes
            that the following are critical accounting policies: 

Revenue
          Recognition.    The Company recognizes revenue from commercial
          customers when an order has been received, pricing is fixed, title to the
          product has passed and collectibility is reasonably assured.  Title
          generally passes upon shipment to the customer; however, in a limited number
          of
          cases, title passes upon receipt of shipment by the customer.  There are no
          customer acceptance provisions included in the Company's sales contracts
          and the
          Company has no installation obligation subsequent to product shipment. 
Similarly, revenue from sales to distributors is recognized as title passes
          to
          them without additional involvement or obligation.  Collection of
          receivables related to distributor sales is not contingent upon subsequent
          sales
          to third parties.   

The
          Company
          may enter into government contracts that fall within the scope of Statement
          of
          Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain
          Production-Type Contracts (SOP 81-1) ("non-standard" products) or fall
          outside
          the scope of SOP 81-1 ("standard" products).  For government contracts
          within the scope of SOP 81-1, the Company records revenue under a units
          of
          delivery model with revenues and costs equal to the average unit value
          times the
          number of units delivered.  Any estimated loss on an overall contract would
          be recognized in the period determined in accordance with SOP 81-1.  For
          government contracts outside the scope of SOP 81-1, the Company records
          revenue
          the same as commercial customers discussed above and would record a loss
          in the
          event the costs to fulfill a government contract are in excess of the associated
          revenues.  The Company has not experienced past losses on government
          contracts.    

Allowance
              for Doubtful Accounts.    The Company records an allowance for
              estimated losses resulting from the inability of isolated customers to
              make timely payments of amounts due on account of product
              purchases.  The Company assesses the credit worthiness
              of its customers based on multiple sources of information, including
              publicly available credit data, subscription based credit reports, trade
              association data, and analyzes factors such as historical bad debt
              experience,
              changes in customer payment terms or payment patterns, credit risk
              related to
              industry and geographical location and economic trends. This assessment
              requires
              significant judgment.  If the financial condition of the
              Company's customers were to worsen, additional write-offs could be
              required, resulting in write-offs not included in the
              Company's current allowance for doubtful accounts. 

Income
            Taxes .   Significant management judgment is required in
            developing the Company s provision for income taxes, including the determination
            of any accrual for tax contingencies, any foreign withholding taxes or
            any
            United States income taxes on undistributed earnings of the foreign subsidiary,
            deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that
            might be
            required to be applied against the deferred tax assets.  It is the
            Company's intention to reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign
            subsidiary
            and thereby indefinitely postpone their repatriation.  Accordingly, no
            provision has been made for foreign withholding taxes or United States
            income
            taxes which may become payable if undistributed earnings of its foreign
            subsidiary are paid as dividends to the Company.  The Company applies the
            Comparable Profits Method for transfer pricing to determine the amounts
            its
            subsidiary charges to the parent.

Warranty .  
            The Company generally provides a one year warranty period for all of
            its
            products.  The Company also provides coverage on certain of its surge
            products for "downstream" damage of products not manufactured by the
            Company.  The Company's warranty provision represents management's estimate
            of probable liabilities, calculated as a function of sales volume and
            historical
            repair experience for each product under warranty.  The Company's warranty
            reserve represents the Company's estimate of its liability for warranty
            repairs
            that it will incur over the warranty period. 

Inventories.   
              Because of the lead times required to obtain certain raw materials,
              we must
              maintain sufficient quantities on hand to meet expected product demand
              for each
              of our many products.  If actual demand is much lower than forecasted, we
              may not be able to dispose of our inventory at or above its cost.  We write
              down our inventory for estimated excess and obsolete amounts to the
              lower of
              cost or market.  We review the reasonableness of our estimates each quarter
              (or more frequently).  A reserve is established for inventory that has had
              no activity for long periods of time or for which management believes
              is no
              longer salable.  This reserve is reviewed and approved by the senior
              management team.  In the future, based on our quarterly analysis, if we
              estimate that any remaining reserve for obsolescence is either inadequate
              or in
              excess of the inventory reserve required, we may need to adjust it.
              At present,
              based on our analysis, we believe the reserve is properly valued for
              the
              inventory held by us. 

Impairment
                of
                Long-Lived Assets.    The Company reviews long-lived assets for
                possible impairment of carrying value whenever events or changes
                in
                circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
                be
                recoverable in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
                Standards No.
                144,  Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets . 
In evaluating the fair value and future benefit of the
                Company's assets, management performs an analysis of the anticipated
                undiscounted future net cash flows to be derived from the use of
                individual assets over their remaining amortization period.  If the
                carrying amount of an asset exceeds its anticipated undiscounted
                cash flows, the
                Company recognizes an impairment loss equal to the difference between
                its carrying value and its fair value. 

Item
                  3.  Quantitative   and Qualitative
                  Disclosures About Market Risk.  

The
                  Company
                  has no derivative instruments as of December 31, 2005.  The
                  Company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates
                  primarily to the Company s debt obligations due to its variable LIBOR Rate
                  pricing.  Accordingly, a 1.0% change in LIBOR would result in an annual
                  interest expense change of approximately $30,000. 

Item
                4.  Controls and
                Procedures  .  

As
            of the end of the
            period covered by this interim report on Form 10-Q, the Company carried
            out,
            under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief
            Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ) (the  Certifying
            Officers ), an evaluation of the effectiveness of its  disclosure controls and
            procedures  (as the term is defined under Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e)
            promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended).  Based
            on this evaluation, the Certifying Officers have concluded that the Company s
            disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  

Further,
            there were
            no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the
            Company s third fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are
            reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over
            financial reporting.  

PART
            II   OTHER
            INFORMATION   

Item
      1.  Legal Proceedings.   

On
        August 3,
        2005, the Company filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court,
        Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division, against Tower Manufacturing
        Corporation (Tower), of Providence, R. I., alleging willful infringement
        of U.S.
        Patent No. 6,292,337, which underlies the Company s  Fire Shield  
technology for cord fire prevention.  The Company alleges in the lawsuit
        that the Tower LCDI, found on portable room air conditioners, infringes TRC s
        patent.  As described in the Complaint, the Company is seeking injunctive
        relief, damages for infringement, cost recovery and any other relief deemed
        just
        by the Court.  On September 13, 2005, the Company added Fedders Corporation
        (NYSE-FJC), a global manufacturer of air treatment products, including room
        air
        conditioners, as a defendant in the previously filed lawsuit against Tower
        Manufacturing Corporation.  The amended complaint alleges that the Tower
        LCDI, found on the Fedders room air conditioners, infringes TRC s
        patent. 

The Company is involved in various other claims and
        legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.  In the opinion
        of the Company, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a
        material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of
        operations or cash flows.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors.  

Shareholders
          and investors should carefully consider the following risk factors,
          together with the other information contained in this Form 10-Q and in
          our Annual Report on Form 10-KSB, before making any investment decision
          with respect to the Company's securities:  

Failure
              to achieve our operating strategy 

Access
              to capital to fund growth 

Availability
              and cost increases in raw materials and components 

The
              loss of or significant decrease in sales to large customers 

Adverse
              changes in the operations of global manufacturing facilities 

Interruptions in
              manufacturing operations 

Infringement
              or loss of proprietary rights 

Seasonality 

Competition from
              larger companies that produce similar products 

Newly
              acquired businesses or product lines 

Government
              regulations could adversely impact our operations 

The
          scope,
          complexity and seasonality of the RAC market has and continues
          to place substantial demands on our production
          capabilities, information technology systems and other resources. 
To service this market effectively, we must: (i) maintain a
          high level of manufacturing quality and efficiency; (ii) properly
          manage our third party suppliers and independent sub-contract
          manufacturers; (iii) continue to enhance our operational, financial and
          management systems, including our database management, inventory control
          and distribution systems; (iv) expand, train and manage our employee base;
          (v) compete with aggressive price cutting by competitors; and (vi) vigorously
          protect and defend our  Fire Shield   patents and intellectual
          property.  

Regarding
          compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, weaknesses
          in
          internal control over financial reporting, currently unknown, may be identified
          as we document, test, and assess such controls. 

The
          risks
          listed above are not the only risks that we face.  Additional risks
          that are not yet known or that we currently believe to be immaterial may
          also impair business operations.

             In
      December
      2005, the Company hired Barry H. Black as its Chief Financial Officer, effective

                All
                significant
                deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
                internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely
                to
                adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize
                and report financial information; and 

b.  
             
                Any

 CHANGE OF CONTROL AGREEMENT - BARRY H. BLACK, CFO

CHANGE OF CONTROL AGREEMENT - BARRY H. BLACK, CFO

Exhibit
      10.1  

       CHANGE
      OF CONTROL AGREEMENT  

THIS
      CHANGE OF CONTROL AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is entered into as of  
      January
      23, 2006, by and between Technology Research Corporation, a Florida corporation
      (the "Company"), and Barry H. Black ("Executive"). 

BACKGROUND
      INFORMATION  

On
      January 3, 2006, the Company issued a press release announcing that Executive
      was appointed as Vice President of Finance and Chief Executive Officer of the
      Company and further noted that the Company and Executive would formalize a
      change of control agreement by January 31, 2006. Because the Company and
      Executive have agreed that should a change in control or ownership in the
      Company occur, or a change in the Chief Executive Officer of the Company occur
      and the Executive s employment is terminated for other than Cause or his
      voluntary resignation, Executive shall be entitled to a severance payment equal
      to one year of salary, but all employee benefits will terminate on the
      Executive s termination date. Because the Company recognizes that the
  uncertainty
      which might arise in the context of a change in control of the
      Company  
      or
      change in the position of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company could
      result in the distraction or departure of Executive to the detriment of the
      Company and its shareholders, t  he
      Company and the Executive desire to set forth in this Agreement  
      the
      terms and conditions that will trigger a severance payment   upon
      a
      change in the position of Chief Executive Officer or actual change  
      of
      control of the Company. 

In
      consideration of the mutual promises herein contained, and  
      for
      other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
      are
      hereby acknowledged, the Company and the Executive agree as
      follows: 

OPERATIVE
      PROVISIONS  

      1.       DEFINITIONS  

1.1      "   Term   "
      shall
      mean the period commencing with the effective date of this Agreement and
      continuing until the Executive s employment with the Company is
      terminated. 

1.2      "   Cause   "
      shall
      mean a termination of Executive's employment which is a result of

                conviction;

                Company
                (other than any such failure resulting from his incapacity due to
                physical
                or mental illness or any such actual or anticipated failure resulting
                from
                a resignation by Executive for Good Reason) after a written demand
                for
                performance is delivered to Executive by the Company, which demand
                specifically identifies the manner in which the Company believes
                that
                Executive has not substantially performed Executive's duties, and
                which
                performance is not substantially corrected by Executive within a
                period of
                time to be specified by the Company's Board of Directors (the  Board").
                For purposes of the previous sentence, no act or failure to act on
                Executive's part shall be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted
                , by
                Executive in bad faith or without a good faith, reasonable belief
                that

      consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, or (C) the sale or
      disposition of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or the adoption
      of a plan of complete liquidation; 

(iii)

      individuals who, as of the date of this Agreement, (x) constitute the Board
      (the
      "Current Directors"), (y) are individuals nominated to the Board by the Current
      Directors, or are individuals nominated by the Company for election at an annual
      meeting of the Company's stockholders, cease for any reason to constitute at
      least a majority of the Board; or 

(iv)
      a
      change in the Company s Chief Executive Officer occurs, thereby resulting in the
      resignation, retirement or appointment of a successor to the Company s current
      Chief Executive Officer.

      on which the Change of Control occurs; 

(ii)     the
      date

      result in the occurrence of a Change in Control; and 

(iii)     the
      date
      the Board approves a transaction or series of transactions, the consummation
      of
      which would result in a Change in Control.
