BROWN-FORMAN CORPORATION
            NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                   (Unaudited)

In these notes, "we," "us," and "our" refer to Brown-Forman Corporation.

1.   Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

We  prepared  these  unaudited  condensed  consolidated   statements  using  our
customary accounting practices as set out in our 2005 annual report on Form 10-K
(the "2005 Annual Report").  We made all of the adjustments  (which include only
normal, recurring adjustments) needed for a fair statement of this data.

We condensed or omitted some of the  information  found in financial  statements
prepared according to generally accepted  accounting  principles  ("GAAP").  You
should read these  financial  statements  together with the 2005 Annual  Report,
which does conform to GAAP.

2.   Inventories

We use the last-in,  first-out  ("LIFO") method to determine the cost of most of
our  inventories.  If the LIFO method had not been used,  inventories at current
cost would have been $141.6  million  higher than reported as of April 30, 2005,
and $131.8 million  higher than reported as of January 31, 2006.  Changes in the
LIFO  valuation  reserve  for  interim  periods  are  based  on a  proportionate
allocation of the estimated change for the entire fiscal year.

3.   Income Taxes

Our consolidated  effective tax rate may differ from current statutory rates due
to the  recognition of amounts for events or  transactions  that do not have tax
consequences.  We use the estimated annual effective tax rate in determining our
interim results.  The effective tax rate of 30.0% for continuing  operations for
the nine months ended  January 31, 2006,  is based on an expected  effective tax
rate of 32.9% on ordinary  income for the full fiscal year, less the tax benefit
achieved by offsetting  various  capital gains from  continuing  operations (see
Note 11) against the capital loss resulting from the sale of Lenox.

4.   Discontinued Operations

During  July  2005,  we  entered  into  a  definitive   agreement  to  sell  our
wholly-owned  subsidiary Lenox,  Incorporated ("Lenox") for $190 million in cash
(subject to a post-closing working capital  adjustment).  The agreement followed
the February 2005 announcement that we were exploring strategic alternatives for
Lenox,  including a possible sale. On September 1, 2005, we consummated the sale
of substantially all of Lenox to Department 56, Inc.  ("Department 56") for $196
million.  This total was $6 million  higher than  previously  announced due to a
working capital adjustment provision included in the sale agreement.

                                       6

After  consummation  of the sale to Department 56, we retained  ownership of the
Lenox  headquarters  building  and  property  in  Lawrenceville,  New Jersey and
Lenox's Brooks & Bentley,  a former  subsidiary of Lenox,  located in the United
Kingdom.  As of January 31, 2006,  it was our  intention  to sell those  assets,
which are classified as held for sale in the accompanying  consolidated  balance
sheets.  As discussed in Note 13, we  subsequently  sold the Lenox  headquarters
building  and  property.  It  continues  to be our  intention  to sell  Brooks &
Bentley.

In connection  with the  definitive  sales  agreement,  we recognized a non-cash
impairment charge during July 2005 of $59.5 million,  representing the excess of
the  carrying  value  of the net  assets  being  sold  over the  expected  sales
proceeds.  We have also recorded  transaction costs of $10.3 million,  including
investment  banking  fees,  transaction  success  payments,  and legal,  tax and
actuarial expenses.

Due to the sale of Lenox,  its results of operations  through  August 2005,  the
impairment   charge,  and  other  transaction  costs  have  been  classified  as
discontinued operations,  net of income taxes, in the accompanying  consolidated
statements of operations, and its assets and liabilities have been classified as
held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In reports issued
prior to July 2005,  Lenox's  operating results and assets were presented in the
Consumer Durables segment,  of which it comprised the major part. As a result of
the sale,  the  Consumer  Durables  segment  no longer  constitutes  a  separate
reportable segment.

A summary of discontinued operations follows:

5.   Earnings Per Share

Basic  earnings  per share is based upon the weighted  average  number of common
shares  outstanding  during the period.  Diluted earnings per share includes the
dilutive  effect of stock-based  compensation  awards,  including stock options,
stock-settled  stock appreciation  rights ("SSARs"),  and non-vested  restricted
stock.  Stock-based  awards for  approximately  1.1 million  common  shares were
excluded  from the  calculation  of diluted  earnings  per share for the periods
ended  January 31, 2005,  because the exercise  price of the options was greater
than the average market price of the shares. No stock-based awards were excluded
from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the periods ended January
31, 2006.

The following table presents  information  concerning basic and diluted earnings
per share:

We are subject to environmental  regulations in connection with the operation of
our production  facilities and in connection with the transportation of products
we  manufacture.  Violation of these  environmental  regulations  can results in
fines or penalties. As of January 31, 2006, we do not consider the exposure from
the risks of such fines or penalties to be material.

8.   Contingencies

We operate in a litigious  environment,  and we get sued in the normal course of
business. Sometimes plaintiffs seek substantial damages. Significant judgment is
required in predicting the outcome of these suits and claims, many of which take
years to adjudicate. We accrue estimated costs for a contingency when we believe
that a loss is probable and a reasonable  estimate of the loss can be made,  and
adjust the accrual as appropriate to reflect changes in facts and circumstances.

A law firm has sued  Brown-Forman and many other  manufacturers and marketers of
spirits,  wines, and beer in a series of nine very similar class action lawsuits
seeking damages and injunctive relief from alleged marketing of beverage alcohol
to underage consumers.  The suits allege that the defendants engage in deceptive
and negligent marketing  practices  targeting underage  consumers.  They seek to
recover  on behalf of parents  those  funds  that  their  children  spent on the
illegal  purchase of alcohol as well as  disgorgement  of all  profits  from the
alleged illegal sales.  Brown-Forman is vigorously  defending these cases. Three
of the  suits  have  been  dismissed.  Plaintiffs  have  appealed,  or have time
remaining to appeal, those dismissals.  Another was voluntarily dismissed.  Four
others are  pending on motions to  dismiss.  It is not  possible at this time to
predict  the  outcome  of these  claims  but an  unfavorable  result in these or
similar  class  action  lawsuits  could  have a material  adverse  impact on our
business.

We have  contributed  approximately  $21.0  million  to our  pension  and  other
postretirement  benefit  plans during the nine months ended January 31, 2006. We
expect to contribute  approximately  $2.0 million more to those plans during the
fourth quarter.

10.   Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive  income is a broad measure of the effects of all  transactions and
events (other than investments by or  distributions  to  shareholders)  that are
recognized in stockholders' equity, regardless of whether those transactions and
events are included in net income. The following table adjusts the Company's net
income for the other items included in comprehensive income:

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consisted of the following:

                                       11

11.   Other Income

During July 2005, we entered into an agreement  with LVMH Moet  Hennessey  Louis
Vuitton for the early  termination  of our  long-term  importing  and  marketing
agreements for Glenmorangie  products in the United States,  Canada, and certain
countries in Europe and Asia, effective July 29, 2005. We received approximately
$13.5 million for the early termination, which is included in "other income" for
the nine  months  ended  January  31,  2006,  in the  accompanying  consolidated
statement of operations.

During January 2006, we received  proceeds of $24.8 million as compensation  for
Pernod Ricard  assuming the  distribution  of its brands from Swift & Moore,  an
Australian  distribution  company  co-owned  by  Pernod  Ricard  (following  its
purchase of Allied-Domecq)  and Brown-Forman.  This amount is recorded in "other
income" for the periods ended January 31, 2006.  Pernod Ricard  surrendered  its
ownership interest in Swift & Moore to Brown-Forman  effective February 1, 2006,
resulting in Brown-Forman  becoming 100% owner of Swift & Moore as of that date.
Swift & Moore will continue to distribute our brands in Australia.

During  January 2006,  we sold winery land and buildings in California  for $7.0
million,  resulting in a gain of $4.6 million that is included in "other income"
for the periods ended January 31, 2006.

12.   Stock Options

Prior year amounts  have been  restated to reflect the  retroactive  adoption of
FASB Statement No. 123(R),  "Share-Based  Payment," during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005.

13.   Subsequent Event

On  February  10,  2006,  we sold the former  Lenox  headquarters  building  and
property  (included  in  noncurrent  assets  held for  sale in the  accompanying
consolidated  balance sheet as of January 31, 2006) for $9.6 million,  resulting
in a gain of $3.2 million. The gain will be reflected in discontinued operations
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
         and Results of Operations

You should read the following discussion and analysis along with our 2005 Annual
Report.  Note that  the results  of operations for the nine months ended January
31, 2006, do not  necessarily  indicate what our operating  results for the full
fiscal year will be. In this Item,  "we,"  "us," and "our" refer to Brown-Forman
Corporation.

Important Note on Forward-Looking Statements:
This report  contains  statements,  estimates,  or projections  that  constitute
"forward-looking  statements"  as defined under U.S.  federal  securities  laws.
Generally,   the  words  "expect,"  "believe,"  "intend,"   "estimate,"  "will,"
"anticipate," and "project," and similar expressions  identify a forward-looking
statement,  which speaks only as of the date the  statement  is made.  Except as
required  by law,  we do not  intend to update  or  revise  any  forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
We  believe  that  the   expectations   and  assumptions  with  respect  to  our
forward-looking statements are reasonable. But by their nature,  forward-looking
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that
in some  cases are out of our  control.  These  factors  could  cause our actual
results to differ materially from  Brown-Forman's  historical  experience or our
present expectations or projections.  Here is a non-exclusive list of such risks
and uncertainties:

 - changes in general economic conditions, particularly in the United States
   where we earn the majority of our profits;
 - lower consumer confidence or purchasing in the wake of catastrophic events;
 - tax increases, whether at the federal or state level or in major
   international markets and/or tariff barriers or other restrictions affecting
   beverage alcohol;
 - restrictions on alcohol marketing, including advertising and promotion, as a
   result of stricter governmental policies adopted either in the United States
   or globally;
 - adverse developments in the class action lawsuits filed against Brown-Forman
   and other spirits, beer and wine manufacturers alleging that our industry
   conspired to promote the consumption of alcohol by those under the legal
   drinking age;
 - a strengthening U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, especially the
   British Pound;
 - reduced bar, restaurant, hotel and travel business in wake of  terrorist
   attacks or threats, such as occurred in September, 2001 in the U.S. and in
   July, 2005 in London;
 - lower consumer confidence or purchasing associated with rising energy prices;
 - a decline in U.S. spirits consumption as might be indicated by recently
   published trends suggesting a slight reduction in the growth rate of
   distilled spirits consumption;
 - longer-term, a change in consumer preferences, social trends or cultural
   trends that results in the reduced consumption of our premium spirits brands;
 - changes in distribution arrangements in major markets that limit our ability
   to market our products;
 - increases in the price of energy or raw materials, including grapes, grain,
   wood, glass, and plastic;
 - excess wine inventories or a further world-wide oversupply of grapes;
 - adverse developments as a result of state investigations of beverage alcohol
   industry trade practices of suppliers, distributors and retailers.

Diluted  earnings from  continuing  operations for the quarter ended January 31,
2006,  declined 4%, to $0.98 per share,  from $1.02 per share in the prior year,
reflecting  the  absence  of a $0.39 per share gain  recorded  in the prior year
related  to the sale of our shares in  Glenmorangie  plc.  Additionally,  in the
third  quarter of this  fiscal  year we  recorded a $0.14 per share net  benefit
related to changes in our Australian  distribution joint venture and a $0.04 per
share gain on the sale of winery  property.  Quarterly  earning per share growth
was also affected by higher average global trade inventory  levels when compared
to the prior year ($0.05 per share).  Adjusting  for these  factors (as shown in
the following table),  underlying  earnings per share growth for the quarter was
12%,  reflecting  continued  strong  growth in sales and profits for our premium
global brands, most notably Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey.

We have adjusted for items that are  considered to have a significant  effect on
our underlying growth trends, such as acquisitions and dispositions,  changes in
distribution arrangements, foreign exchange, and fluctuations in trade inventory
levels.  We believe  that  disclosing  the  adjusted  growth in EPS enhances the
ability to understand the underlying  growth trends for the company as the items
adjusted have both a disproportionate positive and negative effect on results in
the quarter, making comparisons difficult. In addition, we believe this adjusted
growth rate is a more useful guide in forecasting and planning.

Net  sales and  gross  profit  for the  quarter  grew 5% and 10%,  respectively,
reflecting  continued volume and profit growth for Jack Daniel's,  Fetzer Wines'
profit  growth in the United  States as a result of lower  costs,  and  positive
trends for  Finlandia  (particularly  in central  Europe).  These  factors  were
partially  offset by a stronger  U.S.  dollar  this year  compared  to last year
(negatively  affecting  this year's net sales by $24 million and gross profit by
$11 million) and the absence of sales and gross profit from Glenmorangie and its
family  of  brands,  which  we  formerly  distributed  in the U.S.  and  several
international  markets last year (negatively  affecting this year's net sales by
$4 million and gross profit by $1 million).  Adjusting  for these  factors,  net
sales and gross profit improved 10% and 13%,  respectively.  Management believes
that  disclosing  these rates of growth is  important  because they are a better
indication of the underlying net sales and gross profit growth of the company in
the quarter.

In addition to the 10% increase in reported  gross  profit,  other income was up
significantly  compared to last year,  reflecting  the sale of the winery assets
and  consideration  received  as a result of  changes  in our  Australian  joint
venture  distribution.  These positive  factors were only partially offset by an
11% increase in  advertising  investments  behind our premium  global brands and
higher  investments  in SG&A expenses (6%), due in part to the effect of changes
in our  distribution  network  in a number of markets  around  the  world.  As a
result,  reported operating income grew 41%.  Adjusting  operating income growth
for higher global trade inventory  levels (which boosted  earnings 8%), the sale
of winery assets (which  increased  earnings 4%), the changes in our  Australian
distribution  joint venture  (which added 12% to quarter over quarter  growth in
operating  income),  and the net  effect  of a  couple  of  other  items  (which
contributed  4% growth for the quarter),  operating  income grew at a much lower
rate of 13%.  Management  believes  that  disclosing  this  rate  of  growth  is
important because it is a better  indication of the underlying  operating income
growth of the company in the quarter.

Global  depletions  for our total  portfolio of brands were up in the mid-single
digits in the  quarter  with  balanced  growth  across all  geographies,  led by
strength in many international markets. (Depletions are shipments from wholesale
distributors  to  retailers,  and are commonly  regarded in the wine and spirits
industry as an  approximate  measure of  consumer  demand.)  Depletions  for our
premium  global  brands,  consisting of Jack  Daniel's,  Southern  Comfort,  and
Finlandia,  grew in the high  single  digits and  represent  nearly 60% of total
volumes.  Depletions for our mid-priced regional brands,  which include Canadian
Mist,   Early  Times,   Fetzer  and  Bolla,   were  flat,  while  depletions  of
super-premium  developing brands continued to grow at a double-digit rate in the
quarter.

January  31,  2006,  is  based  on an  expected  effective  tax rate of 32.9% on
ordinary  income for the full  fiscal  year,  less the tax  benefit  achieved by
offsetting various capital gains from continuing  operations against the capital
loss resulting from the sale of Lenox.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

As discussed  earlier,  we consummated the sale of substantially all of Lenox on
September 1, 2005, and we intend to sell Brooks & Bentley.  As a result, we have
reported the operations of Lenox and Brooks & Bentley as discontinued operations
in the  accompanying  financial  statements.  The  net  loss  from  discontinued
operations  during the three  months  ended  January 31,  2006,  consists of the
results  of  operations  for  Brooks & Bentley  as well as fees and other  costs
associated with the Lenox transaction.

For the nine months ended January 31, 2006, earnings from continuing  operations
were up 14% over the prior year. Growth was driven by positive volume trends and
continued margin improvement for our premium global brands.  These improvements,
combined with higher profits from some of our mid-priced  regional  brands (most
notably Fetzer) and volume and profit growth from our  super-premium  developing
brand portfolio,  more than offset increased advertising  investments (primarily
behind premium global brands) and higher SG&A spending.  Adjusting for the items
noted below, underlying earnings per share growth was also 14%.

   *Consists of various items, including lower net interest expense, foreign
    exchange effects, higher incentive compensation in the prior year, and an
    asset impairment associated with the company's minority interest in a small
    Mexican tequila company.

For the  first  nine  months of the  fiscal  year,  net  sales  grew 8%, or $134
million, to approximately $1.9 billion.  Strong year-to-date results in the U.S.
and Europe contributed 75% of the total growth, with the remaining growth coming
from all other international markets.

Gross profit of $1.0 billion was up 12%.  Approximately half of the increase was
driven  by  price  increases,  favorable  mix and  cost  improvements,  with the
remainder  driven by volume  gains,  most  notably for Jack  Daniel's,  Southern
Comfort, and Finlandia.

Healthy  advertising  investments  of $245  million  were up 11%  (and  13% on a
constant dollar basis),  reflecting increased spending in the U.S. and overseas,
while SG&A increased 8%.

In the first nine months of fiscal 2006, Jack Daniel's worldwide depletions grew
in the high single digits. While this growth rate was slightly below that of the
prior year, the brand grew by more than 500,000 cases in the period. Substantial
volume  gains were  registered  in the U.S.,  Asia,  South Africa and nearly all
markets in Europe.  Year-to-date  depletions  for  Southern  Comfort grew in the
mid-single  digits,  driven by the brand's continued progress in the U.S., while
Finlandia  depletions grew at a double-digit rate, propelled by continued strong
growth in Poland and Russia.

The effective tax rate of 30.0% for  continuing  operations  for the nine months
ended January 31, 2006,  is based on an expected  effective tax rate of 32.9% on
ordinary  income for the full  fiscal  year,  less the tax  benefit  achieved by
offsetting various capital gains from continuing  operations against the capital
loss resulting from the sale of Lenox.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

As discussed  earlier,  we consummated the sale of substantially all of Lenox on
September  1,  2005,  and we are  pursuing  the sale of Brooks &  Bentley.  As a
result,  we have  reported  the  operations  of Lenox and  Brooks &  Bentley  as
discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.

   Diluted                                  (0.25)           (0.63)

For the nine  months  ended  January  31,  2006,  we  reported  a net loss  from
discontinued  operations of $77.5 million,  or $0.63 per diluted share, versus a
net loss of $30.0  million  for the same prior year  period.  The loss  recorded
during fiscal 2006 includes a non-cash impairment charge and fees related to the
transaction of approximately $0.57 per share.

EARNINGS OUTLOOK FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS

Based on strong third quarter  results,  we have  increased our fiscal 2006 full
year outlook from continuing operations.  We now expect earnings in the range of
$2.79 to $2.85 per share compared to the previously communicated projected range
of $2.73 to $2.79 per share. Consistent with the previous guidance, this outlook
excludes  (1) the net benefit  from the early  termination  of our  distribution
rights to the  Glenmorangie  family of brands,  (2) the net effect of changes in
our Australian  distribution  joint venture,  and (3) the gain on sale of winery
property in California.  The revised  outlook  compares to prior year's adjusted
earnings per share of $2.42,  which  reflects  prior year  reported  results for
continuing  operations  adjusted  to  exclude  (1)  the  gain  on  the  sale  of
Glenmorangie  shares and (2) trade inventory  reductions related to distribution
changes in Europe.  Neither the current  year outlook nor the prior year results
have been adjusted for any other items, such as foreign exchange, changes in net
interest and effective tax rates, etc.

This  revised full year  guidance  implies a range of earnings  from  continuing
operations  for the  fourth  quarter of $0.48 to $0.54 per  share,  versus  last
year's  adjusted  earnings of $0.54 per share,  reflecting  the  expectation  of
reductions in global trade inventory levels,  incremental brand investments,  an
unfavorable  effect of a stronger U.S.  dollar,  and continued  incremental SG&A
investments in several countries in Europe, Australia, and Japan.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Cash and cash  equivalents  increased  by $71.3  million  during the nine months
ended  January 31, 2006,  compared to an increase of $221.8  million  during the
same  period last year.  Cash  provided by  operations  declined  from $342.0 to
$243.4  million,  primarily  reflecting a $67.3  million  reduction in cash from
discontinued  operations in addition to higher working  capital  requirements in
continuing  operations.  Cash used for investing  activities  increased by $65.4
million,  as we  invested  a portion of our cash into  higher  interest-yielding
short-term  investments.  Cash used for financing  activities  declined by $13.5
million, largely reflecting lower debt repayments and higher proceeds from stock
option exercises, partially offset by higher dividend payments.

The American Jobs  Creation Act ("the Act"),  which was enacted in October 2004,
would allow  Brown-Forman a special one-time  opportunity to repatriate  certain
foreign  earnings  before April 30, 2006,  at a 5.25%  effective  tax rate.  The
opportunity is subject to a number of limitations  and  requirements,  including
adoption of a specific domestic  reinvestment plan for the repatriated funds. We
have not yet repatriated any dividends  pursuant to the Act, but are considering
the  opportunity  and will decide  whether to do so during the fourth quarter of
this fiscal year.

Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We hold debt  obligations,  foreign currency forward and option  contracts,  and
commodity  futures  contracts  that are exposed to risk from changes in interest
rates,  foreign  currency  exchange rates, and commodity  prices,  respectively.
Established  procedures  and internal  processes  govern the management of these
market  risks.  As of January 31, 2006, we do not consider the exposure to these
market risks to be material.

Item 4.   Controls and Procedures

The Chief Executive  Officer ("CEO") and the Chief Financial  Officer ("CFO") of
Brown-Forman  (its principal  executive and principal  financial  officers) have
evaluated  the   effectiveness  of  the  company's   "disclosure   controls  and
procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)  under the Securities  Exchange Act of
1934 (the  "Exchange  Act")) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based  on  that  evaluation,  the  CEO  and CFO  concluded  that  the  company's
disclosure  controls and  procedures:  are effective to ensure that  information
required to be disclosed by the company in the reports  filed or submitted by it
under the Exchange Act is recorded,  processed,  summarized, and reported within
the time periods  specified in the SEC's rules and forms;  and include  controls
and procedures  designed to ensure that information  required to be disclosed by
the company in such reports is  accumulated  and  communicated  to the company's
management,  including  the CEO and the CFO,  as  appropriate,  to allow  timely
decisions  regarding  required  disclosure.  There  has  been no  change  in the
company's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  during the most recent
fiscal  quarter  that  has  materially  affected,  or is  reasonably  likely  to
materially affect, the company's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.   Legal Proceedings

Brown-Forman Corporation and many other manufacturers of spirits, wine, and beer
are defendants in a series of essentially  similar class action lawsuits seeking
damages and  injunctive  relief for  alleged  marketing  of beverage  alcohol to
underage  consumers.  Nine  lawsuits  have been filed to date,  the first  three
against  eight  defendants,  including  Brown-Forman:  "Hakki  v.  Adolph  Coors
Company,  et.al.,"  District of Columbia Superior Court No. CD 03-9183 (November
2003);  "Kreft v. Zima Beverage Co., et.al.," District Court,  Jefferson County,
Colorado,  No. 04cv1827  (December 2003); and "Wilson v. Zima Company,  et.al.,"
U.S.  District  Court for the  Western  District  of North  Carolina,  Charlotte
Division,  No.  3:04cv141 ( January 2004).  Two virtually  identical  suits with
allegations  similar  to  those  in the  first  three  lawsuits  were  filed  in
Cleveland,  Ohio, in April and June,  2004,  respectively,  against the original
eight  defendants as well as an  additional  nine  manufacturers  of spirits and
beer, and are now consolidated as "Eisenberg v.  Anheuser-Busch,"  U.S. District
Court for the District of Northern Ohio, No. 1:04cv1081. Five similar suits were
filed in 2005: "Elizabeth H. Sciocchette v. Advanced Brands," Albany County, New
York Supreme Court No. 102205 (February 16, 2005); "Roger and Kathy Bertovich v.
Advanced  Brands,"  Hancock  County,  West Virginia,  Circuit Court No. 05-C-42M
(February  17,  2005);  "Jacquelin  Tomberlin  v.  Adolph  Coors,"  Dane  County
(Madison,  Wisconsin)  Circuit  Court,  (February  23,  2005);  "Viola Alston v.
Advanced Brands," Wayne County, Michigan,  Circuit Court No. 05-509294,  (March,
30, 2005), and "Craig Konhauzer v. Adolph Coors Company," Broward County Florida
Circuit Court, No. 05004875 (March 30, 2005). In addition, Brown-Forman received
in February, 2004, a pre-lawsuit notice under the California Consumer Protection
Act indicating that the same lawyers intend to file a lawsuit there against many
industry defendants,  including  Brown-Forman,  presumably on the same facts and
legal theories.

The suits  allege  that the  defendants  have  engaged  in  deceptive  marketing
practices and schemes targeted at underage consumers, negligently marketed their
products to the underage, and fraudulently concealed their alleged misconduct.

Plaintiffs  seek class action  certification  on behalf of: (a) a guardian class
consisting  of all persons who were or are parents of children  whose funds were
used to purchase beverage alcohol marketed by the defendants which were consumed
without their prior  knowledge by their  children under the age of 21 during the
period 1982 to present;  and (b) an injunctive  class  consisting of the parents
and guardians of all children currently under the age of 21.

The lawsuits seek: (1) a finding that defendants  engaged in a deceptive  scheme
to market alcoholic beverages to underage persons and an injunction against such
alleged  practices;  (2)  disgorgement  and refund to the guardian  class of all
proceeds  resulting  from sales to the underage  since 1982; and (3) judgment to
each  guardian  class  member for a trebled  award of actual  damages,  punitive
damages, and attorneys fees. The lawsuits,  either collectively or individually,
if ultimately successful, represent significant financial exposure.

                                       21

Brown-Forman,  in coordination  with other defendants,  is vigorously  defending
itself in these cases.  Brown-Forman and the other defendants have  successfully
obtained  orders to dismiss three of the pending  cases:  "Kreft"  (Colorado) in
December 2005;  "Eisenberg" (Ohio) in January 2006; and "Tomberlin"  (Wisconsin)
in February 2006. In addition,  plaintiff  Konhauzer  (Florida) has  voluntarily
dismissed that lawsuit.  Plaintiffs  Kreft  (Colorado) and Eisenberg (Ohio) have
appealed the dismissal of their cases and plaintiff Tomberlin  (Wisconsin) still
has time in which to file an appeal.

       CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002

I, Paul C. Varga, certify that:

1.  I have reviewed this Quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Brown-Forman
    Corporation;

2.  Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
    a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the

    registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

4.  The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for
    establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
    in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over
    financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and
    15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:

    a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
        disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
        to ensure that material information relating to the registrant,
        including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others
        within those entities, particularly during the period in which this
        report is being prepared;

    b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such
        internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our

        likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over
        financial reporting; and

5.  The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our
    most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the

        operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
        reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to

    b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
        employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal

Exhibit 31.2

       CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002

I, Phoebe A. Wood, certify that:

1.  I have reviewed this Quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Brown-Forman
    Corporation;

2.  Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
    a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
    statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
    were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

3.  Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
    information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects
    the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the
    registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

4.  The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for
    establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
    in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over
    financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and
    15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:

    a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
        disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
        to ensure that material information relating to the registrant,
        including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others
        within those entities, particularly during the period in which this
        report is being prepared;

    b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such
        internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our
        supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
        of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
        external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
        principles;

    c)  Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and
        procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
        effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end
        of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

    d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control
        over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most
        recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the
        case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably
        likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over
        financial reporting; and

5.  The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our
    most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the
    registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
    directors (or persons performing the equivalent function):

    a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
        operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
        reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
        record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

    b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
        employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
        control over financial reporting.
