Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

January 31, 2006 

1. 
       
      Basis of presentation . The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and
Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial
statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating
results for the quarter ended January 31, 2006 are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be expected for the full fiscal year. For further information, refer to
the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s
annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 30, 2005. Certain prior period
amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. 

2. 
       
      Basis of Consolidation.  The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Prior to 2006, the majority of the Company s international operations reported their results
on a one-month lag, in order to facilitate reporting of consolidated accounts. Effective in
2006, the reporting lag was eliminated. As a result, the October 2005 results of operations
for these subsidiaries, which amounted to a net loss of $788,000, were recorded directly to
retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal 2006. Beginning in 2006, each accounting
period ends on the calendar month-end. Previously, each month ended on a Sunday. 

3. 
       
      Revenue recognition . Most of the Company s revenues are
recognized upon shipment, provided that persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable,
collectibility is reasonably assured, and title and risk of loss have
passed to the customer. Revenues from contracts with multiple
element arrangements, such as those including installation or other
services, are  recognized as each element is earned based on
objective evidence of the relative fair value of each element. If the
installation or other services are inconsequential to the
functionality of the delivered product, the entire amount of revenue
is recognized upon transfer of ownership. Inconsequential installation
of other services are those which can generally be completed in a
short period of time, at insignificant cost, and the skills required
to  complete these installations are not unique to the
Company. If installation or other services are essential to the functionality of the delivered product, revenues attributable to these obligations are deferred until
completed. Amounts received in excess of revenue recognized are
included as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets.
A limited
number of the Company s large engineered systems sales contracts are
accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method. The amount
of revenue recognized in any accounting period is based on the ratio
of actual costs incurred through the end of the period to total
estimated costs at completion. Cost estimates are updated on a
quarterly basis. The remaining  revenues are  recognized  upon
delivery. 

4. 
       
      Use of estimates . The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.
Actual amounts could differ from these estimates. 

5. 
       
      Accounting Changes . In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 151,  Inventory Costs.  No. 151 amends Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4,  Inventory Pricing,  to clarify the accounting for abnormal
amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material. This
Statement requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges and requires
that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the
normal capacity of the production facilities. The Company adopted No. 151 in fiscal 2006,
and the adoption did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

Nordson Corporation 

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123
(revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. This Statement replaces FASB Statement No. 123 and
supercedes APB Opinion No. 25. No. 123(R) eliminates the ability to account for share-based
compensation transactions using the intrinsic method currently used by the Company. No.
123(R) requires such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method that
would result in expense being recognized in the Company s financial statements. As
discussed in Note 9, the Company adopted No. 123(R) in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. 

In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47,  Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations.  This interpretation states that the term  conditional asset
retirement obligation  as used in paragraph A23 of SFAS No. 143 refers to a legal obligation
to perform an asset retirement in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are
conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The
obligation to perform the asset retirement obligation is unconditional even though
uncertainty exists about the timing and (or) method of settlement. The effective date for
adopting this interpretation is no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December
15, 2005. The Company has not yet determined the impact of adoption on its consolidated
financial position or results of operations. 

In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 154,
 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.  No. 154 replaces Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 20,  Accounting Changes  and FASB Statement No. 3,  Reporting Accounting Changes
in Interim Financial Statements,  and changes the accounting for and reporting of a change
in accounting principle. The Statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting
principle and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement when specific transition
provisions are not provided. The Statement requires retrospective application to prior
periods  financial statements for changes in accounting principle, unless it is
impracticable to determine the period specific or cumulative effect of the change. The
Statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2005.

      Stock-Based Compensation.  The Company s long-term performance plan, approved
by the Company s shareholders in 2004, provides for the granting of stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock purchase rights, stock equivalent units, cash
awards and other stock or performance-based incentives. The number of Common Shares
available for grant of awards is 3.0 percent of the number of Common Shares outstanding as
of the first day of each fiscal year, plus up to an additional 0.5 percent, consisting of shares available, but not granted, in prior years. 

Stock Options  

Nonqualified or incentive stock options may be granted to employees and directors of the
Company. Generally, options granted to employees may be exercised beginning one year from
the date of grant at a rate not exceeding 25 percent per year and expire 10 years from the
date of grant. Options granted to non-employee directors vest in 6 months. Vesting
accelerates upon the occurrence of events that involve or may result in a change of control
of the Company. Option exercises are satisfied through the issuance of treasury shares on a
first-in first-out basis. 

Prior to 2006, the Company accounted for its stock options under the recognition and
measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. 
No stock option expense was reflected in net income, as all options granted under these
plans had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying Common Shares
on the date of grant. Effective at the beginning of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted the
fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123 (R) using the modified prospective transition
method. Under this method compensation cost in 2006 includes cost for options
granted prior to but not vested as of October 31, 2005 and options granted in fiscal 2006.
Compensation expense is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the total requisite
service period of each option grant. Results for prior periods have not been restated.

Nordson Corporation 

The following table shows pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share
for the first quarter of 2005 as if the Company had accounted for stock options granted
since 1996 under the fair value method.

As a result of adopting FAS 123 (R), the Company recognized compensation expense of $982,000
($639,000 on an after-tax basis, or $.02 per both basic and diluted share) during the first
quarter of 2006.

Prior to the adoption of FAS 123 (R), the Company presented the tax benefit of deductions
resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the Statement of
Cash Flows. FAS 123 (R) requires these benefits to be classified as financing cash flows.
The excess tax benefit of $3,549,000 in the first quarter of 2006 was classified as a
financing cash inflow and would have been classified as an operating cash flow prior to
adoption of FAS 123 (R).

Following is a summary of the Company s stock options for the quarter ending January 31,
2006:

Page 10

Table of Contents   

Nordson Corporation 

As of January 31, 2006, there was $8,245,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related
to nonvested stock options. That cost is expected to be amortized over a weighted average
period of approximately 1.6 years.

The fair value of each option grant was estimated at the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

The weighted-average expected volatility and weighted-average expected dividend yield used
to value the 2006 options were .278 and 1.92%, respectively.

Historical information was the primary basis for the selection of the expected volatility,
expected dividend yield and the expected lives of the options. The risk-free interest rate
was selected based upon yields of U.S. Treasury issues with a term equal to the expected
life of the option being valued.

The weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted during the first three
months of 2006 and 2005 was $11.81 and $12.08, respectively. The total intrinsic value of
options exercised during the first three months of 2006 and 2005 was $12,501,000 and
$3,087,000, respectively.

Cash received from the exercise of stock options was $12,352,000 for the first quarter of
2006 and $2,239,000 for the first quarter of 2005. The tax benefit realized from tax
deductions from exercises was $3,549,000 for the first quarter of 2006 and $55,000 for the
first quarter of 2005. The tax benefit increased because of a higher amount of compensation
expense related to stock option exercises. In addition, the benefit increased because a
higher tax rate was applied to the expense. In the first quarter of 2005, the amount of the
benefit could not be determined, so a minimum tax rate was used. This year, it is expected
that the Company will be able to utilize more of the benefit to reduce income taxes, so a
statutory tax rate was used.

Restricted Stock 

The Company may grant restricted stock to employees and directors of the Company. These shares may not be disposed of for a designated period of time (currently six months to five
years) defined at the date of grant and are to be returned to the Company if the recipient s
employment terminates during the restriction period. As shares are issued, deferred
stock-based compensation equivalent to the fair market value on the date of grant is charged
to shareholders  equity and subsequently amortized over the restriction period. Tax
benefits arising from the lapse of restrictions on the stock are recognized when realized
and credited to capital in excess of stated value. Upon adoption of
FAS 123(R) at the  beginning of 2006, the unamortized balance of the
deferred stock-based compensation was reclassified to capital in
excess of stated value.

The following table summarizes activity related to restricted stock during the first quarter
of 2006:

Page 11

Table of Contents   

Nordson Corporation 

As of January 31, 2006, there was approximately $2,577,000 of unrecognized compensation cost
related to restricted stock. The cost is expected to be amortized over a weighted average
period of 1.8 years. The amount charged to expense related to restricted stock was $458,000
in the first quarter of 2006 and $427,000 in the first quarter of 2005.

Directors Deferred Compensation 

Non-employee directors may defer all or part of their fees until retirement. The fees may
be deferred as cash or as stock equivalent units. Deferred cash amounts are recorded as
liabilities. Upon adoption of FAS 123 (R) at the beginning of 2006, deferred amounts of
$3,435,000 in stock equivalent units were reclassified from liabilities to capital in excess
of stated value. Additional stock equivalent units are earned when common stock dividends
are declared.

The following is a summary of the activity during the first quarter of 2006:

The amount charged to expense related to this plan was $80,000 in the first quarter of 2006.

Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (LTIP) 

Under the long-term incentive compensation plan, executive officers and selected other
employees receive cash or stock awards based solely on corporate performance measures over
three-year performance periods. Awards vary based on the degree to which corporate
performance exceeds predetermined threshold, target and maximum performance levels at the
end of a performance period. No payout will occur unless the Company exceeds certain
threshold performance objectives.

Under the performance periods originating in 2004 and 2005, awards will be paid in cash
based upon the share price of the Company s Common Shares at a predetermined date subsequent
to the end of each three-year performance period. Over each three-year performance period,
costs are accrued based upon current performance projections for the three-year period and
the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered, along with changes in value
of the Company s Common Shares. The method of estimating accrual amounts was revised upon
adoption of FAS 123 (R), however the cumulative effect of the change was not material. The
accruals for these performance periods continue to be classified as liabilities.

Under the performance period originating in 2006, awards will be settled in Common Shares.
The amount of compensation expense is based upon current performance projections for the
three-year period and the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered. The
calculation is also based upon the
weighted-average value of the Company s Common Stock at the dates of grant ($36.97 per
share). These awards are recorded in shareholders  equity, and the amount recorded at
January 31, 2006 was $315,000.

10. 
      Warranty Accrual.  The Company offers warranty to its customers depending on
the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement. Most of the Company s
product warranties are customer specific. A typical warranty program requires that the
Company repair or replace defective products within a specified time period from the date
of delivery or first use. The Company records an estimate for future warranty-related
costs based on actual historical return rates. Based on analysis of return rates and other
factors, the adequacy of the Company s warranty provisions are adjusted as necessary. The
liability for warranty costs is included in other current liabilities in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. 

Following is a reconciliation of the product warranty liability for the first quarter of
2006 and 2005: 

11. 
      Non-recurring charges . During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company
announced a number of restructuring actions to improve performance and reduce costs in its
finishing and coating segment. These actions, which include operational consolidations and
approximately 60 personnel reductions, will be substantially completed by the end of the
second quarter of fiscal 2006. As a result of these actions, resources will be more
effectively aligned with shifting patterns of global demands, enabling the segment to
operate both with lower costs and better capability to serve customers in the faster
growing emerging markets. The Company expects that total restructuring costs will be
approximately $3,200,000, of which $875,000 was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 and
$1,233,000 was recorded in the first quarter of 2006. Substantially all of the $3,200,000
of expense is associated with cash expenditures for severance payments to terminated
employees. The following table summarizes activity in the severance and restructuring
accrual during 2006: 

12. 
      Operating segments . The Company conducts business across three primary
business segments: adhesive dispensing and nonwoven fiber systems, advanced technology
systems and finishing and coating systems. The composition of segments and measure of
segment profitability is consistent with that used by the Company s chief operating
decision maker. The primary focus is operating profit, which equals sales less operating
costs and expenses. Operating profit excludes interest income (expense), investment income
(net) and other income (expense). Items below the operating income line of the Condensed
Consolidated
Statement of Income are not presented by segment, since they are excluded from the measure
of segment profitability reviewed by the Company s chief operating decision maker. The
accounting policies of the segments are generally the same as those described in Note 1,
Significant Accounting Policies, of the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year
ended October 30, 2005.

      Pension and other postretirement plans.  The components of net periodic pension
cost and the cost of other postretirement benefits for 2006 as compared with 2005 were: 

The Company s contributions to pension and postretirement plans in fiscal 2006 is now
estimated to be approximately $21.5 million, compared to the previous estimate of $14
million disclosed in the Company s 2005 10-K. 

14. 
       
      Contingencies  .  The Company is involved in pending or potential litigation
regarding environmental, product liability, patent, contract, employee and other matters
arising from the normal course of business. Including the environmental matter discussed
below, it is the Company s opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, that resolutions
of these matters are not expected to result in a material effect on its financial
condition, operating results, or cash flows. 

Environmental   The Company has voluntarily agreed with the City of New Richmond, Wisconsin
and other Potentially Responsible Parties to share costs associated with (1) a feasibility
study and remedial investigation ( FS/RI ) for the City of New Richmond municipal landfill
and (2) providing clean drinking water to the affected down gradient residential properties
through completion of the FS/RI phase of the project. The FS/RI is expected to be
completed in fiscal 2006. The Company has committed $1,079,000 towards completing the FS/RI
phase of the project and providing clean drinking water. This amount has been recorded in
the Company s financial statements in selling and administrative expenses. Against this
commitment, the Company has made payments of $922,000 through the first quarter of 2006.
The remaining amount of $157,000 is recorded in other current liabilities in the January 31,
2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The total cost of the Company s share for remediation
efforts will not be ascertainable until the FS/RI is completed and a remediation plan is
approved by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, which is anticipated to occur
later in fiscal 2006. However, based upon current information, the Company does not expect
that the costs associated with remediation will have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition or results of operations. 

The European Union ( EU ) has adopted two Directives to facilitate the recycling of
electrical and electronic equipment sold in the EU. The first of these is the Waste
Electrical and Electronic Equipment ( WEEE ) Directive which directs EU Member States to
enact laws, regulations, and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of
electrical and electronic equipment provide for the financing of the collection, treatment,
recovery and environmentally sound disposal of WEEE from products placed on the market after
August 13, 2005 and from products in use prior to that date that are being replaced. In
accordance with the WEEE directive, the Company has identified and labeled its products that
are affected by the regulations adopted by Member States. The Company also has developed a
strategy to support recycling of the electrical and electronic equipment and has created a
section on its Website to provide customers with information on how to return WEEE-labeled
products for proper recycling.

The second of these Directives is the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances
in Electrical and Electronic Equipment ( RoHS ) Directive. The RoHS Directive addresses the
restriction on use of certain hazardous substances such as mercury, lead, cadmium, and
hexavalent cadmium in electrical and electronic equipment placed on the market after July 1,
2006. The Company has committed to design its future products to meet the standards
established by the RoHS Directive. 

As of January 31, 2006, EU Member States continue to develop legislation to implement these
Directives. Costs incurred in the first quarter of 2006 were not material, but the future
cost to the Company to comply with the Directives and Member States  legislation will not be
quantifiable until Member States have fully implemented the Directives. 

15. 
       
      Guarantees.  The Company has issued guarantees to two banks to support the
short-term borrowing facilities of a 49 percent-owned South Korean joint
venture/distributor of the Company s products. One guarantee is for Korean Won Three
Billion (approximately $3,125,000) secured by land and building and expires on January 31,
2007. The other is a continuing guarantee for $3,300,000. 

In 2004, the Company issued a guarantee to a U.S. bank related to a five-year trade
financing agreement for a sale to a customer in Turkey. The loan is secured by collateral
with a current value well in excess of the amount due. The guarantee would be triggered
upon a payment default by the customer to the bank. The amount of the guarantee at January
31, 2006 was Euro 1,800,000 (approximately $2,187,000) and is declining ratably as
semi-annual principal payments are made by the customer. The Company has recorded
$1,045,000 in other current liabilities related to this guarantee. The recorded amount is
being reduced as the customer makes payments.

The following is Management s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors
affecting the Company s financial condition and results of operations for the periods
included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Results of Operations  

Sales   

Worldwide sales for the first quarter of 2006 were $197.5 million, a 3.8% increase from
sales of $190.2 million for the comparable period of 2005. A sales volume increase of 7.2%
was partially offset by a decrease of 3.4% due to the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar in
2006. 

Sales of the Company s adhesive dispensing segment decreased 1.2% in 2006 from 2005. Volume
gains of 3.1% were more than offset by currency effects that reduced sales by 4.3%.
Increased sales volume in the packaging, coating and product assembly businesses was
partially offset by lower fiber system sales. Advanced technology segment sales were up
23.0% from 2005. The increase can be traced to a volume increase of 24.3%, offset by 1.3%
from currency effects. Sales volume for each of the businesses in this segment was up more
than 13%. Sales of the finishing and coating segment were down 3.0% from the prior year,
mainly due to the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar. Sales volume for this segment was
even with 2005, with higher liquid and container sales reduced by lower powder sales. 

On a geographic basis, first quarter sales volume was up 9.8% in the United States, 5.3% in
the Americas, 6.3% in Europe and 14.2% in the Asia Pacific region. These increases were
partially offset by a sales volume decrease of 3.7% in Japan resulting from lower powder
system sales.

Operating Profit  

The first quarter gross margin percentage was 57.6% in 2006 compared to 56.0% in 2005. The
increase was driven by favorable product mix and productivity improvements, particularly in
the Adhesive segment. Unfavorable currency effects reduced the gross margin rate by .4%.

Selling and administrative expenses in 2006 were up $1,577,000, or 1.9%, from 2005.
Effective in fiscal 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of FAS
123 (R) using the modified prospective transition method, resulting in $982,000 of stock
option expense. Under the modified prospective transition method, compensation cost in 2006
includes cost for options granted prior to but not vested as of October 31, 2005 and options
granted in fiscal 2006. Compensation expense is being recognized on a straight-line basis
over the total requisite service period of each option grant. Prior to 2006, the Company
accounted for its stock options under the recognition and measurement principles of APB
Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.  No stock option expense was
reflected in net income, as all options granted under these plans had an exercise price
equal to the fair market value of the underlying Common Shares on the date of grant.
Results for prior periods have not been restated. The adoption of FAS 123(R) is expected to
reduce quarterly earnings per share by approximately $.02 per share in 2006.

Compensation increases and higher employee benefit costs also contributed to the increase in
selling and administrative expenses. Currency translation effects reduced selling and
administrative costs by 2.6%. Expenses as a percent of sales decreased to 42.7% in 2006
from 43.5% for the first quarter of 2005.

Operating profit, as a percentage of sales, was 14.3% in the first quarter of 2006, up from
12.5% in 2005. Operating profit, as a percent of sales, for the Adhesive segment increased
from 16.0% in 2005 to 19.0% in 2006, primarily due to higher gross margins driven by
favorable product mix and productivity improvements. For the Advanced Technology segment,
operating profit as a percent of sales increased from 16.5% in 2005 to 21.6% in 2006,
primarily due to operating costs increasing at a slower rate than revenue. The operating
loss in the Finishing and Coating segment was due to severance and restructuring costs of
$1,233,000 recorded in the first quarter.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company announced a number of restructuring actions
to improve performance and reduce costs in its finishing and coating segment. These
actions, which include operational consolidations and approximately 60 personnel reductions,
will be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2006. As a
result of these actions, resources will be more effectively aligned with shifting patterns
of global demands, enabling the segment to operate both with lower costs and better
capability to serve customers in the faster growing emerging markets. The Company expects
that total restructuring costs will be approximately $3,200,000 of which $875,000 was
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 and $1,233,000 was recorded in the first quarter of
2006.

Net Income  

Foreign exchange losses were largely responsible for other expense of $707,000 in 2006.
This compares to other income of $483,000 in 2005, when foreign exchange gains were
generated.

The Company s effective tax rate was 33.6% in the first quarter of 2006, up from 32.5% in
the first quarter of 2005. The change was primarily due to a reduction to the
extraterritorial income exclusion in 2006.

Net income for the first quarter of 2006 was $16.1 million, or $.47 per share on a diluted
basis, compared to $14.4 million or $.39 per share on a diluted basis in 2005. This
represents a 12% increase in net income and a 21% increase in earnings per share. The
higher per share increase is due to the repurchase of approximately 10% of the Company s
outstanding common shares in the fourth quarter of 2005.

Foreign Currency Effects  

In the aggregate, average exchange rates for the first quarter of 2006 used to translate
international sales and operating results into U.S. dollars compared unfavorably with
average exchange rates existing during the comparable 2005 period. It is not possible to
precisely measure the impact on operating results arising from foreign currency exchange
rate changes, because of changes in selling prices, sales volume, product mix and cost
structure in each country in which the Company operates. However, if transactions for the
first quarter 2006 were translated at exchange rates in effect during the first quarter of
2005, sales would have been approximately $6.4 million higher while third-party costs and
expenses would have been approximately $4.1 million higher.

Financial Condition 

Cash and cash equivalents increased $6.5 million in the first quarter of 2006. Cash
provided by operations was $15.3 million, and cash generated by the exercise of stock
options was $12.4 million. Cash was used for dividend payments of $5.5 million, repayment
of short-term borrowings and long-term debt of $13.1 million, and for capital expenditures
of $4.5 million. Available lines of credit continue to be adequate to meet additional cash
requirements over the next year.

Receivables and accounts payable decreased and inventories increased as a result of the
traditionally lower level of business activity in the Company s first fiscal quarter
compared to its fourth fiscal quarter. The increase in prepaid expenses relates largely to
annual insurance premiums paid in the first quarter of the year. Other current liabilities
decreased as a result of bonus and profit sharing payments during the first quarter. The
decrease was offset by a reclassification of a portion of the pension liability from other
long-term liabilities to other current liabilities.

Cash provided by operations in the first quarter of 2006 was up $7.6 million from the first
quarter of 2005. The increase was primarily due to the impact of changes in working
capital. The overall increase in cash and cash equivalents in 2006 was less than 2005, due
to the sale of marketable securities in the first quarter of 2005.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The Company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The
preparation of these financial statements requires the Company s management to make
estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates the accounting policies
and estimates it uses to prepare financial statements. The Company bases its estimates on
historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and
circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by
management.

Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed
critical to the Company s results of operations or financial position were discussed in Item
7 of the 10-K for the year ended October 30, 2005. During the first quarter of 2006 there
were no material changes in these policies.

Outlook 

Sales volume for the second quarter of 2006 is expected to increase 11% to 13% compared to
the second quarter of 2005. The effect of the stronger U.S. dollar should reduce reported
sales by about 4%, resulting in a 7% to 9% increase in sales. The increase reflects
continued strength in the advanced technology segment. Gross margins for the second quarter
are estimated to be 55% to 56%, approximately equal to 2005. Operating expenses should
increase approximately 5%, including the effect of stock option expense and restructuring
charges related to the Finishing segment. Earnings per share are expected to be in the
range of $.55 to $.60 for the quarter.

Safe Harbor Statements Under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act Of 1995 

The statements in the paragraphs titled  Financial Condition  and  Outlook  that refer to
anticipated trends, events or occurrences in, or expectations for, the future (generally
indicated by the use of phrases such as  Nordson expects  or  Nordson believes  or words of
similar import or by references to  risks ) are  forward-looking statements  intended to
qualify for the protection afforded by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and involve risks and
uncertainties. Consequently, the Company s actual results could differ materially from the
expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause the
Company s actual results to differ materially from the expected results include, but are not
limited to: deferral of orders, customer-requested delays in system installations, currency
exchange rate fluctuations, a sales mix different from assumptions and significant changes
in local business conditions in geographic regions in which the Company conducts business.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Information regarding the Company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes
in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates was disclosed in Form 10-K filed by
the Company on January 13, 2006. The information disclosed has not changed materially in
the interim period since October 30, 2005.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

The Company s management with the participation of its principal executive officer
(Chairman and Chief Executive Officer) and principal financial officer (President, Chief
Financial and Administrative Officer), has reviewed and evaluated the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15e) as of
January 31, 2006. Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including its
principal executive and financial officers, has concluded that the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of January 31, 2006 in ensuring that information
required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to
the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

There were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that
occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2006 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial
reporting.

Part II   Other Information 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

The Company has voluntarily agreed with the City of New Richmond, Wisconsin and other
Potentially Responsible Parties to share costs associated with (1) a feasibility study and
remedial investigation ( FS/RI ) for the City of New Richmond municipal landfill and (2)
providing clean drinking water to the affected down gradient residential properties through
completion of the FS/RI phase of the project. The FS/RI is expected to be completed in
fiscal 2006. The Company has committed $1,079,000 towards completing the FS/RI phase of the
project and providing clean drinking water. This amount has been recorded in the Company s
financial statements in selling and administrative expenses. Against this commitment, the
Company has made payments of $922,000 through the first quarter of 2006. The remaining
amount of $157,000 is recorded in other current liabilities in the January 31, 2006
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The total cost of the Company s share for remediation efforts
will not be ascertainable until the FS/RI is completed and a remediation plan is approved by
the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, which is anticipated to occur later in fiscal
2006. However, based upon current information, the Company does not expect that the costs
associated with remediation will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition
or results of operations.

The European Union ( EU ) has adopted two Directives to facilitate the recycling of
electrical and electronic equipment sold in the EU. The first of these is the Waste
Electrical and Electronic Equipment ( WEEE ) Directive which directs EU Member States to
enact laws, regulations, and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of
electrical and electronic equipment provide for the financing of the collection, treatment,
recovery and environmentally sound disposal of WEEE from products placed on the market after
August 13, 2005 and from products in use prior to that date that are being replaced. In
accordance with the WEEE directive, the Company has identified and labeled its products that
are affected by the regulations adopted by Member States. The Company also has developed a
strategy to support recycling of the electrical and electronic equipment and has created a
section on its Website to provide customers with information on how to return WEEE-labeled
products for proper recycling.

The second of these Directives is the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances
in Electrical and Electronic Equipment ( RoHS ) Directive. The RoHS Directive addresses the
restriction on use of certain hazardous substances such as mercury, lead, cadmium, and
hexavalent cadmium in electrical and electronic equipment placed on the market after July 1,
2006. The Company has committed to design its future products to meet the standards
established by the RoHS Directive.

As of January 31, 2006, EU Member States continue to develop legislation to implement these
Directives. Costs incurred in the first quarter of 2006 were not material, but the future
cost to the Company to comply with the Directives and Member States  legislation will not be
quantifiable until Member States have fully implemented the Directives.

In addition, the Company is involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the
normal course of business. Based on current information, the Company does not expect that
the ultimate resolution of pending and threatened legal proceedings, including the
environmental matter described above, will have a material adverse effect on its financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

In October 2003, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to two
million shares of the Company s common stock on the open market. Expected uses for
repurchased shares include the funding of benefit programs including stock options,
restricted stock and 401(k) matching. Shares purchased will be treated as treasury shares
until used for such purposes. The repurchase program will be funded using the Company s
working capital. During the first quarter of 2006, no shares were purchased under this
program or otherwise. There are 1,772,000 shares that may yet be purchased under this
program.
