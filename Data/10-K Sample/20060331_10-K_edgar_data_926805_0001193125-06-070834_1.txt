PART I        
  Item 1. Business        General       Diversified Futures Trust I (the  Registrant  or the  Trust ), a Delaware business Trust, was organized under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act on May 18, 1994 and will terminate on December 31, 2020 unless
terminated sooner under the provisions of the Second Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement (the  Trust Agreement ). The Registrant s trustee is Wilmington Trust Company. The Registrant was formed to engage in
the speculative trading of commodity futures and forward contracts. The Registrant s fiscal year for book and tax purposes ends on December 31.      On January 5, 1995, the Registrant completed its initial offering having raised $25,262,800 from the sale of 249,628 limited interests ( Limited Interests ) and 3,000 general interests ( General Interests )
(collectively, the  Interests ) and commenced operations. Following the close of the initial offering period, additional Interests were offered and sold monthly at their month-end net asset value ( NAV ) per Interest during a
continuous offering period ( Continuous Offering Period ) which expired on August 31, 1996. Additional contributions raised during the Continuous Offering Period resulted in additional proceeds to the Registrant of $41,129,100 from
the sale of 299,640 Limited Interests and 1,628 General Interests. General Interests were sold exclusively to the managing owner.      The Registrant is
engaged solely in the business of commodity futures and forward trading; therefore, presentation of industry segment information is not applicable.      On
July 1, 2003, Prudential Financial, Inc. ( Prudential ) and Wachovia Corp. ( Wachovia ) combined their separate retail securities brokerage and clearing businesses under a new holding company named Wachovia/Prudential
Financial Advisors, LLC ( WPFA  owned 62% by Wachovia and 38% by Prudential. As a result, the retail brokerage operations of Prudential Securities Incorporated ( PSI ) were contributed to Wachovia Securities, LLC
( Wachovia Securities ). Wachovia Securities is wholly-owned by WPFA and is a registered broker-dealer and a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ( NASD ) and all major securities exchanges. The
Registrant and its Managing Owner, Prudential Securities Futures Management Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PSI, entered into a service agreement with Wachovia Securities, effective July 1, 2003. Pursuant to this agreement, Wachovia
Securities agreed to provide certain enumerated services to accounts of the limited interest owners carried at Wachovia.      Effective July 1, 2003, PSI
changed its name to Prudential Equity Group, Inc. ( PEG ). PEG remained an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential. PEG was a registered broker-dealer and a member of the NASD and all major securities exchanges and conducted the
equity research, domestic and international equity sales and trading operations, and commodity brokerage and derivative operations it had previously conducted as PSI until December 31, 2003. As part of the process of reorganizing its business
structure, Prudential Securities Group Inc. ( PSG ), the direct parent of PEG and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential, transferred the commodity brokerage, commodity clearing and derivative operations previously performed by PEG to
another PSG indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary, Prudential Financial Derivatives, LLC ( PFD ) effective January 1, 2004. Like PEG, PFD is registered as a futures commission merchant under the Commodity Exchange Act and is a member of
the National Futures Association. On April 1, 2004 PEG transferred the ownership of the Managing Owner and PFD Holdings, LLC, the direct parent of PFD to PSG.      On June 30, 2004, PSG and Preferred Investment Solutions Corp., formerly Kenmar Advisory Corp. ( Preferred ), entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which PSG would sell, and Preferred would buy, all of the
capital stock of Prudential Securities Futures Management Inc. (the then current Managing Owner of the Registrant) and another commodity pool operator owned by PSG. In connection with the transaction, Prudential Securities Futures Management Inc.
solicited proxies seeking approval from the Registrant s interest holders for (i) the sale of the stock of Prudential Securities Futures Management Inc. to Preferred; (ii) the concomitant approval of Preferred as the new Managing
Owner of the Registrant; and (iii) the approval of certain amendments to the Declaration of the Trust and Trust Agreement of the Trust. A Report on Form 8-K describing the transaction was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
July 1, 2004 and the definitive proxies were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 20, 2004.      As of October 1, 2004,
Preferred acquired from PSG all of the outstanding stock of Prudential Securities Futures Management Inc. Immediately after such acquisition, Prudential Securities Futures Management Inc. was merged with and into Preferred. Accordingly, as of
October 1, 2004 all of the board of directors and officers of Prudential Securities Futures Management Inc. resigned. Following Preferred s acquisition of Prudential Securities Futures Management Inc. and its merger with and into
Preferred, Preferred became the successor Managing Owner of the Registrant.       Managing Owner and its Affiliates       The term Managing Owner, as used herein, refers either to Prudential Securities Futures Management Inc. or Preferred, depending upon the applicable period discussed.
     The Managing Owner is required to maintain at least a 1% interest in the Registrant so long as it is acting as the Registrant s Managing Owner.
        
   3   

The Trading Managers       Since inception through January 21, 2003, trading decisions for the Registrant were made by John W. Henry   Company, Inc. (the  Initial Trading Manager ), an independent commodity trading manager which managed 100%
of the Registrant s assets pursuant to four trading programs developed by the Initial Trading Manager. The Managing Owner, decided to pursue a diversified multi-manager approach for the Registrant. To implement the change from a single-to a
multi-manager strategy, the Registrant s advisory agreement with the Initial Trading Manager was terminated effective January 21, 2003. Three new trading managers and programs have been selected to manage the Registrant s assets. On
February 3, 2003, the Managing Owner and the Registrant entered into an advisory agreement with Appleton Capital Management Ltd. ( Appleton ) to manage approximately 20% of the Registrant s assets. On February 7, 2003 the
Managing Owner and the Registrant entered into an advisory agreement with Graham Capital Management, L.P. ( Graham ) to manage approximately 40% of the Registrant s assets. Lastly, on February 14, 2003, the Managing Owner and the
Registrant entered into an advisory agreement with Aspect Capital Limited ( Aspect ) to manage approximately 40% of the Registrant s assets. The Managing Owner retains the authority to override trading instructions that violate the
Registrant s trading policies.       Competition       The
Managing Owner and its affiliates have formed, and may continue to form, various entities to engage in the speculative trading of futures and forward contracts which have certain of the same investment policies as the Registrant.      The Registrant is a closed-end trust which does not currently, and does not intend in the future to, solicit the sale of additional Interests. As such, the Registrant
does not compete with other entities to attract new fund participants. However, to the extent that each trading manager recommends similar or identical trades to the Registrant and other accounts which it manages, the Registrant may compete with
those accounts, as well as with other market participants, for the execution of the same or similar trades.       Employees       The Registrant has no employees. Management and administrative services for the Registrant are performed by the Managing Owner or third parties pursuant to the Trust
Agreement as further discussed in Notes 3 and 4 to the Registrant s financial statements included in its annual report to interest holders for the year ended December 31, 2005 ( Registrant s 2005 Annual Report ) which is
filed as an exhibit hereto.        Available information         The Trust files quarterly, annual and current reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). These reports are available to read and copy at the SEC s Public Reference Facilities in Washington, D.C. at 459
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Please call the SEC s toll free number, 1-800-SEC-0330, for further information. The Trust does not maintain a website where these reports are posted. However, the Trust s filings are posted on
the SEC s website at htttp://www.sec.gov.        
  Item 1A. Risk Factors        THE RISKS YOU FACE        You Should Not Rely on Past Performance in Deciding Whether to Buy Units       Each advisor selected by the Managing Owner
to manage the assets of the Trust has a performance history through the date of its selection by the Managing Owner. You must consider, however, the uncertain significance of past performance, and you should not rely on the advisors  or the
Managing Owner s records to date for predictive purposes. You should not assume that any advisor s future trading decisions will create profit, avoid substantial losses or result in performance for the Trust that is comparable to that
advisor s or to the Managing Owner s past performance. In fact, as a significant amount of academic study has shown, futures funds more frequently than not underperforms the past performance records included in their prospectuses.
      Price Volatility May Possibly Cause the Total Loss of Your Investment       Futures and forward contracts have a high degree of price variability and are subject to occasional rapid and substantial changes. Consequently, you could lose all or substantially all of your investment in the Trust.
        
   4   

Speculative and Volatile Markets Combined With Highly Leveraged Trading May Cause the Trust to Incur Substantial
Losses.       The markets in which the Trust trades are speculative, highly leveraged and involve a high degree of risk. Each Advisor s trading
considered individually involves a significant risk of incurring large losses, and there can be no assurance that the Trust will not incur such losses. Futures and forward prices are volatile. Volatility increases risk, particularly when trading
with leverage. Trading on a highly leveraged basis, as does the Trust, even in stable markets involves risk; doing so in volatile markets necessarily involves a substantial risk of sudden, significant losses. Due to such leverage, even a small
movement in price could cause large losses for the Trust. Market volatility will increase the potential for large losses. Market volatility and leverage mean that the Trust could incur substantial losses, potentially impairing its equity base and
ability to achieve its long-term profit objectives even if favorable market conditions subsequently develop.       Fees and Commissions are Charged
Regardless of Profitability and May Result in Depletion of Trust Assets       The Trust is subject to the fees and expenses which are payable irrespective of
profitability in addition to performance fees which, are payable based on the profitability of the Trust, or if a multi-advisor fund, upon each advisors performance. Consequently, the expenses of the Trust could, over time, result in significant
losses to your investment therein.       Market Conditions May Impair Profitability       The trading systems used by certain advisors are technical, trend-following methods. The profitability of trading under these systems depends on, among other things, the occurrence of significant price trends, which
are sustained movements, up or down, in futures and forward prices. Such trends may not develop; there have been periods in the past without price trends. The likelihood of the Units of the Trust being profitable could be materially diminished
during periods when events external to the markets themselves have an important impact on prices. During such periods, the advisors  historic price analysis could establish positions on the wrong side of the price movements caused by such
events.       Discretionary Trading Strategies May Incur Substantial Losses       Discretionary traders, while they may utilize market charts, computer programs and compilations of quantifiable fundamental information to assist them in making trading decisions, make such decisions on the basis of
their own judgment and  trading instinct,  not on the basis of trading signals generated by any program or model. Such traders may be more prone to subjective judgments, which may have greater potentially adverse effects on their
performance than systematic traders, which emphasize eliminating the effects of  emotionalism  on their trading. Reliance on trading judgment may, over time, produce less consistent trading results than implementing a systematic approach.
Discretionary traders, like trend-following traders, are unlikely to be profitable unless major price movements occur. Discretionary traders are highly unpredictable, and can incur substantial losses even in apparently favorable markets.   
   Systematic Trading Strategies May Incur Substantial Losses       A
systematic trader will generally rely to some degree on judgmental decisions concerning, for example, what markets to follow and commodities to trade, when to liquidate a position in a contract which is about to expire and how large a position to
take in a particular commodity. Although these judgmental decisions may have a substantial effect on a systematic trader s performance, such trader s primary reliance is on trading programs or models that generate trading signals. The
systems utilized to generate trading signals are changed from time to time (although generally infrequently), but the trading instructions generated by the systems being used are followed without significant additional analysis or interpretation.
Therefore, systematic trading may incur substantial losses by failing to capitalize on market trends that their systems would otherwise have exploited by applying their generally mechanical trading systems by judgmental decisions of employees.
Furthermore, any trading system or trader may suffer substantial losses by misjudging the market. Systematic traders tend to rely on computerized programs, and some consider the prospect of disciplined trading, which largely removes the emotion of
the individual trader from the trading process, advantageous. Due to their reliance upon computers, systematic traders are generally able to incorporate a significant amount of data into a particular trading decision. However, when fundamental
factors dominate the market, trading systems may suffer rapid and severe losses due to their inability to respond to such factors until such factors have had a sufficient effect on the market to create a trend of enough magnitude to generate a
reversal of trading signals, by which time a precipitous price change may already be in progress, preventing liquidation at anything but substantial losses.       Decisions Based Upon Fundamental Analysis May Not Result in Profitable Trading       Traders that utilize fundamental trading strategies attempt
to examine factors external to the trading market that affect the supply and demand for a particular futures and forward contracts in order to predict future prices. Such analysis may not result in profitable trading because the analyst may not have
knowledge of all factors affecting supply and demand, prices may often be affected by unrelated factors, and purely fundamental analysis may not enable the trader to determine quickly that previous trading decisions were incorrect. In addition,
because of the breadth of fundamental data that exists, a fundamental trader may not be able to follow developments in all such data, but instead may specialize in analyzing a narrow set of data, requiring trading in fewer markets. Consequently, a
fundamental trader may have less flexibility in adverse markets to trade other futures and forward markets than traders that do not limit the number of markets traded as a result of a specialized focus.         
   5   

Increase in Assets Under Management May Affect Trading Decisions       The more equity an Advisor manages, the more difficult it may be for that advisor to trade profitably because of the difficulty of trading larger positions without
adversely affecting prices and performance. Accordingly, such increases in equity under management may require one or more of the advisors to modify trading decisions for the Trust, which could have a detrimental effect on your investment in the
Trust.       You cannot be Assured of the Advisors  Continued Services Which May Be Detrimental to Trust       You cannot be assured that any advisor will be willing or able to continue to provide advisory services to the Trust for any length of time. There is severe competition
for the services of qualified trading advisors, and the Trust may not be able to retain satisfactory replacement or additional trading advisors on acceptable terms or a current advisor may require the Trust to pay higher fees in order to be able to
retain such advisor.       Limited Ability to Liquidate Your Investment       There is no secondary market for the Units. While the Units have redemption rights, there are restrictions, and possible fees assessed. Transfers of Units are subject to limitations, and the Managing Owner may deny a
request to transfer if it determines that the transfer may result in adverse legal or tax consequences for the Trust.       Possible Illiquid Markets May
Exacerbate Losses       Futures and forward positions cannot always be liquidated at the desired price. It is difficult to execute a trade at a specific
price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market. A market disruption, such as when foreign governments may take or be subject to political actions, which disrupt the markets in their currency or major exports, can
also make it difficult to liquidate a position. Such periods of illiquidity and the events that trigger them are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that any advisor will be able to do so. There can be no assurance that market
illiquidity will not cause losses for the Trust. The large size of the positions which an advisor is expected to acquire for the Trust increases the risk of illiquidity by both making its positions more difficult to liquidate and increasing the
losses incurred while trying to do so.      The risk of loss due to potentially illiquid markets is more acute in respect of over-the-counter instruments than
in respect of exchange-traded instruments because the performance of those contracts is not guaranteed by an exchange or clearinghouse and the Trust will be at risk to the ability of the counterparty to the instrument to perform its obligations
thereunder. Because these markets are not regulated, there are no specific standards or regulatory supervision of trade pricing and other trading activities that occur in those markets.       Because No Trust Acquires Any Asset with Intrinsic Value, the Positive Performance of Your Investment Is Wholly Dependent Upon an Equal and Offsetting Loss       Futures trading is a risk transfer economic activity. For every gain there is an equal and offsetting loss rather than an opportunity to participate over time in general
economic growth. Unlike most alternative investments, an investment in the Trust does not involve acquiring any asset with intrinsic value. Overall stock and bond prices could rise significantly and the economy as a whole prospers; while the Trust
trades unprofitably.       Failure of Futures Trading to be Non-Correlated to General Financial Markets Will Eliminate Benefits of Diversification
      Historically, managed futures generally have been non-correlated to the performance of other asset classes such as stocks and bonds. Non-correlation
means that there is no statistically valid relationship between the past performance of futures and forward contracts on the one hand and stocks or bonds on the other hand. Non-correlation should not be confused with negative correlation, where the
performance would be exactly opposite between two asset classes. Because of this non-correlation, the Trust cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock market, or vice-versa. The futures and forward
markets are fundamentally different from the securities markets in that for every gain in futures and forward trading, there is an equal and offsetting loss. If the Trust does not perform in a manner non-correlated with the general financial markets
or does not perform successfully, you will obtain no diversification benefits by investing in the Units of the Trust and the Trust may have no gains to offset your losses from other investments.       Trading on Commodity Exchanges Outside the United States is Not Subject to U.S. Regulation       Advisors are expected to engage in some or all of its trading on behalf of the Trust on commodity exchanges outside the United States. Trading on such exchanges is not regulated by any United States governmental
agency and may involve certain risks not applicable to trading on United States exchanges. In trading contracts denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, the Trust will be subject to the risk of adverse exchange-rate movements between the
dollar and the functional currencies of such contracts. Investors could incur substantial losses from trading on foreign exchanges by the Trust to which such Investors would not have been subject had the advisors limited their trading to U.S.
markets.         
   6   

Various Actual and Potential Conflicts of Interest May Be Detrimental to Unitholders       The Trust is subject to actual and potential conflicts of interests involving the Managing Owner, the advisors, and various brokers and servicing agents. The Managing
Owner, the advisors, and their respective principals, all of which are engaged in other investment activities, are not required to devote substantially all of their time to the Trust s business, which also presents the potential for numerous
conflicts of interest with the Trust. As a result of these and other relationships, parties involved with the Trust have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interests of the Trust and its Unitholders. The Managing Owner
has not established any formal procedure to resolve conflicts of interest. Consequently, investors will be dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts to resolve them equitably. Although the Managing Owner
attempts to monitor these conflicts, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the Managing Owner to ensure that these conflicts do not, in fact, result in adverse consequences to the Trust.      The Trust may be subject to certain conflicts with respect to its clearing broker, its futures broker, and any executing broker including, but not limited to, conflicts
that result from receiving greater amounts of compensation from other clients, purchasing opposite or competing positions on behalf of third party accounts traded through the clearing broker, the futures broker and executing brokers.       Unitholders Taxed Currently       Unitholders of the Trust are subject to
tax each year on their allocable share of the income or gains (if any) of the Trust, whether or not they receive distributions. Moreover, the Managing Owner does not intend to make any distributions to Unitholders in respect of the Trust.
Consequently, Unitholders of the Trust will be required either to redeem Units or to make use of other sources of funds to discharge their tax liabilities in respect of any profits earned by the Trust.      In comparing the profit objectives of the Trust with the performance of more familiar securities in which one might invest, prospective investors must recognize that if
they purchased equity or debt, there probably would be no tax due on the appreciation in the value of such holdings until disposition. In the case of the Trust, on the other hand, a significant portion of any appreciation in the Net Asset Value per
Unit must be paid in taxes by the Unitholders of the Trust every year, resulting in a substantial cumulative reduction in their net after-tax returns. Because Unitholders of the Trust will be taxed currently on their allocable share of the income or
gains of the Trust, if any, the Trust may trade successfully but investors nevertheless would have recognized significantly greater gains on an after-tax basis had they invested in conventional stocks with comparable performance.       Limitation on Deductibility of  Investment Advisory Fees        Non-corporate Unitholders of the Trust may be required to treat the amount of incentive fees and other expenses of the Trust as  investment advisory fees  which may be subject to substantial restrictions on deductibility for
federal income tax purposes. In the absence of further regulatory or statutory clarification, the Managing Owner is not classifying these expenses as  investment advisory fees,  but this is a position to which the Internal Revenue Service
( the IRS ) may object. If a substantial portion of the fees and other expenses of the Trust were characterized as  investment advisory fees,  an investment in the Trust might no longer be economically viable.       Taxation of Interest Income Irrespective of Trading Losses       With
respect to the Trust, the Net Asset Value per Unit reflects the trading profits and losses as well as the interest income earned and expenses incurred by the Trust. However, losses on the Trust s trading will be almost exclusively capital
losses, and capital losses are deductible against ordinary income only to the extent of $3,000 per year in the case of non-corporate taxpayers. Consequently, if a non-corporate Unitholder had, for example, an allocable trading (i.e., capital) loss
of $10,000 in a given fiscal year and allocable interest (i.e., ordinary) income (after reduction for expenses) of $5,000, the Unitholder would have incurred a net loss in the Net Asset Value of such Unitholder s Units equal to $5,000 but would
recognize taxable income of $2,000 (assuming a 40% tax rate). The limited deductibility of capital losses for non-corporate Unitholders could result in such Unitholders having a tax liability in respect of their investment in the Trust of the Trust
despite incurring a financial loss on their Units of the Trust.       Possibility of a Tax Audit of Both the Trust and the Unitholders       There can be no assurance that the tax returns of the Trust will not be audited by the IRS. If such an audit results in an adjustment, Unitholders of the Trust could
themselves be audited as well as being required to pay additional taxes, interest and possibly penalties.       Failure or Lack of Segregation of Assets May
Increase Losses       The Commodity Exchange Act requires a clearing broker to segregate all funds received from customers from such broker s
proprietary assets. If the clearing broker fails to do so, the assets of the Trust might not be fully protected in the event of their bankruptcy. Furthermore, in the event of the clearing broker s bankruptcy, the Trust could be limited to
recovering only a pro rata share of all available funds segregated on behalf of the clearing broker s combined customer accounts, even though certain property specifically traceable to the Trust (for example, Treasury bills deposited by the
Trust with the clearing broker as margin) was held by the clearing broker.         
   7   

Default by Counterparty and Credit Risk Could Cause Substantial Losses       Dealers in forward contracts are not regulated by the Commodity Exchange Act and are not obligated to segregate customer assets. As a result, Unitholders do not have such
basic protections with respect to the trading in forward contracts by the Trust. This lack of regulation in these markets could expose the Trust in certain circumstances to significant losses in the event of trading abuses or financial failure by
the counterparties. The Trust also faces the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the over-the-counter contracts. Unlike in futures contracts, the counterparty to these contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution,
rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions. As a result, there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions. The clearing member, clearing organization or other counterparty may not be able to
meet its obligations, in which case the Trust could suffer significant losses on these contracts.       Regulatory Changes or Actions May Alter the Nature of
an Investment in the Trust       Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment pools, in particular commodity pools such
as the Trust, publicly distributed in the United States. There has been significant international governmental concern expressed regarding, for example, (i) the disruptive effects of speculative trading on the central banks  attempts to
influence exchange rates and (ii) the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general. There is a possibility of future regulatory changes altering, perhaps to a material extent, the nature of an investment in the Trust.      The futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations, and margin requirements. In addition, the CFTC and the exchanges are authorized to take
extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency, including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading. The
regulation of futures and forward transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to modification by government and judicial action. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Trust is impossible to predict,
but could be substantial and adverse.       Trust Trading is Not Transparent       Trading decisions in respect of the Trust, are made by the advisors. While the Managing Owner receives daily trade confirmations from the clearing broker and foreign exchange dealers, such information is not provided
to Unitholders and the Trust s trading results are reported to the Unitholders. Accordingly, an investment in the Trust does not offer you the same transparency, i.e., an ability to review all investment positions daily that a personal trading
account offers.       Lack of Independent Experts Representing Investors       The Managing Owner has consulted with counsel, accountants and other experts regarding the formation and operation of the Trust. Accordingly, you should consult your own legal, tax and financial advisers regarding the
desirability of an investment in the Trust.       Forwards, Swaps, Hybrids and Other Derivatives are Not Subject to CFTC Regulation       The Trust may trade foreign exchange contracts in the interbank market. Since forward contracts are traded in unregulated markets between principals, the commodity pools
also assume the risk of loss from counterparty nonperformance. In the future, the Trust may also trade swap agreements, hybrid instruments and other off-exchange contracts. Swap agreements involve trading income streams such as fixed rate or
floating rate interest. Hybrids are instruments, which combine features of a security with those of a futures contract. Because there is no exchange or clearinghouse for these contracts, the Trust will be subject to the credit risk and
nonperformance of the counterparty. Additionally, because these off-exchange contracts are not regulated by the CFTC, the Trust will receive the protections, which are provided by the CFTC s regulatory scheme.       Possibility of Termination of the Trust or the Trust Before Expiration of its Stated Term       As Managing Owner, the Managing Owner may withdraw from the Trust, which would cause the Trust to terminate unless a Substitute Managing Owner was appointed. Other events, such as a long-term substantial loss suffered
by the Trust, could also cause the Trust to terminate before the expiration of its stated term. This could cause you to liquidate your investments and upset the overall maturity and timing of your investment portfolio. If the registrations with the
CFTC or memberships in the NFA of the Managing Owner or the clearing broker were revoked or suspended, such entity would no longer be able to provide services to the Trust.

Item 2. Properties       The Registrant does not own or use any physical properties in the conduct of its business. The
Registrant s only place of business is the place of business of Preferred.      Certain administrative services are provided by DPM Mellon which is

  PART II        
  Item 5. Market for the Registrant s Interests, Related Interest Holder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities       On January 5, 1995, the Registrant completed its initial offering and on August 31, 1996 the continuous offering period expired. A significant secondary market for the Limited Interests has not developed, and it is not expected
that one will develop in the future. There are also certain restrictions set forth in the Trust Agreement limiting the ability of an Interest holder to transfer Interests. However, Interests may be redeemed as of the last business day of any
calendar quarter at the then current NAV per Interest. Consequently, holders of Interests may not be able to liquidate their investments in the event of an emergency or for any other reason.      There are no material restrictions upon the Registrant s present or future ability to make distributions in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement.
No distributions have been made since inception and no distributions are anticipated in the future.      As of March 10,
2006, there were 630 holders of record owning 72,350.736 Interests which include 764 General interests.       
  Item 6. Selected Financial Data       The following table presents selected financial data of the Registrant. This data should
be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Registrant and the notes thereto on pages 3 through 15 of the Registrant s 2005 Annual Report which is filed as an exhibit here to.       
     
  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations        Critical
Accounting Policies       Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The Trust s application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used.
        
   9   

The Managing Owner has evaluated the nature and types of estimates that it makes in preparing the Trust s financial
statements and related disclosures and has determined that the valuation of its investments which are not traded on a United States or Internationally recognized futures exchange involves a critical accounting policy. The market values of futures
(exchange traded) contracts is verified by the administrator who obtains valuation data from third party data providers such as Bloomberg and Reuters and compares those prices with the Trust s broker. The market value of currency swap and
forward (non-exchange traded) contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of 3 PM on the last business day of the reporting period. All values assigned by the administrator and confirmed by the Managing Owner are
final and conclusive as to all Interest holders.      As such, if actual results vary from estimates used, they are anticipated to not have a material impact
on the financial statements and related disclosures.       Liquidity and Capital Resources       The Trust commenced operations on January 5, 1995 with gross proceeds of $25,262,800 allocated to commodity trading.      The Trust continued to offer Interests on a monthly basis until the continuous offering period ended on August 31, 1996, resulting in additional gross proceeds to
the Trust of $41,129,100.      The Trust Agreement provides that an Interest holder may redeem its Interests as of the last business day of any calendar
quarter at the then current NAV per Interest. Redemptions of Limited Interests for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $2,808,161, $1,833,152 and $2,966,023, respectively. Redemptions of General Interests for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $24,344, $13,443 and $29,985, respectively. Redemptions of Limited and General Interests from the commencement of operations, January 5, 1995, to December 31, 2005 totaled $83,568,225 and
$705,145, respectively. Future redemptions will impact the amount of funds available for investment in commodity contracts in subsequent periods.      At
December 31, 2005, 100% of the Trust s net assets were allocated to commodities trading. A significant portion of the net assets was held in cash which is used as margin for the Trust s trading in commodities. Inasmuch as the sole
business of the Trust is to trade in commodities, the Trust continues to own such liquid assets to be used as margin. The broker credits the Trust monthly with 100% of the interests it earns on the average net assets in these accounts.   
  The commodities contracts may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons. For example, commodity
exchanges limit fluctuations in certain commodity futures contract prices during a single day by regulations referred to as  daily limits.  During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of
a futures contract for a particular commodity has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the commodity can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit.
Commodity futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. Such market conditions could prevent the Trust from promptly liquidating its commodity futures positions.      Since the Trust s business is to trade futures and forward contracts, its capital is at risk due to changes in the value of these contracts (market risk) or the
inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of the contracts (credit risk). The Trust s exposure to market risk is influenced by a number of factors including the volatility of interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, the
liquidity of the markets in which the contracts are traded and the relationships among the contracts held. The inherent uncertainty of the Trust s speculative trading as well as the development of drastic market occurrences could result in
monthly losses considerably beyond the Trust s experience to date and could ultimately lead to a loss of all or substantially all of investors  capital. The Managing Owner attempts to minimize these risks be requiring the Trust and its
trading managers to abide by various trading limitations and policies, which include limiting margin amounts, trading only in liquid markets and permitting the use of stop loss provisions. See Note 6 to the financial statements for a further
discussion on the credit and market risks associated with the Trust s futures and forward contracts.      The Trust does
not have, nor does it expect to have, any capital assets.       Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations       As of December 31, 2005, the Trust had not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements and has no loan guarantee
arrangements or off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions related to certain risks service providers, such as our accountants,
undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of the Trust. While the Trust s exposure under such indemnification provisions can not be estimated, these general business indemnifications are not expected to have a material
impact on the Trust s financial position.         
   10   

The Trust s contractual obligations are with the Managing Owner, each Trading Manager and its commodity broker.
Payments made under the Trust s agreement with each Trading Manager are at a fixed rate, calculated as a percentage of the Trust s  New High Net Trading Profits . In addition, management fee payments made to the Trading Managers
and fees paid to the Managing Owner are calculated as a fixed percentage of the Trust s Net Asset Value s. As such, the Managing Owner cannot anticipate the amount of payments that will be required under these agreements for futures
periods as Net Asset Value s are not known until a future date. Commission payments to the commodity broker are based on a cost per executed trade and, as such, the Managing Owner cannot anticipate the amount of payments that will be required
under the brokerage agreement for future periods as the level of executed trades are not known until a future date. These agreements are effective for one-year terms, renewable automatically for additional one-year terms unless terminated.
Additionally, these agreements may be terminated by either party for various reason. For a further discussion on these payments, see Notes 1 and 3 of the Registrant s 2005 Annual Report.       Results of Operations       The net asset value per Unit as of
December 31, 2005 was $232.38, a decrease of 2.22% from the December 31, 2004 net asset value per Unit of $237.65, which was a decrease of 7.02% from the December 31, 2003 net asset value per Unit of $255.58. The CISDM CPO Asset
Weighted Index (formerly known as the Zurich Fund/Pool Qualified Universe Index) returned 5.97% and 3.22% for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The CISDM CPO Asset Weighted Index is the dollar weighted, total return of
all commodity pools tracked by Managed Account Reports. LLC past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.      The Partnership s
trading gains/(losses) before commissions were approximately $643,000, $281,000 and $5,448,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Due to the nature of the Partnership s trading activities, a year to year
comparison of its trading results is not meaningful. However, a detailed discussion of the Partnership s current year trading results is presented below.      2005 was an eventful year in the global economic markets. The rise in global energy prices to historic highs was a primary factor that dominated the global economy, along with many other economic, geopolitical and social issues.   
  The U.S. equity markets lagged most foreign equity markets in 2005. The Dow Jones Industrial Index had its first annual loss since 2002, while the technology oriented
Nasdaq Index had a modest 1% gain and the S P 500 Index gained 3% for the year. Overall corporate earnings exceeded expectations for most of the year, including the third and fourth quarters. The impact of several hurricanes, high energy prices
and rising interest rates were among the negative factors for the year.      European equity markets out-performed the U.S. equity markets by a significant
margin for much of the year, with the fourth quarter being particularly strong. Among the three major indices, the German DAX gained 27%, the French CAC 40 gained 23% and the British FTSE 100 was up 17%. Asian equities were stronger than European
equities, as South Korea s Kospi increased 54% and Japan s Nikkei rose 40%. The Nikkei finished the year with seven consecutive monthly gains. Australia s All Ordinaries increased 17%.      One of the notable themes in U.S. interest rates was a flattening yield curve and a gradual trend toward inversion. The inversion finally occurred in December as the
10-year finished with a 4.39% yield versus 4.40% for the 2-year. The inversion was the first in six years. This pattern occurred in the face of 13 consecutive 25 point Federal Open Market Committee rate hikes to 4.25%. In Europe, the European
Central Bank raised rates 25 points to 2.25% but this was not considered an indication of a cycle of rate hikes as European economic growth, while improved, remained fairly modest.      The U.S. dollar ended stronger in 2005, not withstanding a volatile trading pattern during the year. For the year, the U.S. dollar rose approximately 15% against the Japanese yen and the Euro. The interest rate
differential was the primary factor behind the U.S. dollar s solid performance. The British pound finished 2005 lower due to weakness in the U.K. economy. As a result of rate increases by the Bank of Canada, the Canadian dollar gradually gained
versus the U.S. dollar, ending the year up 4.1%. The Australian dollar declined in 2005 despite rate hikes and strong equity markets. The Russian ruble decreased approximately 3.4% for the year. The full impact of the revaluation of the Chinese
renminbi at midyear has yet to be realized.      Crude oil and related products were among the largest gainers in the commodities markets for 2005. Energy
prices peaked in the summer, around the time of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and declined in October and November. Weather was a contributing influence to the decrease as above normal temperatures continued through the end of the year. Global
demand, however, was ever increasing, with China and India in the forefront.      In the metals, gold prices steadily advanced in 2005, particularly in the
final quarter of the year. Strong physical and investment demand, particularly from the Far East, was a yearlong feature. European central banks were reserved sellers and a number of other central banks, such as Russia and OPEC nations, increased
the amount of gold in their reserve asset portfolios. Additionally, gold assumed the role as an alternative currency in 2005 as traders shied away from the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen and Euro. Silver prices tracked gold for much of the year due to
strong physical demand from India in particular. In the base metals, copper prices rose significantly as strong Chinese demand remained a driving force throughout the year.         
   11   

Profits were the result of gains in the energy, indices and metals sectors. The Trust experienced net losses in the
currencies, grains, interest rate and soft sectors.       Currencies: (-)  The currency sector was down for the year. Long and short positions in the New
Zealand dollar and the South African rand versus the U.S. dollar and in the Japanese yen versus the euro negatively impacted the portfolio in 2005.       Energy: (+)  Overall, energies yielded a positive return for the portfolio in 2005, despite net losses in the second and fourth quarters. Profits were generated primarily on long positions in unleaded gas and natural gas in the
third quarter.       Grains: (-)  The grains sector was down for the year, primarily due to long and short positions in cotton and soybean meal.
      Indices: (+)  Losses in the first half of the year were offset by profits in the second half of the year, resulting in a gain for the year.
Long positions in the Tokyo Stock Index, the Nikkei and the CAC 40 were profitable.       Interest Rates: (-)  The interest rate sector was down for the
year, primarily due to long and short positions in the U.S. 5-year and 10-year Treasury Notes and the Australian Bank Bill.       Metals: (+)  The
metals sector was profitable in three out of the four quarters in 2005, with long positions in copper and zinc providing the largest profits.       Softs:
(-)  The sector produced a negative for 2005 as losses on short positions in cocoa, and long and short positions in coffee offset gains from long positions in sugar.      Interest income is earned on the average net assets held at the broker and, therefore, varies monthly according to interest rates, trading performance, and redemptions. Interest income increased approximately $305,000
for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004. This increase was primarily due to higher interest rates during 2005 compared to 2004, offset, in part by redemptions in 2005. Interest income increased approximately $3,000 during 2004 as
compared to 2003 due to decreasing asset levels, offset by increased interest rates.      Commissions are calculated on the Trust s net asset value at the
beginning of each month and, therefore, vary according to trading performance and redemptions. Commissions decreased approximately $261,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004 and $88,000 for the year ended December 31,
2004 compared to 2003. The decrease in 2005 versus 2004 was primarily due to net lower asset values from redemptions and performance. The decrease in 2004 versus 2003 was primarily due to the Trust not incurring commissions on the portion of assets
unallocated to trading until February 2003 when each of the new trading managers began trading.      All trading decisions for the Trust were made by the
Initial Trading Manager until January 21, 2003. Three new trading managers and programs have been selected by the Managing Owner to manage the Trust s assets effective February 2003. Management fees are calculated on the Trust s net
asset value at the end of each month and, therefore, are affected by trading performance and redemptions. Management fees decreased approximately $67,000 and $30,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 compared to the corresponding
periods in the prior years for the same reasons commissions decreased as discussed above.      Incentive fees were based on the New High Net Trading Profits
generated by the Initial Trading Manager, through February 2003, as defined in the Amended Advisory Agreement among the Trust, the Managing Owner and the Initial Trading Manager. Effective February 2003, incentive fees are based on the New High
Trading Profits generated by the new trading managers, as defined in the Advisory Agreements among the Trust, the Managing Owner and the new trading managers. Incentive fees of $0 were incurred for the year ended December 31, 2005. Incentive
fees of approximately $237,000 were incurred for the year ended December 31, 2004. Incentive fees of approximately $361,000 were incurred for the year ended December 31, 2003.       Inflation       Inflation has had no material impact on operations or on the financial condition of the Partnership from
inception through December 31, 2005.       
  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       Information regarding quantitative and qualitative
disclosures about market risk is not required pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K.       
  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data       The financial statements are incorporated by reference to pages 3
through 15 of the Registrant s 2005 Annual Report which is filed as an exhibit hereto.

Selected unaudited quarterly financial data for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 are summarized below:

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure       On October 18, 2005,
the Board of Directors of Preferred dismissed Arthur F. Bell, Jr.   Associates, L.L.C. ( AFB ) as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Registrant. The report of AFB on the Registrant s financial
statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainties, audit scope, or accounting principles. AFB was engaged by
Diversified Futures Trust I on October 1, 2004.      During the Registrant s fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 and during the period then
ended through the date of the most recently filed Form 8-K, the Registrant and the Managing Owner have had no disagreements with AFB on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure,
which disagreement(s), if not resolved to the satisfaction of AFB, would have caused it to make a reference to the subject matter thereof in its report on the financial statements of the Registrant for such period.      On October 18, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Managing Owner, on behalf of the Registrant, approved the engagement of Deloitte   Touche LLP
( D T ) as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Registrant. During the Registrant s two most recent fiscal years and the interim period prior to engaging D T, neither the Registrant, the Managing Owner,
nor anyone on their behalf consulted D T, on behalf of the Registrant, regarding the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction (either completed or proposed), the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the
Registrant s financial statements, or any matter that was either the subject of a  disagreement,  as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto, or a  reportable event,  as defined in
Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.       
  Item 9A. Controls and Procedures       As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Managing Owner carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the officers of the Managing Owner, including the Managing Owner s chief executive officer, chief financial officer and director of fund administration, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of the Registrant s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the Managing Owner s chief executive officer, chief financial officer and director of fund administration concluded that the
Registrant s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.      There have not been any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a   15(e) and 15d   15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal controls over financial reporting.

PART III        
  Item 10. Directors and Executive Officer of the Registrant       There are no officers of the
Registrant. The Registrant is managed by the Managing Owner.      The key officers of the Managing Owner and their positions
with respect to the Registrant are as follows:       Mr. Kenneth A. Shewer  (born 1953), has been a principal, associated person and NFA
associate member of the Managing Owner since February 8, 1984, May 1,1985 since August 1, 1985, respectively. He has been Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer of the Managing Owner since February 1984. Mr. Shewer was
employed by Pasternak, Baum and Co., Inc. ( Pasternak, Baum ), an international cash commodity firm, from June 1976 until September 1983. Mr. Shewer created and managed Pasternak, Baum s Grain Logistics and Administration
Department and created its Domestic Corn and Soybean Trading Department. Mr. Shewer s responsibilities at Pasternak, Baum included merchandising South American grain and exporting United States corn and soybeans. In 1982, Mr. Shewer
became co-manager of Pasternak, Baum s F.O.B. Corn Department. In 1983, Mr. Shewer was made Vice President and Director of Pasternak, Baum. Mr. Shewer has traveled extensively in South America and Europe in connection with the
commodity business and has organized and effected grain and oilseed sales in those regions, the former Soviet Union, and the Far East. While at Pasternak, Baum, Mr. Shewer was a member of the St. Louis Merchants Exchange and was associated with
the National Grain and Feed Association and the North American Export Grain Association.      Mr. Shewer graduated from Syracuse University with a B.S.
degree in 1975. Mr. Shewer sits on the Board of the Stacy Joy Goodman Memorial Foundation, a non-profit charity committed to finding a cure for Juvenile Diabetes. He is also a member of the Board of the Diabetes Research Institute Foundation, a
not-for-profit organization affiliated with the University of Miami School of Medicine. Mr. Shewer is a founding member and member of the Board of the Greenwich Roundtable.       Mr. Marc S. Goodman  (born 1948) has been a principal, associated person and NFA associate member of the Managing Owner since February 7, 1984, May 1, 1985 since August 1, 1985,
respectively. He has been President and Co-Chief Executive Officer of the Managing Owner since February 1984. Mr. Goodman joined Pasternak, Baum in September 1974 and was a Vice President and Director from July 1981 until September 1983. While
at Pasternak, Baum, Mr. Goodman was largely responsible for business development outside of the United States, for investment of its corporate retirement funds, and for selecting trading personnel in the Vegetable Oil Division Mr. Goodman
also created and developed Pasternak, Baum s Laric Oils Department. Mr. Goodman has conducted extensive business in South America, Europe and the Far East; he has been a merchandiser of all major vegetable oils and their by-products, and

require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.      In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Diversified Futures Trust I at
December 31, 2005, and the results of its operations and changes in its trust capital for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.      /s/ Deloitte   Touche LLP      March 29, 2006

DIVERSIFIED FUTURES TRUST I        NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS             

Note 1.  
   ORGANIZATION          

A.  
  General Description of the Trust        Diversified Futures
Trust I (the  Trust ) was organized under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act on May 18, 1994 and will continue until December 31, 2020 unless terminated sooner under the provisions of the Second Amended and Restated Declaration of
Trust and Trust Agreement (the  Trust Agreement ). The Trust was formed to engage in the speculative trading of commodity futures and forward contracts. The Trust s trustee is Wilmington Trust Company.      On July 1, 2003, Prudential Financial, Inc. ( Prudential ) and Wachovia Corp. ( Wachovia ) combined their separate retail
securities brokerage and clearing businesses under a new holding company named Wachovia/Prudential Financial Advisors, LLC ( WPFA ), owned 62% by Wachovia and 38% by Prudential. As a result, the retail brokerage operations of Prudential
Securities Incorporated ( PSI ) were contributed to Wachovia Securities, LLC ( Wachovia Securities ). Wachovia Securities is wholly-owned by WPFA and is a registered broker-dealer and a member of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. ( NASD ) and all major securities exchanges. The Trust and its Managing Owner, Prudential Securities Futures Management Inc., entered into a service agreement with Wachovia Securities, effective July 1, 2003.
Pursuant to this agreement, Wachovia Securities agreed to provide certain enumerated services to accounts of the limited interest owners carried at Wachovia.      Effective July 1, 2003, PSI changed its name to Prudential Equity Group, Inc. ( PEG ). PEG remains an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential. PEG was a registered broker-dealer and a member of
the NASD and all major securities exchanges and conducted the equity research, domestic and international equity sales and trading operations, and commodity brokerage and derivative operations it had previously conducted as PSI until
December 31, 2003. As part of the process of reorganizing its business structure, Prudential Securities Group, Inc. ( PSG ), the direct parent of PEG and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential, transferred the commodity brokerage,
commodity clearing and derivative operations previously performed by PEG to another PSG indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Prudential Financial Derivatives, LLC ( PFD ) effective January 1, 2004. Like PEG, PFD is registered as a
futures commission merchant under the Commodity Exchange Act and is a member of the National Futures Association. On April 1, 2004, PEG transferred the ownership of the Managing Owner and PFD Holdings, LLC, the direct parent of PFD to PSG.
     On June 30, 2004, PSG and Preferred Investment Solutions Corp., formerly Kenmar Advisory Corp. ( Preferred ), entered into
a Stock Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which PSG would sell, and Preferred would buy, all of the capital stock of Prudential Securities Futures Management Inc. (the then current Managing Owner of the Trust) and another commodity pool operator owned
by PSG. In connection with the transaction, Prudential Securities Futures Management Inc. solicited proxies seeking approval from the Trust s Interest holders for (i) the sale of the stock of Prudential Securities Futures Management
Inc. to Preferred; (ii) the concomitant approval of Preferred as the new Managing Owner of the Trust; and (iii) the approval of certain amendments to the Declaration of the Trust and Trust Agreement of the Trust. A report on Form 8-K
describing the transaction was filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on July 1, 2004 and the definitive proxies were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 20, 2004.

Note 1.  
   ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)          

A.  
  General Description of the Trust (Continued)        As of
October 1, 2004, Preferred acquired from PSG all of the outstanding stock of Prudential Securities Futures Management Inc. Immediately after such acquisition, Prudential Securities Futures Management Inc. was merged with and into Preferred.
Accordingly, as of October 1, 2004 all of the board of directors and officers of Prudential Securities Futures Management Inc. resigned. Following Preferred s acquisition of Prudential Securities Futures Management Inc. and its merger with
and into Preferred, Preferred became the successor Managing Owner of the Trust.      The term Managing Owner, as used herein, refers either to
Prudential Securities Futures Management Inc. or Preferred, depending upon the applicable period discussed.       

B.  
  Regulation        As a registrant with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the Trust is subject to the regulatory requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a commodity pool, the Trust is subject to the regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, an agency of the United States (U.S.) government which regulates most aspects of the commodity futures industry; rules of the National Futures Association, an industry self-regulatory organization; and the requirements of the various
commodity exchanges where the Trust executes transactions. Additionally, the Trust is subject to the requirements of the futures commission merchants (brokers) and interbank market makers through which the Trust trades.       

C.  
  The Offering        On January 5, 1995, the Trust
completed its initial offering having raised $25,262,800 from the sale of 249,628 limited interests ( Limited Interests ) and 3,000 general interests ( General Interests ) (collectively, the  Interests ). Additional
interests were offered and sold monthly at the then current net asset value ( NAV ) per Interest until the continuous offering period expired on August 31, 1996. Additional contributions raised during the continuous offering period
resulted in additional proceeds to the Trust of $41,129,100 from the sale of 299,640 Limited Interests and 1,628 General Interests. General Interests were sold exclusively to the Managing Owner.      The Managing Owner is required to maintain at least a 1% interest in the Trust so long as it is acting as the Managing Owner.

   ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)          

D.  
  The Trading Managers        Since inception through
January 21, 2003, all trading decisions were made for the Trust by John W. Henry   Company, Inc. (the  Initial Trading Manager ), an independent commodity trading manager. The Initial Trading Manager traded the Trust s
assets pursuant to four of its trading programs: the Financial and Metals Portfolio; the Global Financial Portfolio; the Original Investment Program; and the G-7 Currency Portfolio. The Managing Owner decided to pursue a diversified multi-manager
approach for the Trust. To implement the change from a single to multi-manager strategy, the Trust s advisory agreement with the Initial Trading Manager was terminated effective January 21, 2003. Three new trading managers and programs
were selected by the Managing Owner to manage the Trust s assets. On February 3, 2003, the Managing Owner and the Trust entered into an advisory agreement with Appleton Capital Management Ltd. ( Appleton ) to manage approximately
20% of the Trust s assets pursuant to Appleton s 25% Risk Program. On February 7, 2003, the Managing Owner and the Trust entered into an advisory agreement with Graham Capital Management, L.P. ( Graham ) to manage
approximately 40% of the Trust s assets utilizing Graham s Global Diversified Program at 1.5x leverage. Lastly, on February 14, 2003 the Managing Owner and the Trust entered into an advisory agreement with Aspect Capital Limited
( Aspect ) to manage on behalf of the Trust approximately 40% of the Trust s assets employing Aspect s Diversified Program. From January 21, 2003 until each trading manager began trading, all unallocated assets were invested
in interest-bearing accounts. Pursuant to the advisory agreements, each of the trading managers (Appleton, Graham and Aspect) are paid a monthly management fee equal to 1/12 of 2% annually and an incentive fee of 20% of the  New High Net
Trading Profits  on the portion of Trust assets allocated to each, which are the same rates that were paid to the Initial Trading Manager. The Trust did not incur commissions and management fees on the portion of assets unallocated to trading
(i.e. the portion of assets previously managed by the Initial Trading Manager) until such time as Appleton, Graham and Aspect began trading. The advisory agreements may be terminated for a variety of reasons, including at the discretion of the
Managing Owner. The Managing Owner retains the authority to override trading instructions that violate the Trust s trading policies.       

Note 2.  
   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES          

A.  
  Basis of Accounting        The financial statements of the
Trust are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Such principles require the Managing Owner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.         
   -10-

Note 2.  
   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)          

A.  
  Basis of Accounting (Continued)        Commodity futures and
forward transactions are reflected in the accompanying statements of financial condition on trade date. Net unrealized gain or loss on open contracts (the difference between contract trade price and market price) is reflected in the statement of
financial condition in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 39    Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts.  The market value of futures (exchange-traded) contracts is based upon the
closing quotation on the various futures exchanges on which the contract is traded. The fair value of swap and forward (non-exchange traded) contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices. Any change in net unrealized gain or loss
during the current period is reported in the statement of operations. Realized gains and losses on commodity transactions are recognized in the period in which the contracts are closed.      The weighted average number of Limited and General Interests outstanding was computed for purposes of disclosing net income (loss) per weighted average
Limited and General Interest. The weighted average Limited and General Interests are equal to the number of interests outstanding at period end, adjusted proportionately for interests redeemed based on their respective time outstanding during such
year.      The Trust has elected not to provide a Statement of Cash Flows as permitted by Statement of Financial Account Standards
No. 102,  Statement of Cash Flows   Exemption of Certain Enterprises and Classification of Cash Flows from Certain Securities Acquired for Resale.       Consistent with standard business practices in the normal course of business, the Trust has provided general indemnifications to the Managing Owner, its Trading Advisor and others when they act, in good faith, in the
best interests of the Trust. The Trust is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim, but expects the risk of having to make any payments under
these general business indemnifications to be remote.      Cash represents amounts deposited with clearing brokers, a portion of which are
restricted for purposes of meeting margin requirements, which typically range from 0% to 35% of the notional amounts of the derivatives traded, and receives interest on all cash balances held by the clearing brokers at prevailing rates.   

B.  
  Income Taxes        The Trust is treated as a partnership for
Federal income tax purposes. As such, the Trust is not required to provide for, or pay, any Federal or state income taxes. Income tax attributes that arise from its operations are passed directly to the individual Interest holders. The Trust may be
subject to other state and local taxes in jurisdictions in which it operates.

Note 2.  
   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)          

C.  
  Profit and Loss Allocation, Distributions and Redemptions        Net income or loss for both financial and tax reporting purposes is allocated monthly to all interest holders on a pro rata basis on each interest holder s number of interests outstanding during the month.      Distributions (other than redemptions of interests) are made at the sole discretion of the Managing Owner on a pro rata basis in accordance with the
respective capital accounts of the interest holders. The Managing Owner has not and does not intend to make any distributions.      The Trust
Agreement provides that an Interest holder may redeem its Interests as of the last business day of any calendar quarter at the then current NAV per interest.       

D.  
  Foreign currency transaction        The Trust s functional
currency is the U.S. dollar; however, it transacts business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect at the date of
the statement of financial condition. Income and expense items denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses resulting from the translation to U.S.
dollars are reported in income currently.       

A.  
  Organizational and General and Administrative Costs        PEG
or its affiliates paid the cost of organizing the Trust and offering its Interests and continued to pay the administrative costs incurred by the Managing Owner or its affiliates for services they performed for the Trust through September 30,
2004. Effective October 1, 2004, Preferred pays all administrative costs for services it performs for the Trust. Administrative costs include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Note 4 below. Routine legal, audit, postage, and other
routine third party administrative costs also were paid by PEG or its affiliates through September 30, 2004 and by Preferred for the period October 1, 2004 to December 31, 2005.

Note 3.  
   FEES (CONTINUED)          

B.  
  Management and Incentive Fees        The Trust paid the Initial
Trading Manager a monthly management fee and quarterly incentive fee. Effective on October 1, 2000, the Advisory Agreement among the Trust, the Managing Owner and the Initial Trading Manager was amended (the  Amended Advisory
Agreement ). The Amended Advisory Agreement reduced the monthly management fee paid to the Initial Trading Manager from 1/12 of a 4% per annum rate of the Trust s NAV as of the end of each month to 1/12 of a 2% per annum rate.
Additionally, if the Initial Trading Manager achieved  New High Net Trading Profits  (as defined in the Amended Advisory Agreement), the Initial Trading Manager would earn a 20% incentive fee as compared to a 15% incentive fee previously
paid. The Managing Owner terminated the Trust s Amended Advisory Agreement with the Initial Trading Manager, effective January 21, 2003. Three new trading managers were selected to manage the Trust s assets as previously discussed in
Note 1D. Pursuant to the advisory agreements, each of the trading managers are paid a monthly management fee equal to 1/6 of 1% (a 2% annual rate) and an incentive fee of 20% of the  New High Net Trading Profits  on the portion of Trust
assets allocated to each, which are the same rates that were paid to the Initial Trading Manager.       

C.  
  Commissions        Prior to January 1, 2004, Prudential
Securities Futures Management, Inc., as Managing Owner, on behalf of the Trust, entered into an agreement with PEG as commodity broker whereby the Trust pays a fixed monthly fee for brokerage services rendered. The monthly fee equals .64583 of 1%
(7.75% per annum) of the Trust s NAV as of the first day of each month. From this fee, PEG paid all of the Trust s execution (including floor brokerage expenses and NFA, clearing and exchange fees) and account maintenance costs. As
previously discussed in Note 1D, the Trust did not incur commissions during 2003 on the portion of assets unallocated to trading until such time as the new trading managers began trading.      On January 1, 2004, PEG, a wholly owned subsidiary of PSG, transferred its Global Derivatives Division to PFD and Pru Global Securities, LLC, two
other indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of PSG. In connection with this transfer, PEG assigned its brokerage agreement with the Trust to PFD, a properly qualified futures commission merchant.      On October 1, 2004, an agreement was executed between Preferred and PFD which amended and restated the brokerage commissions which were previously
paid to PFD, excluding transaction fees which will be paid to PFD. The agreement incorporates the previous PFD brokerage agreement s terms, including the total fees paid by the Trust. Under the agreement, PFD s transaction based fees will
be paid out of the total fees paid by the Trust to Preferred.

Note 4.  
   RELATED PARTIES         The Managing Owner or third
parties engaged by the Managing Owner perform services for the Trust which include, but are not limited to: brokerage services; accounting and financial management; registrar, transfer and assignment function; investor communications; printing and
other administrative services. Except for costs related to brokerage services, PEG or its affiliates paid all the costs of these services as well as the Trust s routine operational, administrative, legal and auditing costs through
September 30, 2004. Effective October 1, 2004, Preferred began performing such services for the Trust with the exception of brokerage services. Preferred pays all of the costs of such services.      The costs charged to the Trust for brokerage services for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $1,387,137, $1,647,827 and
$1,735,735, respectively.      The Trust s assets are maintained either in trading or cash accounts at PFD, the Trust s commodity
broker, or for margin purposes, with the various exchanges on which the Trust is permitted to trade. PFD credits the Trust monthly with 100% of the interest it earns on the average net assets in the Trust s accounts.      The Trust, acting through its trading managers, executes over-the-counter, spot, forward and/or option foreign exchange transactions with its broker (PEG
through December 31, 2003 and PFD effective January 1, 2004). The respective broker then engages in back-to-back trading with an affiliate, Prudential-Bache Global Markets, Inc. ( PBGM ). PBGM attempts to earn a profit on such
transactions. PBGM keeps its prices on foreign currency competitive with other interbank currency trading desks. All over-the-counter currency transactions are conducted between the Trust and its broker pursuant to a line of credit. The broker may
require that collateral be posted against the marked-to-market position of the Trust.       

Note 5.  
   INCOME TAXES         There have been no differences
between the tax basis and book basis of interest holders  capital since inception of the Trust.       

Note 6.  
   DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND ASSOCIATED RISKS         The
Trust is exposed to various types of risks associated with the derivative instruments and related markets in which it invests. These risks include, but are not limited to, risk of loss from fluctuations in the value of derivative instruments held
(market risk) and the inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of the Trust s investment activities (credit risk).         
   -14-   

DIVERSIFIED FUTURES TRUST I        NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)             

Note 6.  
   DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND ASSOCIATED RISKS (CONTINUED)          Market Risk       Trading in futures and forward contracts (including foreign exchange) involves entering into contractual
commitments to purchase or sell a particular commodity at a specified date and price. The gross or face amount of the contracts, which is typically many times that of the Trust s net assets being traded, significantly exceeds the Trust s
future cash requirements since the Trust intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement. As a result, the Trust is generally subject only to the risk of loss arising from the change in the value of the contracts. As such, the Trust
considers the  fair value  of its derivative instruments to be the net unrealized gain or loss on the contracts. The market risk associated with the Trust s commitments to purchase commodities is limited to the gross or face amount of
the contracts held. However, when the Trust enters into a contractual commitment to sell commodities, it must make delivery of the underlying commodity at the contract price and then repurchase the contract at prevailing market prices or settle in
cash. Since the repurchase price to which a commodity can rise is unlimited, entering into commitments to sell commodities exposes the Trust to unlimited risk.      Market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including government programs and policies, political and economic events, the level and volatility of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, the
diversification effects among the derivative instruments the Trust holds and the liquidity and inherent volatility of the markets in which the Trust trades.       Credit Risk       When entering into futures or forward contracts, the Trust is exposed to credit risk
that the counterparty to the contract will not meet its obligations. The counterparty for futures contracts traded on United States and most foreign futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange. In general,
clearinghouses are backed by their corporate members who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the
clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members (i.e. some foreign exchanges), it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. On the other hand, there is concentration risk on forward transactions entered into by
the Trust as the Trust s commodity broker (as defined in Note 4) is the sole counterparty. The Trust has entered into a master netting agreement with its broker and, as a result when applicable, presents unrealized gains and losses on open
forward positions as a net amount in the statements of financial condition; however, counterparty non-performance on only certain of the Trust s contracts may result in greater loss than non-performance on all of the Trust s contracts. The
amount at risk associated with counterparty non-performance of all of the Trust s contracts is the net unrealized gain included in the statements of financial condition. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearing member or
clearinghouse will meet its obligations to the Trust.

Note 6.  
   DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND ASSOCIATED RISKS (CONTINUED)          Credit Risk (Continued)       The Managing Owner attempts to minimize both credit and market risks by requiring the Trust and its
trading managers to abide by various trading limitations and policies. The Managing Owner monitors compliance with these trading limitations and policies, which include, but are not limited to, executing and clearing all trades with creditworthy
counterparties; limiting the amount of margin or premium required for any one commodity or all commodities combined; and generally limiting transactions to contracts which are traded in sufficient volume to permit the taking and liquidating of
positions. Additionally, pursuant to the Advisory Agreement among the Trust, the Managing Owner has the right, among others, to terminate each trading manager if the net asset value allocated to the trading manager declines by 33-1/3% from the value
at the beginning of any year or since the commencement of trading activities. Furthermore, the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement provides that the Trust will liquidate its positions, and eventually dissolve, if the Trust
experiences a decline in the net asset value of 50% from the value at the beginning of any year or since the commencement of trading activities. In each case, the decline in net asset value is after giving effect for distributions and redemptions.
The Managing Owner may impose additional restrictions (through modifications of trading limitations and policies) upon the trading activities of the trading manager as it, in good faith, deems to be in the best interests of the Trust.      The Trust s futures commission merchant in accepting orders for the purchase or sale of domestic futures contracts, is required by Commodity Futures
Trading Commission ( CFTC ) regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to the Trust all assets of the Trust relating to domestic futures trading and is not to commingle such assets with its other assets. At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, such segregated assets totaled $8,829,027 and $13,404,536, respectively. Part 30.7 of the CFTC regulations also requires the Trust s futures commission merchant to secure assets of the Trust related to foreign
futures trading which totaled $340,601 and $7,522,604 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. There are no segregation requirements for assets related to forward trading.      As of December 31, 2005, all of the Trust s open futures and forward contracts mature within two years.
