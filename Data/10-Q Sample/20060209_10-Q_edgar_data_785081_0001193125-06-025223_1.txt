VIRAGEN INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
       (Unaudited)              NOTE A   OVERVIEW AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION             We are engaged in the research, development, manufacture, and sale of a natural human alpha interferon product indicated for treatment of a broad range of
viral and malignant diseases. We produce a natural human alpha interferon product under the tradename of  Multiferon           from human white blood cells, also known as leukocytes. Natural alpha interferon is one of the body s most important natural defense mechanisms to
foreign substances like viruses, but it also stimulates and modulates the human immune system.            We are a majority owned subsidiary of Viragen, Inc. (Viragen) (AMEX: VRA). As of December 31, 2005, Viragen owned 59,818,301 shares of our common stock representing approximately 81.2% of our 73,669,320
outstanding shares. We operate primarily through our foreign wholly owned subsidiaries, ViraNative AB ( ViraNative ), a company located in Ume , Sweden and Viragen (Scotland) Limited ( Viragen (Scotland) ), a company
located near Edinburgh, Scotland. ViraNative and Viragen (Scotland) house our manufacturing and research laboratory facilities.            The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated condensed financial statements include Viragen International, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries, including
those operating outside the United States of America. All significant transactions among our subsidiaries have been eliminated. These statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
consistent in all material respects with those applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.            The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated condensed financial statements for Viragen International have been prepared
in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K have been condensed or
omitted. The accompanying interim consolidated condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in this report and the audited
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005.            The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. The accounting estimates that require
management s most difficult and subjective judgments include: the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and long-lived assets and the valuation of inventories. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.            The interim financial information is unaudited, but, in the opinion of
management, reflects all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation of results of the interim periods presented. Operating results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2005 are
not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006.

    VIRAGEN INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)        (Unaudited)              NOTE A   OVERVIEW
AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION   (Continued)             During the
three and six months ended December 31, 2005 we incurred a loss of approximately $1.9 million and $3.7 million, respectively. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we incurred losses of approximately $15.6 million,
$7.1 million and $5.2 million, respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of approximately $62.4 million as of December 31, 2005. We had a cash balance of approximately $599,000 and working capital of approximately $1.8 million at
December 31, 2005. We anticipate additional future losses as we commercialize our natural human alpha interferon product and conduct additional research and development activities and clinical trials to obtain additional regulatory approvals.
Accordingly, we will require substantial additional funding. Historically, Viragen has provided us with the working capital necessary to fund operations. Viragen has sufficient capital on hand to fund their operations through February 2006 and has
agreed to provide us with the working capital necessary to fund our operations through February 2006. Viragen will require substantial additional funding to support our operations subsequent to February 2006. As we do not anticipate achieving
sufficient cash flows from our operations, we will be dependent upon Viragen for additional funding. Viragen is seeking additional capital through equity and debt financings. No assurance can be given that additional capital will be available when
required or upon terms acceptable to Viragen. Viragen s or our inability to generate substantial revenue or obtain additional capital through equity or debt financings, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our
ability to continue operations. Accordingly, if Viragen or we are unable to obtain additional financing by the end of February 2006, we could be forced to significantly curtail or suspend our operations, including laying-off employees, recording
asset impairment write-downs and other measures.            As a result
of these financial conditions, the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our June 30, 2005 consolidated financial statements includes an explanatory paragraph indicating that these conditions raise substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and
classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.             NOTE B   STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION             At December 31, 2005, we had one stock-based compensation plan, which is approved by our stockholders. Prior to July 1, 2005, we accounted for that plan under the recognition and measurement provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees , and related Interpretations, as permitted by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation . No stock-based compensation cost was recognized in our statements of operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2004 as all stock options granted under the plan had an exercise price equal to the market value
of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION   (Continued)             Effective
July 1, 2005, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R),  Share-Based Payment , using the modified-prospective transition method. Under that transition method, stock-based compensation cost
recognized subsequent to July 1, 2005 includes: (a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of July 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
provisions of Statement No. 123, and (b) compensation cost for all stock-based compensation granted subsequent to July 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of Statement
No. 123(R). For the three and six months ended December 31, 2005, we did not recognize any stock-based compensation costs in the statement of operations as all stock options granted to employees and directors prior to July 1, 2005
were fully vested as of July 1, 2005 and no stock-based compensation was granted during the three and six months ended December 31, 2005. Accordingly, results for prior periods have not been restated.            The following table illustrates the effect on net loss and loss per common
share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R) to measure stock-based compensation for the three and six months ended December 31, 2004.

INVENTORIES             Inventories consist of raw materials and
supplies, work in process, and finished product. Finished product consists of purified natural human alpha interferon that is available for sale. Costs of raw materials and supplies are determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Costs of work in
process and finished product, consisting of raw materials, labor and overhead are recorded at a standard cost (which approximates actual cost). Excess/idle capacity costs represent fixed production costs incurred at our Swedish manufacturing
facilities, which were not absorbed as a result of the production of inventory at less than normal operating levels. Excess/idle capacity costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred and are included in cost of sales.            Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (estimated net
realizable value). If the cost of the inventories exceeds their expected market value, provisions are recorded currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. These provisions are determined based on estimates. The valuation of
our inventories also requires us to estimate excess inventories and inventories that are not saleable. The determination of excess or non-saleable inventories requires us to estimate the future demand for our product and consider the shelf life of
the inventory. If actual demand is less than our estimated demand, we could be required to record inventory write-downs, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations. During the quarter ended December 31, 2005, we determined
that a portion of our work in process inventory would not be converted to finished product prior to expiration. Therefore, we recorded a write-down for this inventory of approximately $104,000. During the quarter ended September 30, 2005, a
freezer at one of our facilities in Sweden malfunctioned causing the temperature of certain work in process to rise above the approved levels for frozen product. As a result, we were unable to utilize this inventory for commercial purposes and we
recorded a net write-down of approximately $91,000, which was net of an insurance recovery of approximately $486,000.            Inventories consisted of the following at December 31, 2005 and June 30, 2005:         
          Certain raw materials
used in the manufacture of our natural human alpha interferon product, including human white blood cells, are only available from a limited number of suppliers. We are dependent on our suppliers to allocate a sufficient portion of their capacity to
meet our needs.

    VIRAGEN INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)        (Unaudited)              NOTE D   GOODWILL
AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS             On September 28, 2001,
we acquired all of the outstanding shares of BioNative AB ( BioNative ), a privately held biotechnology company located in Ume , Sweden. Subsequent to the acquisition, BioNative was renamed ViraNative .  The initial purchase
consideration consisted of 2,933,190 shares of Viragen International common stock. In January 2002, ViraNative achieved two milestones defined in the acquisition agreement. As a result, the former shareholders of ViraNative were issued an additional
8,799,570 shares of Viragen International common stock.            The
goodwill reported in our balance sheets as of December 31, 2005 and June 30, 2005 arose from our acquisition of ViraNative and the subsequent achievement of the milestones. Subsequent to the initial recording of goodwill, the carrying
amount has increased as a result of foreign currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Swedish Krona. The following table reflects the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the six months ended December 31, 2005:   
     
          In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,  goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment arise. We periodically evaluate
that acquired business for potential impairment indicators. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors, market conditions, and the operational performance of the acquired business. As of April 1,
2005, we evaluated our goodwill for impairment. The impairment review indicated that our goodwill was impaired and, as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $6.9 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Future
changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including revenue projections or market values, could cause our analysis to indicate that our goodwill is further impaired in subsequent periods and result in a write-off of a portion
or all of our goodwill.

AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS   (Continued)             The
developed technology intangible asset reported in our balance sheets as of December 31, 2005 and June 30, 2005 arose from our acquisition of ViraNative on September 28, 2001. A detail of our developed technology intangible asset as of
December 31, 2005 and June 30, 2005 is as follows:         
          Our developed
technology consists of the production and purification methods developed by ViraNative prior to the acquisition by Viragen International. This technology was complete and ViraNative had been selling the resultant natural interferon product prior to
the acquisition by Viragen International. Developed technology was recorded at its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Subsequent to the initial recording of this intangible asset, the gross carrying amount has increased by
approximately $502,000 as a result of foreign currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Swedish Krona.            Developed technology is being amortized over its estimated useful life of approximately 14 years. The 14-year life assigned to this asset was determined
using a weighted average of the remaining lives of the patents on the various components of the production and purification processes.             NOTE E   DEBT              Line of Credit             Our
Swedish subsidiary maintains an overdraft facility, denominated in Swedish Krona, with a bank in Sweden. In July 2004, the terms of this overdraft facility were renegotiated to provide for a reduced interest rate and a reduction in the maximum
borrowing capacity. The maximum borrowing capacity on this overdraft facility was approximately $710,000 as of December 31, 2005 compared to $767,000 at June 30, 2005. Borrowings outstanding under this overdraft facility are at a floating
rate of interest, which was approximately 5.25% at December 31, 2005 and June 30, 2005. This overdraft facility was renewed in December 2005 and will expire at the end of February 2006. There was no outstanding balance under this overdraft
facility as of December 31, 2005 or June 30, 2005. This overdraft facility is secured by certain assets of ViraNative including inventories and accounts receivable.

  (Continued)              Long-Term Debt             Our Swedish subsidiary has a 25-year mortgage with a Swedish bank obtained
to purchase one of our facilities in Sweden. The outstanding principal balance on this loan, which is payable in Swedish Krona, was approximately $605,000 and $631,000 at December 31, 2005 and June 30, 2005, respectively. This loan carries
a floating rate of interest, which was approximately 5.25% at December 31, 2005 and June 30, 2005. We are required to make quarterly payments of principal and interest of approximately $17,000 under this agreement. This loan matures in
September 2024 and is secured by the related land and building, including improvements, which had a carrying value of approximately $2.2 million and $2.3 million as of December 31, 2005 and June 30, 2005, respectively.            During November 2005, we obtained financing denominated in British Pounds of
approximately $84,000 for the purchase of certain laboratory equipment. Outstanding borrowings under this arrangement bear interest at an effective rate of 7.92%. Following an initial payment of principal and interest of approximately $15,000,
principal and interest payments are payable in 33 monthly installments on a stepped reducing balance basis; nine payments of approximately $3,700, twelve payments of approximately $2,200 and twelve payments of $1,500. The outstanding balance on
this borrowing was approximately $65,000 as of December 31, 2005.             NOTE F   CAPITAL STOCK             On
August 31, 2004, Viragen contributed to capital $1,000,000 in inter-company balances with Viragen International. On that date, the closing price of our common stock was $0.18 per share as quoted on the over-the-counter bulletin board. Viragen
received 5,555,556 shares of our common stock for the capital contribution. This contribution increased Viragen s ownership of our outstanding common stock to approximately 81.2%.            In connection with the acquisition of ViraNative discussed in Note D, the former shareholders of ViraNative are entitled to
additional shares of Viragen International common stock contingent upon the attainment of certain milestones related to regulatory approvals:         

8,799,570 additional shares when and if a Mutual Recognition Procedures application is filed and receives approval from the requisite national and European Union regulatory
authorities for the use, sale and marketing of  Multiferon             in certain countries,
which must include Germany; and           

2,933,190 additional shares when and if  Multiferon             has been approved by the requisite regulatory bodies in the European Union for the treatment of Melanoma or when  Multiferon             has been approved by the requisite regulatory bodies for sale in the United States of America.              If and as each of these milestones is met, additional shares of Viragen
International will be issued.

Medicore, Inc. entered into a royalty agreement with respect to interferon, transfer factor and products using interferon and transfer factor in November 1986. The agreement was subsequently amended in November 1989 and May 1993. The amended
agreement provides for a maximum cap on royalties to be paid to Medicore of $2,400,000. It includes a schedule of royalty payments of:         

These royalties are to be paid until the total of $2,400,000 is achieved. The amended agreement also states that royalties of approximately $108,000
previously accrued by Viragen, Inc. prior to May 1993 under the agreement are payable to Medicore as the final payment. From May 1993 through September 2001, Viragen, Inc. paid royalties under the amended agreement totaling approximately $70,000.
           Royalties owed to Medicore of approximately $90,000, based on
our natural human alpha interferon sales from October 1, 2001 through June 30, 2003, were payable in three installments: $30,000 was payable by August 1, 2003; $30,000 was payable by August 1, 2004; and $30,000 was payable by
August 1, 2005. The three installments totaling $90,000, plus $4,500 in interest, have been made. Subsequent to June 30, 2003, in accordance with the terms of the amended agreement, royalties are paid to Medicore based on sales of natural
human alpha interferon on a quarterly basis. For the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, royalties due under the agreement totaled approximately $6,000 and $2,000, respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2005 and
2004, royalties due under the agreement totaled approximately $10,000 and $4,000, respectively.             NOTE H   COMPREHENSIVE LOSS             Comprehensive loss is comprised of our net loss and other comprehensive (loss) income. Other comprehensive (loss) income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States are included in comprehensive loss but are excluded from net loss as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders  deficit. Our other comprehensive (loss) income consists of foreign currency
translation adjustments. The following table sets forth the computation of comprehensive loss for the periods indicated:

    VIRAGEN INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES        NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)        (Unaudited)              NOTE I  
TRANSACTIONS WITH PARENT             Viragen provides certain
administrative services to us including management and general corporate assistance. Viragen also incurs certain costs attributable to us including insurance, rent and professional services. These expenses are charged on the basis of direct usage,
when identifiable, or on the basis of estimated time spent. We believe that the expenses allocated to Viragen International are representative of the operating expenses incurred by Viragen on our behalf. However, the financial information included
herein may not reflect the consolidated financial statements of Viragen International had we operated as a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2005, expenses allocated by
Viragen totaled approximately $312,000 and $650,000, respectively. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2004, expenses allocated by Viragen totaled approximately $343,000 and $690,000, respectively.            Viragen (Scotland) conducts research and development and performs
administrative functions on behalf of Viragen. These costs incurred by Viragen (Scotland) relate to oncology and avian transgenic projects and are allocated to Viragen as incurred. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2005, research
and development costs charged to Viragen totaled approximately $523,000 and $1,009,000, respectively, compared to approximately $386,000 and $733,000 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2004, respectively. The amount of
administrative expenses charged to Viragen was nil and approximately $6,000 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2005, respectively, compared to approximately $25,000 and $70,000 for the three and six months ended December 31,
2004, respectively. These expenses charged to Viragen are offset against the respective line items in our statements of operations. In fiscal 2005, Viragen (Scotland) began charging an administrative fee to Viragen based on a percentage of the
expenses charged to Viragen. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2005, this amount totaled approximately $48,000 and $86,000, respectively, compared to approximately $7,000 and $14,000 for the three and six months ended
December 31, 2004, respectively. This income has been recorded in the other income line item of our statements of operations.            During the quarter ended December 31, 2004 we recorded a $596,000 gain on the remeasurement of a liability to Viragen, Inc. by Viragen (Scotland),
which was denominated in U.S. dollars. This amount has been recorded in the other income line item of our statement of operations. In prior periods, this liability had been translated at historical exchange rates since this liability was determined
to be long-term in nature. This determination was based on the fact that Viragen (Scotland) did not have the ability or intent to repay the liability to Viragen. Beginning in fiscal 2002, Viragen (Scotland) began gradually settling the liability by
charging Viragen, Inc. for services performed on their behalf. Management anticipates the liability will be settled through these charges in the near term. Therefore, it was determined that the account should no longer be considered long-term and
thus translation at current exchange rates is appropriate. Since the liability was denominated in U.S. dollars and the Pound Sterling had been strengthening against the U.S. dollar over the last few years, the remeasurement of the liability
resulted in a gain. Had the determination been made when Viragen (Scotland) began settling the liability with charges to Viragen in prior periods and the liability been remeasured at then current exchange rates, the impact on the statements of
operations would not have been material and there would have been no effect on total stockholders  equity as such currency gains are reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income.

CONTRIBUTION             During the quarter ended December 31,
2004, we received a contribution in the amount of $278,000 from a business development agency in Sweden. This contribution was awarded in connection with our capital investment in our renovated facility in Ume , Sweden, which was completed
during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2004. This contribution was recorded as a reduction of the cost of the building improvements. We could be required to repay a portion of this contribution if we do not meet certain conditions under the
award, including, but not limited to, keeping the facility in operation. The amount we could be required to repay decreases on an annual basis beginning in July 2005. After July 2005, we could only be required to repay 70% of the award. Upon the
second, third and fourth anniversaries, the repayment amount decreases to 45%, 25% and 10%, respectively, of the award. At this time, we have no reason to believe we will be required to repay any portion of the contribution.             NOTE K   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS             In November 2004, the FASB issued FASB SFAS No. 151,  Inventory
Costs - an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 . SFAS No. 151 amends ARB 43, Chapter 4, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) should be
recognized as current-period charges. Historically, we have expensed such costs as incurred. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the
production facilities. The provisions of SFAS No. 151 are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 151 as of the beginning of our 2006 fiscal
year, which commenced July 1, 2005, did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.            In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,  Accounting Changes and Error Corrections   a replacement for APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB
Statement No. 3 . SFAS No. 154 provides guidance on accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. It requires prior period financial statements to be restated for voluntary changes in accounting principles.
SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We have no plans to adopt a voluntary change in accounting principle and believe that the adoption of SFAS
No. 154 will not have an effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations              Introduction             We are engaged in the research, development, manufacture, and sale of a natural human alpha interferon product indicated for treatment of a broad range of
viral and malignant diseases. We produce a natural human alpha interferon product under the tradename of  Multiferon             from human white blood cells, also known as leukocytes. Natural alpha interferon is one of the body s most important natural defense mechanisms to foreign substances like viruses, but it also
stimulates and modulates the human immune system.            We are a
majority owned subsidiary of Viragen, Inc. (Viragen) (AMEX: VRA). As of December 31, 2005, Viragen owned 59,818,301 shares of our common stock representing approximately 81.2% of our 73,669,320 outstanding shares. We operate through our foreign
wholly owned subsidiaries, ViraNative AB ( ViraNative ), a company located in Ume , Sweden and Viragen (Scotland) Limited ( Viragen (Scotland) ), a company located near Edinburgh, Scotland. ViraNative and Viragen (Scotland)
house our manufacturing and research laboratory facilities.             Cautionary
Factors That May Affect Future Results             This document and
other documents we may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission contain forward-looking statements. Also, our management may make forward-looking statements orally to investors, analysts, the media and others.            Forward-looking statements express our expectations or predictions of future
events or results. They are not guarantees and are subject to many risks and uncertainties. There are a number of factors many beyond our control that could cause actual events or results to be significantly different from those described
in the forward-looking statement. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this report or in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong.            Forward-looking statements might include one or more of the following:         

anticipated debt or equity fundings;           

projections of future revenue;           

anticipated clinical trial commencement dates, completion timelines or results;           

anticipated receipt of regulatory approvals;           

descriptions of plans or objectives of management for future operations, products or services;           

forecasts of future economic performance; and           

descriptions or assumptions underlying or relating to any of the above items.           
  Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as

   Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially include the risks and uncertainties discussed
below, as well as in the  Risk Factors  section included in our Prospectus (File No. 333-75998) filed on November 22, 2002 with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933. You
should read them. You should also read the risks and uncertainties identified from time to time in our reports on Forms 10-Q or 10-K and registration statements and amendments, if any. We will provide you with a copy of any or all of these
documents at no charge. Copies of these documents may also be obtained free of charge from our website at   www.viragen.com   and the Securities and Exchange Commission website at   www.sec.gov  . The information on our website
is neither incorporated into, nor a part of this report.            Our
business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by a number of risks and uncertainties, which could result in our having to curtail or possibly suspend or cease operations. These risks and
uncertainties include the following:         

whether we are able to secure sufficient funding to maintain our operations, complete clinical trials, successfully market our product and otherwise continue as a going concern;

whether the efficacy, production, price and timing of approvals of our natural human alpha interferon will enable us to compete with other well established, highly capitalized,
biopharmaceutical companies;           

whether our patent applications result in the issuance of patents, or whether patents and other intellectual property rights provide adequate protections in the event of
misappropriation or infringement by third parties;           

whether clinical testing confirms the efficacy of our product, and results in the receipt of regulatory approvals. We have not sought the approval of our natural human alpha
interferon product from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or its European Union counterparts, except Sweden;           

whether, despite achievement of regulatory approvals, our products are accepted as a treatment superior to that of our competitors;           

whether we are able to service our indebtedness and/or repay indebtedness as and when due, and otherwise meet our obligations to our lenders; and           

whether we can generate revenue sufficient to offset our historical losses and achieve profitability.              Our natural human alpha interferon product was developed and is manufactured overseas in our Swedish facility. Our
dependence on foreign manufacturing and expected international sales exposes us to a number of risks, including:         

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;           

tariffs and other trade barriers, including import and export restrictions;           

political or economic instability;           

compliance with foreign laws;           

transportation delays and interruptions;           

difficulties in protecting intellectual property rights in foreign countries; and           

currency exchange risks.

    Recent Developments             We have met with the regulatory authorities in Sweden on multiple occasions to answer questions regarding our application seeking to expand the approval
for  Multiferon           to include the first-line
adjuvant treatment of high-risk malignant melanoma, in Sweden, following dacarbazine (DTIC) after surgical removal of tumors. We believe that we have provided satisfactory responses and expect a final decision in the very
near-term. Assuming we receive final approval for this important indication in Sweden, we are prepared to launch this new indication immediately.            On December 6, 2005, we announced that we entered into a license agreement with Kuhnil Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd. headquartered in Seoul, Korea to
distribute  Multiferon           in South Korea.
Kuhnil is a rapidly growing, leading manufacturer, developer and marketer of pharmaceuticals in Korea with a specialty focus in oncology, covering an expansive network of clinics, physicians and hospitals with over 300 sales representatives. Kuhnil
is a privately-held company established in 1951 in Seoul, South Korea.            We received a small up-front license fee in exchange for providing exclusive marketing rights to  Multiferon           in South Korea for a period of ten years. The agreement provides that Kuhnil shall take all measures necessary to achieve regulatory approval for
 Multiferon           in South Korea, as required by
the Korean health regulatory authority, KFDA. The South Korean regulatory approval process is expected to take approximately 12 months.            On November 18, 2005, we announced that preliminary in vitro studies conducted by a U.S. research organization found  Multiferon           to show significant anti-viral activity against the
highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus. These early-stage studies found  Multiferon           to be significantly more active against the virus than recombinant alpha interferon, recombinant beta interferon or ribavirin. We believe these results suggest that
 Multiferon           may have utility against this
viral threat and is a prime candidate worthy of further evaluation in additional avian influenza studies.            The studies were conducted by Birmingham, Alabama-based Southern Research Institute, an independent, not-for-profit center for scientific research. In the
evaluations, Southern Research exposed a standard cell line to a range of concentrations of  Multiferon          , recombinant alpha interferon, recombinant beta interferon and ribavirin, all of which were then separately exposed to the H5N1 avian influenza virus. It was found that not only was
 Multiferon           highly active against the virus,
being able to protect the cells against viral infection, but furthermore, it was found to be far more active than the other three products tested.  Multiferon           showed potent anti-viral efficacy at low concentrations and was non-toxic to the cells.            While these studies represent only a preliminary evaluation, and success in
the in vivo or clinical stages cannot be guaranteed, the data suggests that  Multiferon           may have immuno-protective and anti-viral activity against this particular strain of virus, and furthermore, may be more effective than other anti-viral products, including recombinant
alpha interferon.            The data obtained from these studies has
been included to supplement Viragen s provisional patent application filed with the United Kingdom s Patent Office in February 2005, which was subsequently filed as an International Patent Application in February 2006 and which replaced
the previously filed provisional patent application filed in February 2004 covering the use of natural, multi-subtype alpha interferon for human treatment and prevention of avian influenza virus.

    Critical Accounting Policies             Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventories, depreciation, amortization, asset
valuation allowances and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect
our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.         

Inventories.  Inventories consist of raw materials and supplies, work in process and finished product. Finished product consists of purified natural human alpha interferon
that is available for sale. Cost of raw materials and supplies are determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Costs of work in process and finished product, consisting of raw materials, labor and overhead are recorded at a standard cost (which
approximates actual cost). Excess/idle capacity costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred and are recorded in cost of sales. Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (estimated net realizable value). If the cost of
our inventories exceeds their expected market value, provisions are recorded currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. These provisions are determined based on estimates. The valuation of our inventories also requires us to
estimate excess inventories and inventories that are not saleable. The determination of excess or non-saleable inventories requires us to estimate the future demand for our product and consider the shelf life of the inventory. If actual demand is
less than our estimated demand, we could be required to record inventory write-downs, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations.           

Long-lived assets . In accordance with SFAS No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,  we review our long-lived assets, including
intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value
of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flows. If these estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the asset s estimated
fair value and its carrying value. As of the date of these financial statements, we are not aware of any items or events that would cause us to adjust the recorded value of our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment.

Goodwill.  In accordance with SFAS No. 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,  goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis
or sooner if indicators of impairment arise. Management has selected April 1   st    as the date of our annual
impairment review. All of our goodwill arose from the acquisition of ViraNative on September 28, 2001 and the subsequent achievement of certain milestones defined in the acquisition agreement. We periodically evaluate that acquired business for
potential impairment indicators. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors, market conditions, and the operational performance of the acquired business. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we
completed our annual impairment review of our goodwill. The impairment review indicated that our goodwill was impaired and, as a result, an impairment charge of approximately $6.9 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.
Changes in the estimates used to conduct our impairment review, including revenue projections or market values, could cause our analysis to indicate that our goodwill is further impaired in subsequent periods and result in a write-off of a portion
or all of our goodwill.

Revenue recognition . We recognize revenue from sales of our natural human alpha interferon product when title and risk of loss has been transferred, which is generally upon
shipment. Moreover, recognition requires persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, the price is fixed and determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.           
   20   

Table of Contents  

    Liquidity and Capital Resources             We are currently dependent upon advances by Viragen, Inc., our parent company, and to a lesser extent, revenue generated
from the sale of our natural human alpha interferon product, to fund our operations. Our operating losses and working capital requirements continue to adversely affect cash flow. Historically, Viragen has provided us with the working capital
necessary to fund operations. Viragen has sufficient capital on hand to fund their operations through February 2006 and has agreed to provide us with the working capital necessary to fund our operations through February 2006. Viragen will require
substantial additional funding to support our operations subsequent to February 2006. As we do not anticipate achieving sufficient cash flows from our operations, we will be dependent upon Viragen for additional funding. Viragen is seeking
additional capital through equity and debt financings. No assurance can be given that additional capital will be available when required or upon terms acceptable to Viragen. Viragen s or our inability to obtain additional capital through equity
or debt financings, or generate substantial revenue, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to continue operations. Accordingly, if Viragen or we are unable to obtain additional financing by the end of
February 2006, we could be forced to significantly curtail or suspend our operations, including laying-off employees, recording asset impairment write-downs and other measures.            As a result of these financial conditions, the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our
June 30, 2005 consolidated financial statements includes an explanatory paragraph indicating that these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated condensed financial statements for the
three and six month periods ended December 31, 2005 do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of
these uncertainties.            For the six months ended
December 31, 2005, our funding primarily consisted of net advances from our parent company totaling approximately $3.26 million. At December 31, 2005, cash on hand totaled approximately $599,000 and working capital totaled approximately
$1.79 million, a decrease of approximately $470,000 when compared to working capital of approximately $2.26 million as of June 30, 2005. Cash used to fund operations during the six months ended December 31, 2005 totaled approximately $2.89
million.            During the six months ended December 31, 2005 we
made capital investments of approximately $336,000 for equipment and renovations at our Swedish subsidiary as well as research and development equipment at our Scottish subsidiary. The equipment purchases and renovations at our Swedish subsidiary,
which are ongoing, were necessary to replace or modernize certain portions of our production and administrative facilities. We expect to spend an additional $100,000 on equipment and renovations at these facilities to bring the project to
completion.            Our future cash requirements are dependent upon
many factors, including:         

revenue generated from the sale of our natural human alpha interferon product;           

progress with future clinical trials;           

the costs associated with obtaining regulatory approvals;           

the costs involved in patent applications;           

competing technologies and market developments; and           

our ability to establish collaborative arrangements and effective commercialization activities.              For the remainder of fiscal 2006, we anticipate the need of approximately $4.0 million for operating activities, $100,000 for investing
activities and $60,000 to service our long-term financing obligations other than with our parent, Viragen.

   Our Swedish subsidiary maintains an overdraft facility, denominated in Swedish Krona, with a bank in
Sweden. In July 2004, the terms of this overdraft facility were renegotiated to provide for a reduced interest rate and a reduction in the maximum borrowing capacity. The maximum borrowing capacity on this overdraft facility was approximately
$710,000 as of December 31, 2005 compared to $767,000 at June 30, 2005. Borrowings outstanding under this overdraft facility are at a floating rate of interest, which was approximately 5.25% at December 31, 2005 and June 30,
2005. The overdraft facility was renewed in December 2005 and will expire at the end of February 2006. There was no outstanding balance under this overdraft facility as of December 31, 2005 or June 30, 2005. This overdraft facility is
secured by certain assets of ViraNative including inventories and accounts receivable.            We believe that our natural human alpha interferon product can be manufactured in sufficient quantity and be priced at a level that is competitive in most markets. However, we can not assure you of the success of our
commercialization efforts and other projects. Required regulatory approvals are subject to the successful completion of lengthy and costly clinical trials. The successful commercialization of  Multiferon             and the completion of required clinical trials and facility expansions depend on continued funding from Viragen,
Viragen s ability to secure significant additional funding and our ability to eventually generate sufficient cash flows from operations.             Off Balance Sheet Arrangements             Under SEC regulations, we are required to disclose any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future
effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. An off-balance sheet arrangement means a
transaction, agreement or contractual arrangement to which any entity that is not consolidated with us is a party, under which we have:         

Any obligation under certain guarantee contracts;     

Any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity
for such assets;           

Any obligation under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument, except that it is both indexed to our stock and classified in stockholders  equity in
our statement of financial position; and           

Any obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or
engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.              As of the date of this report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that we are required to disclose pursuant to these regulations. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into operating lease
commitments, purchase commitments and other contractual obligations. These transactions are recognized in our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

    Recent Accounting Pronouncements             In November 2004, the FASB issued FASB SFAS No. 151,  Inventory Costs - an Amendment of ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4 . SFAS No. 151 amends ARB 43, Chapter 4, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current-period charges.
Historically, we have expensed such costs as incurred. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of
SFAS No. 151 are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 151 as of the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year, which commenced July 1, 2005,
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.            In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,  Accounting Changes and Error Corrections   a replacement for APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3 . SFAS No. 154 provides guidance
on accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. It requires prior period financial statements to be restated for voluntary changes in accounting principles. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and
corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We have no plans to adopt a voluntary change in accounting principle and believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 154 will not have an effect on the Company s
consolidated financial statements.

    Results of Operations              Product sales             For the three months ended December 31, 2005, product sales totaled approximately $117,000 compared to approximately $53,000 for the three months
ended December 31, 2004. For the six months ended December 31, 2005, product sales totaled approximately $202,000 compared to approximately $83,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2004. These increases in product sales are
attributed to an increase in  Multiferon             sales volume in Mexico, Sweden, Germany
and Indonesia.            We have entered into several agreements for the
distribution of our natural human alpha interferon,  Multiferon            , in various
countries. To date, we have not recognized revenue from many of these agreements. The majority of these agreements require that the distributor obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, which, in many cases, have not yet been obtained. Regulatory
approval is a mandatory step in the marketing of a drug, but it is by no means the final challenge in marketing a biopharmaceutical product.  Multiferon             is a critical care product. Therefore, in certain instances, it must be part of a territory s approved formulary to enable
physicians to prescribe the product, which may include becoming approved within a nationalized network of hospitals. Also, the physicians must be educated as to the benefits of the product.            There are other challenges associated with international marketing activities
including: language and cultural barriers, in some cases poorly organized regulatory infrastructure and/or compliance procedures in certain countries where  Multiferon             may be marketed, performance of our distribution channels, government s willingness to promote cheaper generic products and the
general population s inability to afford private care drug products. It will take significant time to overcome these challenges with no assurance that a particular market will ever be effectively penetrated.             Cost of Sales             Cost of sales, which includes excess/idle production costs, totaled approximately $570,000 for the three months ended
December 31, 2005 compared to approximately $754,000 for the same period in the prior year. Cost of sales totaled approximately $1,027,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2005 compared to approximately $1,231,000 for the same period
in the prior year. These decreases in cost of sales are primarily attributed to decreased excess/idle capacity as a result of cost cutting measures. Excess/idle capacity represents fixed production costs incurred at our Swedish manufacturing
facilities, which were not absorbed as a result of the production of inventory at less than normal operating levels. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2005, excess/idle capacity costs were primarily due to minimal production
activities as a result of low sales demand. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2004 excess/idle capacity costs were primarily the result of the suspension of routine manufacturing as of March 31, 2003. This planned break in
routine manufacturing was imposed by the Swedish regulatory authorities and was necessary to allow for certain steps of our production process to be segregated and transferred to our owned facility located in Ume , Sweden. We will continue to
incur excess/idle production costs until we generate higher sales demand and resume production at normal operating levels that absorb our fixed production costs.

    Inventory Write-down             During the quarter ended December 31, 2005, we determined that a portion of our work in process inventory would not be converted to finished product
prior to expiration. Therefore, we recorded a write-down for this inventory of approximately $104,000.            During the quarter ended September 30, 2005, a freezer at our facility in Sweden malfunctioned causing the temperature of certain work in process
inventory to rise above the approved levels for frozen product. Accordingly, we recorded a net write-down of approximately $91,000 of work in process inventory. This loss is net of an insurance recovery of approximately $486,000, which we collected
in October 2005.            During the quarter ended December 31,
2004, we recorded a write-down of approximately $540,000 of our finished product inventory. Upon evaluating the shelf-life of certain lots of our  Multiferon              inventory, near-term sales forecasts and consideration of
alternative uses, a write-down of the value of this inventory was deemed necessary.              Research and Development Costs             Research and development costs include scientific salaries and support fees, laboratory supplies, consulting fees, equipment rentals, repairs and maintenance, utilities and research related travel. Research and development costs for the
three months ended December 31, 2005 totaled approximately $403,000 compared to approximately $194,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2004. For the six months ended December 31, 2005, research and development costs totaled
approximately $787,000 compared to approximately $595,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2004. Research and development expenses during the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2004 reflect the reversal of a long-standing trade
liability of approximately $182,000. Excluding the impact of this reversal, period over period research and development expenses were slightly higher for the three and six months ended December 31, 2005 due to an increase in consulting fees for
regulatory matters and legal fees related to intellectual property.            We will continue incurring research and development costs, including projects associated with Multiferon            as well as other projects to more fully develop potential commercial applications of our natural human alpha interferon product and related technologies. We anticipate expenditures to increase over the next twelve months,
particularly in the area of regulatory-related consulting fees and clinical trial costs. Our ability to successfully conclude additional clinical trials, a prerequisite for expanded commercialization of any product, is dependent upon Viragen s
continued funding of our operations, our ability to independently raise significant additional funding, or our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations.             Selling, General and Administrative Expenses             Selling, general and administrative expenses include administrative personnel salaries and related expenses, office and
equipment leases, utilities, insurance, legal, accounting, consulting, depreciation and amortization. For the three months ended December 31, 2005, selling, general and administrative expenses totaled approximately $983,000 compared to
approximately $1,136,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2004. Included in these amounts were selling, general and administrative expenses allocated by Viragen, our parent company, which totaled approximately $312,000 and $343,000 for
the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in the allocated amount was primarily due to a reduction is salaries and related expenses attributable to us. During the current year, we also experienced a decrease
in consulting and legal fees.         
   25   

Table of Contents  

   For the six months ended December 31, 2005, selling, general and administrative expenses totaled
approximately $2,043,000 compared to approximately $2,194,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2004. Included in these amounts were selling, general and administrative expenses allocated by Viragen, our parent company, which totaled
approximately $650,000 and $685,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. The decrease in the allocated amount was primarily due to a reduction is salaries and related expenses attributable to us.
During the current year, we also experienced a decrease in consulting and legal fees.            Our successful commercialization of Multiferon            will
require additional marketing and promotional activities, which is dependent upon Viragen s continued funding of our operations, our ability to independently raise significant additional funding, or our ability to generate sufficient cash flow
from operations.            We anticipate that selling related expenses
will increase in the second half of fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. This expected increase is mainly due to the planned expansion of our  Multiferon             sales efforts. These increases will be incurred in sales personnel related expenses, consulting fees, travel related expenses,
promotional materials and other marketing related costs.             Amortization of
Intangible Assets             Amortization of intangible assets
represents the amortization of our acquired developed technology. This developed technology is being amortized over its estimated useful life of approximately 14 years. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2005, amortization of
intangible assets totaled approximately $38,000 and $77,000, respectively, compared to approximately $44,000 and $84,000 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2004, respectvely. The period over period decreases are due to the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Swedish Krona.             Interest
Expense             Interest expense consists of interest incurred on
the debt facilities maintained by our Swedish and Scottish subsidiaries. These debt facilities have interest rates ranging from 5.25% to 7.92%. Interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2005 totaled approximately $9,000 down from
approximately $14,000 for three months ended December 31, 2004. This decrease is primarily due to a reduction in the interest rate and average outstanding balance on our line of credit in Sweden.            Interest expense for the six months ended December 31, 2005 totaled
approximately $19,000 down from approximately $64,000 for six months ended December 31, 2004. This decrease is due to the repayment in September 2004 of one of our loans that carried a high interest rate and a reduction in the interest rate and
average outstanding balance on our line of credit in Sweden. We expect interest expense will increase for the remainder of fiscal 2006 if we are required to borrow under our line of credit in Sweden, which is anticipated, or obtain additional debt.

    Other Income, Net             The primary components of other income, net, are interest earned on cash and cash equivalents, sub-lease income on certain office space in our facility in
Scotland, transaction and remeasurement gains or losses on foreign exchange, gains or losses on the disposal of property and equipment, and income generated from research and development support services provided by our Swedish subsidiary.
           For the three months ended December 31, 2005, other
income, net, totaled approximately $88,000 compared to other income, net, of approximately $664,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2004. This decrease of approximately $576,000 is primarily due to the $596,000 remeasurement gain
(discussed below) recorded during the quarter ended December 31, 2004. This gain was partially offset by an increase in the markup on charges to Viragen for administrative and research and development services performed on their behalf.
           For the six months ended December 31, 2005, other income,
net, totaled approximately $177,000 compared to other income, net, of approximately $708,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2004. This decrease of approximately $531,000 is primarily due to the $596,000 remeasurement gain (discussed
below) recorded during the quarter ended December 31, 2004. This gain was partially offset by an increase in the markup on charges to Viragen for administrative and research and development services performed on their behalf.            During the quarter ended December 31, 2004 we recorded a $596,000 gain
on the remeasurement of a liability to Viragen, Inc. by Viragen (Scotland), which was denominated in U.S. dollars. In prior periods, this liability had been translated at historical exchange rates since this liability was determined to be long-term
in nature. This determination was based on the fact that Viragen (Scotland) did not have the ability or intent to repay the liability to Viragen. In recent periods, Viragen (Scotland) has been gradually settling the liability by charging Viragen,
Inc. for services performed on their behalf. Management anticipates the liability will be settled through these charges in the near term. Therefore, it was determined that the account should no longer be considered long-term and thus translation at
current exchange rates is appropriate. Since the liability was denominated in U.S. dollars and the Pound Sterling has been strengthening against the U.S. dollar over the last few years, the remeasurement of the liability resulted in a gain. Had
the determination been made when Viragen (Scotland) began settling the liability with charges to Viragen in prior periods and the liability been remeasured at then current exchange rates, the impact on the statements of operations would not have
been material and there would have been no effect on stockholders  equity as such currency gains are reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income.             Income Tax Benefit             We are subject to tax in the United States, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. These jurisdictions have different marginal tax rates. For the three and six
months ended December 31, 2005, our income tax benefits totaled approximately $11,000 and $22,000, respectively, which was the same as for the three and six months ended December 31, 2004. Income tax benefits for these periods arose from
the amortization expense on certain intangible assets. Due to the treatment of the identifiable intangible assets under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes , our balance sheet reflects a
deferred income tax liability of approximately $435,000 as of December 31, 2005, all of which is related to our developed technology intangible asset acquired on September 28, 2001.            As of June 30, 2005, we had net operating loss carry-forwards of
approximately $7.5 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes expiring between 2006 and 2025. Approximately $1.6 million of this amount will expire by the year 2011. These losses may be used to offset taxable income, if any, during those periods.
Our ability to generate revenue and net income during future periods is dependent upon obtaining regulatory         
   27   

Table of Contents  

   approvals for further commercialization of  Multiferon            . Based on our accumulated losses, a full valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that will
more likely than not be realized. At June 30, 2005, Viragen (Scotland) and ViraNative had net operating loss carry-forwards totaling approximately $25.8 million and $13.8 million, respectively.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk             Market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations
in interest rates and market prices. We have not traded or otherwise transacted in derivatives nor do we expect to do so in the future. We have established policies and internal processes related to the management of market risks which we use in the
normal course of our business operations.             Interest Rate Risk
            The fair value of long-term debt is subject to interest
rate risk. While changes in market interest rates may affect the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt, we believe a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition, future results of operations or cash
flows.             Foreign Currency Exchange Risk             We conduct operations in several different countries. The balance sheet
accounts of our operations in Scotland and Sweden, including intercompany accounts that are considered long-term in nature, are translated to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes and resulting adjustments are made to stockholders 
equity. The value of the respective local currency may strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, which would impact the value of stockholders  investment in our common stock. Fluctuations in the value of the British Pound and Swedish Krona
against the U.S. dollar have occurred during our history, which have resulted in unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and shown in the equity section of our balance
sheet. Intercompany trading accounts, which are short-term in nature, are remeasured at current exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates and any gains or losses are recorded in other income.            While most of the transactions of our U.S. and foreign operations are
denominated in the respective local currency, some transactions are denominated in other currencies. Transactions denominated in other currencies are accounted for in the respective local currency at the time of the transaction. Upon settlement of
this type of transaction, any foreign currency gain or loss results in an adjustment to income.            Our results of operations may be impacted by the fluctuating exchange rates of foreign currencies, especially the British Pound and Swedish Krona, in
relation to the U.S. dollar. Most of the revenue and expense items of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the respective local currencies. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these local currencies will result in lower revenue,
expenses, assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries, when translated into U.S. dollars. During the six months ended December 31, 2005, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the British Pound and the Swedish Krona by approximately 4.7%
and 1.6%, respectively.            We do not currently engage in hedging
activities with respect to our foreign currency exposure. However, we continually monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations. We have not incurred significant realized losses on exchange transactions. If realized losses on foreign transactions
were to become significant, we would evaluate appropriate strategies, including the possible use of foreign exchange contracts, to reduce such losses.            We were not adversely impacted by the European Union s adoption of the  Euro  currency. Our foreign operations to date have been located in
Scotland and Sweden, which have not participated in the adoption of the Euro as of December 31, 2005.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures              Disclosure Controls and Procedures Evaluation and Related CEO and CFO Certifications             We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered
by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The controls evaluation was done under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO).            Attached as exhibits to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are certifications
of the CEO and the CFO, which are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act. This Item 4, Controls and Procedures, includes the information concerning the controls evaluation referred to in the certifications and it should be
read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.             Definition of Disclosure Controls and Procedures             Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures include components of our internal control over financial reporting, which
consists of control processes designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
            Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls             Our management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our
disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
control.            The design of any system of controls is based in part
upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in any control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Table of Contents  

    Conclusions             Based upon the controls evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, subject to the limitations noted above, as of the end of the period covered by
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that material information relating to Viragen International and its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to management,
including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.             Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting             There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2005 that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
