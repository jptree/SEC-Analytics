In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Statements (SFAS) No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation."  This standard requires either the recognition or disclosure
of compensation expense based on the fair value of equity instruments granted
to employees.  As permitted by SFAS 123, the Registrant has elected to adopt
the disclosure provisions of the standard in 1997 when required.

Note H - Earnings (Loss) Per Share:

Earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing net earnings or (loss) by
common shares outstanding and common stock equivalents.  Outstanding options
did not have a material dilutive effect on earnings per share for the
thirteen week periods ended December 1, 1996 and December 3, 1995.

Note I - Chino, California Facility:

In February 1994, the Registrant leased the land and building at the Chino
California facility for a five year period at an annual net rental of
$297,000; the lessee was also granted the option to purchase the land and
building during the lease period for $2,900,000.  
                                        
Note J - Property, Plant and Equipment Held for Sale:

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995 Registrant decided to dispose of its
Washington, Georgia dyeing and finishing plant and has been actively
searching for a buyer; manufacturing operations ceased October 6, 1995. 
Registrant provided for estimated expenses during the disposition period in
its fiscal year ended September 3, 1995 and estimates that the net proceeds
of sale will approximate the facility's depreciated cost.

OPERATIONS - Thirteen Weeks Ended December 1, 1996 Compared With Thirteen
Weeks Ended December 3, 1995.

Fabric sales decreased by 21.2%.  The decline was attributable to the planned
de-emphasis, originated in fiscal 1996, of the production of fabrics for sale
to the apparel trade.  This resulted in lower unit sales and, as anticipated,
somewhat lower average selling prices. 

Gross profit margin increased from 26.5% in fiscal 1996 to 29.9% in fiscal
1997 primarily due to Registrant's elimination of its less profitable product
ranges and the implementation of its strategy to focus on the more profitable
aspects of its business (Concord House and knitted fabrics).

Merchandising expenses declined by 22.2% as a result of a reduction in
personnel associated with the production of woven fabrics for the apparel
trade. 

Selling and shipping expenses declined by 16.3% as a result of the decrease
in Registrant's sales.  The decrease was less than the actual sales decrease
because some of Registrant's selling expenses do not vary with sales but
represent sales management costs which are more fixed in nature.

General and administrative expenses declined by 15.6% as a result of 1) a
reduction in personnel and related costs as Registrant's activities became
more focused and 2) the administrative savings associated with the shut-down
of Registrant's Washington, Georgia manufacturing facility during the first
quarter of fiscal 1996.

Interest expense declined by 36.3% as Registrant generated cash flow from its
planned reduction of business activity which stemmed from the elimination of
unprofitable product ranges.  Short term debt was eliminated and Registrant
generated interest income from cash invested in marketable short term
securities.

Earnings before income taxes for the thirteen weeks of fiscal 1997 were
$932,000 compared with $270,000 for the thirteen weeks of fiscal 1996.  Net
earnings were $543,000 for 1997 and $133,000 for 1996.  Registrant's 1997
results are consistent with its expectation that its recently implemented
strategy would generate improved earnings. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

During the first thirteen weeks of fiscal 1997, Registrant's operations
provided $3,411,000 cash.  $373,000 was used to acquire machinery and
equipment.  Cash increased by $3,076,000 during the period.  Working captial
increased by $826,000 for the thirteen weeks ended December 1, 1996. 
Registrant's improved liquidity is attributable to the elimination of certain
product ranges and the resultant reduction in accounts receivable and 

                                                                 11 of 14

operations to be adequate to finance operations and meet its cash
requirements for fiscal 1997.
