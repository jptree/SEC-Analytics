Synergetics USA, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

Note 1. General 

Nature of business:  Synergetics USA, Inc. ( Synergetics USA  or the  Company ) is a Delaware
corporation incorporated on June 2, 2005 in connection with the merger of Synergetics, Inc.
( Synergetics ) and Valley Forge Scientific Corp. ( Valley Forge ) and the subsequent
reincorporation of Valley Forge (the predecessor to Synergetics USA) in Delaware. The Company is
located in O Fallon, Missouri and King of Prussia, Pennsylvania and is engaged in the manufacture
and worldwide sale of microsurgical instruments, capital equipment and devices primarily for use in
vitreoretinal surgery and neurosurgical applications. During the ordinary course of its business,
the Company grants unsecured credit to its domestic and international customers.

Reporting period:  The Company s year end is July 31 of each calendar year. For interim
periods, the Company uses a 21 business day per month reporting cycle. As such, the information
presented in the Form 10-Q is for the three and six month periods October 28, 2005 through January
30, 2006, August 1, 2005 through January 30, 2006, October 29, 2004 through January 31, 2005 and
August 1, 2004 through January 31, 2005, respectively. As such, the three month period contains 63
business days and the six month period contains 126 business days.

Basis of presentation:  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Synergetics USA, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries: Synergetics, Synergetics
Development Company, LLC and Synergetics IP, Inc. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article
10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by
generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring items) considered necessary for a fair
presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and six months ended January 30,
2006 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending July
31, 2006. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended July 31, 2005,
and notes thereto filed with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on October 31, 2005 (the  Annual Report ).

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The Company s significant accounting policies are disclosed in the Annual Report. With the
exception of the following, the Company s significant accounting policies have not materially
changed as of January 30, 2006.

Principles of consolidation:  Through the date of the reverse merger described in Note 3, the
condensed consolidated financial statements included the accounts of Synergetics and its wholly
owned subsidiaries: Synergetics Development Company, LLC and an 83 percent owned subsidiary,
Synergetics Laser, LLC. Thereafter, the condensed consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Synergetics USA, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries: Synergetics, Synergetics IP,
Inc. and Synergetics Development Company, LLC. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.

Property and equipment:  Leasehold improvements are being amortized over the related lease term
or estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter.

Goodwill and other intangibles:  Absent any impairment indicators, goodwill is tested for
impairment on an annual basis. The Company expects to perform its goodwill impairment tests during
the fourth fiscal quarter. Other intangible assets, consisting of patents, licensing agreements and
proprietary know-how are amortized to operations under the straight-line method over their
estimated useful lives or statutory lives whichever is shorter. These periods range from two to ten
years. The life of a trademark is inextricably related to the life of the product bearing the mark
or the life of the business entity owning the trademark. The Company intends to use the trademark
indefinitely, and therefore, its useful life is not limited to any specific product. The trademark
constitutes an indefinite-lived intangible that will be used in perpetuity.

Revenue recognition:  The Company records revenue from product sales when the revenue is
realized and the product is shipped from its facilities. This includes satisfying the following
criteria: the arrangement with the customer is evident, usually through the

6

Table of Contents   

receipt of a purchase order; the sales price is fixed and determinable; delivery has occurred;
and collectibility is reasonably ensured. Freight and shipping billed to customers is included in
net sales, and the cost of shipping is included in cost of sales.

Service revenue substantially relates to repairs of products and is recognized when the
service has been completed. Revenue from license and royalty fees is recorded when earned.

Stock-based compensation:  As of August 1, 2005, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
( SFAS ) No. 123 (Revised 2004),  Share-Based Payment  (SFAS123(R)), became effective for the
Company. The Company had previously followed Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
 Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation  ( APB No. 25 ), and related
interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options. Under APB No. 25, no compensation
expense was recognized, if the exercise price of the Company s employee stock options equaled or
exceeded the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant. Under SFAS 123(R),
compensation expense is now recognized. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant
date, based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the directors  and employees 
requisite service period. Compensation expense is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model. The Company has elected to use the modified prospective transition method. Under the
modified prospective transition method, an entity uses the fair values based accounting method for
all director and employee awards granted, modified or settled after the effective date. As of the
effective date, compensation costs related to the nonvested portion of awards outstanding as of
that date are based on the grant-date fair value of those awards as calculated under the original
provisions of SFAS 123  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  that is, an entity would not
remeasure the grant-date fair value estimate of the unvested portion of awards granted prior to the
effective date of SFAS 123(R).

Segment information:  The Synergetics segment includes revenue and operating expenses
associated with the sales of ophthalmic and neurosurgical instruments and Omni     
ultrasonic aspirator. The Valley Forge segment includes revenue and operating expenses associated
with the sales of bipolar electrosurgical generators. The financial results of Valley Forge have
been included from September 22, 2005 through January 30, 2006.

Note 3. Reverse Merger 

On September 21, 2005, Synergetics Acquisition Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Valley Forge, merged with and into Synergetics and Synergetics thereby became a wholly owned
subsidiary of Valley Forge. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, stockholders of
Synergetics common stock received in the aggregate 15,960,648 shares of Valley Forge common stock,
or 4.59 Valley Forge shares for each share of Synergetics resulting in Synergetics  former private
stockholders owning approximately 66 percent of Valley Forge s outstanding common stock upon
completion of the reverse merger. The reverse merger was accounted for as a purchase business
combination with Synergetics deemed the accounting acquirer and Valley Forge s assets acquired and
liabilities assumed recorded at fair value as follows:

The operations of Valley Forge have been consolidated from the acquisition date. The cost to
acquire Valley Forge has been preliminarily allocated to the Valley Forge assets acquired and
liabilities assumed according to their estimated fair values. The preliminary allocation, which
includes Synergetics transaction costs, resulted in acquired goodwill of $10,788,565, which is not
deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill amount will be adjusted in future periods upon the
settlement of certain contingencies which are yet to be finalized.

The unaudited pro forma results, assuming the reverse merger with Valley Forge had occurred at
the beginning of each fiscal period presented below, would have yielded the following results:

7

Table of Contents   

(1) 
       
     Prior to the reverse merger, Valley Forge had a fiscal year end of September 30 with quarterly
results reported on calendar quarters. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
statement of income for the six months ended January 31, 2005 was derived by adding the results of
the six months ended January 31, 2005 for Synergetics, Inc. and the results of the six months ended
December 31, 2004, for Valley Forge (which was derived by taking the results of the year ended
September 30, 2004 less the results of the nine months ended June 30, 2004 plus the results of the
three months ended December 31, 2004). 

These pro forma results include adjustments to give effect to interest expense of the
trademark-related debt and other purchase price adjustments. The pro forma results are not
necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred had the reverse merger
been consummated as of the beginning of each fiscal period, nor are they necessarily indicative of
future operating results.

Note 4. Distribution Agreements 

In connection with the reverse merger described in Note 3, the Company became a party to the
distribution agreements described below which are in addition to its pre-merger distribution
agreements:

Codman and Shurtleff, Inc. ( Codman ) 

In the neurosurgery market, the bipolar electrosurgical system manufactured by Valley Forge
prior to the merger has been sold for over 20 years through a series of distribution agreements
with Codman, an affiliate of Johnson   Johnson and formerly Valley Forge s largest customer. On
October 15, 2004, Valley Forge executed an agreement with Codman for the period October 1, 2004
through December 31, 2005. The agreement provided for exclusive worldwide distribution rights of
Valley Forge s existing neurosurgery products in the fields of neurocranial and neurospinal surgery
until March 31, 2005, and non-exclusive rights in these fields from April 1, 2005 through December
31, 2005. On May 6, 2005, in accordance with the terms of the agreement, Valley Forge notified
Codman that, effective July 15, 2005, Codman would be the non-exclusive worldwide distributor of
its existing products in the fields of neurocranial and neurospinal surgery until December 31,
2005. On January 9, 2006, the Company executed a new, three-year distribution agreement with Codman
for the continued distribution by Codman of certain bipolar generators and related disposables and
accessories. In addition, the Company entered into a new, three-year license agreement, which
provides for the continued licensing of Synergetics  Malis      trademark to Codman for use
with certain Codman products, including those covered by the distribution agreement.

Net sales to Codman amounted to approximately $1,747,000 for the period from September 22,
2005 to January 30, 2006. This represented 10.3 percent of net sales for the six months ended
January 30, 2006.

Stryker Corporation ( Stryker ) 

On October 25, 2004, Valley Forge executed a Supply and Distribution Agreement (the
 Agreement ) with Stryker, a Michigan corporation, which provides for the Company to supply to
Stryker and for Stryker to distribute exclusively, on a world-wide basis, a unique RF generator for
the percutaneous treatment of pain. The Agreement is for a term of five years after the first
acceptance of the unique RF generator by Stryker, which was on November 11, 2004.

There is a minimum purchase obligation that is specified by  Agreement Year.  The first
Agreement Year commenced on November 11, 2004 and ended on the last day of the calendar quarter in
which the first anniversary date of such inception date occurs, which was December 31, 2005.
Stryker satisfied the first Agreement Year minimum. In the second and third Agreement Years,
Stryker agreed to make minimum purchases of approximately $500,000 per year for commercial sale
units. On or before the beginning of the last calendar quarter of the third Agreement Year, and
each Agreement Year thereafter, the Company and Stryker will conduct good faith negotiations
regarding the minimum purchase obligation for the next Agreement Year. Also, during the first two
months of the last calendar quarter in any Agreement Year, the Company and Stryker will conduct
good faith negotiations regarding changes in

8

Table of Contents   

prices that will take effect on the first day of the ensuing Agreement Year. The Agreement
also provides Stryker the right of first refusal for other generator products in pain control and
in orthopedic, ENT (ear, nose and throat), craniomaxillofacial and head and neck surgery.

Net sales to Stryker amounted to approximately $833,000 for the period from September 22, 2005
to January 30, 2006. This represented 4.9 percent of net sales for the six months ended January 30,
2006.

Note 5. Stock-Based Compensation 

In addition to the historical options outstanding for Synergetics prior to the merger, the
Company has options outstanding under two existing active option plans and two terminated plans of
Valley Forge. The first active plan (the  2001 Plan ) was adopted by Valley Forge on January 16,
2001 pursuant to which 345,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance to employees,
officers and consultants of the Company. The 2001 Plan was amended with the approval of the Valley
Forge stockholders on September 19, 2005 to increase the number of share awards issuable under the
2001 Plan from 345,000 to 1,345,000. There were 1,144,125 options unawarded at January 30, 2006.
On September 19, 2005, the stockholders of Valley Forge voted to adopt the Valley Forge Scientific
Corp. 2005 Non-Employee Directors  Stock Option Plan and voted to authorize up to 200,000 shares
issuable upon exercise of options granted thereunder. There were 140,000 options available for
future grants at January 30, 2006. Generally, options were granted with an exercise price equal to
fair market value at the date of grant and expire 10 years from the date of the grant. Generally,
stock options granted vest over a five year period with the exception of the Non-Employee Director
options which vest immediately. All options under the Valley Forge stock option plans were valued
at approximately $815,000 in the purchase price accounting allocation.

The following table shows activity under the Company s plans for the six months ended January
30, 2006:

The following table provides information about unvested options for the six months ended

The weighted average remaining life for options outstanding and weighted average exercise price per
share for exercisable options at January 30, 2006 were as follows:

There were no stock options granted during the three months ended January 30, 2006. The fair
value of options granted during the six months ended January 30, 2006 was determined at the date of
the grant using a Black-Scholes options-pricing model and the following assumptions:

Expected average risk-free interest rate

4.0 
     % 

Expected average life (in years)

5 

Expected volatility

79.7 
     % 

Expected dividend yield

0 
     % 

The expected average risk-free rate is based on U.S. treasury yield curve. The expected average
life represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving
consideration to vesting schedules, historical exercise and forfeiture patterns. Expected
volatility is based on historical volatilities of Valley Forge s common stock. The expected
dividend yield is based on historical information and management s plan.

Pledged assets; short and long-term debt (excluding revenue bonds payable) 

Short-term debt as of January 30, 2006 and July 31, 2005 consisted of the following:

Revolving Credit Facilities:  Under a revolving credit facility, the Company may borrow up to
$1.25 million with interest at the bank s prime lending rate less 0.25 percent. Borrowings under
this facility at January 30, 2006 and July 31, 2005 were $623,000 and $235,000, respectively.
Outstanding amounts are collateralized by Synergetics  receivables and inventory. This credit
facility, initially scheduled to expire on February 15, 2006, was extended until March 15, 2006 and
was replaced on March 13, 2006 by a new facility.

On March 13, 2006, the Company entered into a new credit facility under which the Company may
borrow up to $5.5 million with a graduated interest rate starting at LIBOR plus 2.25 percent and
adjusting each quarter based upon the Company s leverage ratio. Outstanding amounts are
collateralized by Synergetics  receivables and inventory. This credit facility expires on December
1, 2007. The facility has two financial covenants: a maximum leverage ratio of 3.75 times and a
minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.1 times.

In conjunction with the reverse merger described in Note 3, the Company assumed a line of
credit with available borrowings of up to $1.0 million with interest at the bank s prime lending
rate. There were no borrowings under the facility as of January 30, 2006. The facility is unsecured
and requires the Company to maintain a tangible net worth of no less than $3.4 million. This credit
facility expires on March 31, 2006.

Equipment Line of Credit:  Under this credit facility, Synergetics may borrow up to $1.0
million, with interest at the bank s prime lending rate. Outstanding amounts are secured by the
purchased equipment. In October 2005, the Company signed a loan agreement consolidating the then
outstanding balance on the equipment line, along with three specific notes, under one new bank note
in the principal amount of $1,427,105. The Company will make principal payments of $39,642 plus
interest, on a monthly basis. The effective interest rate for this note is 6.75 percent. Final
payment is due on September 30, 2008. The equipment line of credit facility of $1.0 million was
also renewed as of this date and expires on September 30, 2006. Borrowings under this facility at
January 30, 2006 were $588,132.

Long-term debt as of January 30, 2006 and July 31, 2005 consisted of the following:

Table of Contents   

Note 7. Related Party Transactions 

Notes receivable, officer-stockholder represents various loans made during and before 2001 to
a principal stockholder, director and officer of the Company. The notes bear interest at rates of
4.83 percent to 6.97 percent and are payable in either quarterly installments of $3,525 or annual
installments of $14,100 until the principal and accrued interest have been repaid. The notes are
partially collateralized by 5,833 shares of the Company s common stock. At January 30, 2006, notes
receivable, officer-stockholder totaled $25,707. As of January 30, 2006, all notes are current.

Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies 

The estimated remaining commitment applicable to construction in progress on the O Fallon,
Missouri facility, to be incurred subsequent to January 30, 2006, was approximately $140,000. This
amount represents the release of the final retainage.

In conjunction with the reverse merger described in Note 3, the Company became a lessee of a
combination sublease and lease that commenced on May 1, 2005 for a term of four and one-half years,
for office, assembly and manufacturing space in Upper Merion Township, Pennsylvania, with an
initial annual rental of $75,858, increasing to $129,437, plus annual operating expenses.

Also in conjunction with the reverse merger described in Note 3, the Company entered into
three-year employment agreements with its Chief Executive Officer, its Chief Operating Officer and
its Chief Scientific Officer. In the event any such executive officer is terminated without cause,
or if such executive officer resigns for good reason, such executive officer shall be entitled to
his base salary and health care benefits through the end of his employment agreement.

On October 19, 2005, IRIDEX Corporation filed suit in the United States District Court,
Eastern District of Missouri against the Company for patent infringement of the IRIDEX Patent No.
5,085,492 entitled  Optical Fiber with Electrical Encoding . IRIDEX alleges that Synergetics  Quick
Disconnect Laser Probes and adapter infringe its patent. It seeks damages, including treble
damages, and injunctive relief. On November 30, 2005, the Company filed its answer in this lawsuit
and asked the court to declare that its products do not infringe the IRIDEX patent. In addition,
the Company countersued IRIDEX alleging that it engaged in false advertising, commercial
disparagement, trade libel, injurious falsehood and unfair competition under the Federal Lanham Act
and applicable Missouri common law. The counterclaim also includes a count of defamation. The
claims primarily relate to alleged false or misleading statements and publications by IRIDEX and
its representatives with respect to the Company s laser adapters and laser probes. Management is
not able at this time to predict the ultimate effect of this litigation, if any, on the Company s
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

On January 10, 2006, Synergetics filed a suit in United States District Court, Eastern
District of Pennsylvania against Innovatech and Peregrine for infringement of U.S. Patent No.
6,984,230. This suit is captioned Synergetics, Inc. v. Peregrine Surgical, Ltd. and Innovatech
Surgical, Inc., Case No. 2:06-CV-00107. The suit against Innovatech and Peregrine arises out of
defendant s sale, use and manufacture of a laser probe that is alleged to infringe Synergetics 
patent. Synergetics seeks damages and injunctive relief in this action. The defendants have
asserted by way of affirmative defenses or counterclaims,  inter alia , that they do not infringe the
patent, that the patent in the suit is invalid and that Synergetics engaged in inequitable conduct
rendering the patent unenforceable. Innovatech also counterclaimed for alleged violations of the
Federal Lanham Act. Synergetics does not believe the patent is invalid or that it engaged in
inequitable conduct or conduct that violated the Federal Lanham Act, and intends to vigorously
prosecute this litigation and defend the counterclaim. Management is not able at this time to
predict the ultimate effect of this litigation, if any, on the Company s financial position,
results of operations, or cash flows.

Various other claims, incidental to the ordinary course of business, are pending against the
Company. In the opinion of management, after consulting with legal counsel, resolution of these
matters is not expected to have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.

The Company is subject to regulatory requirements throughout the world. In the normal course
of business, these regulatory agencies may require companies in the medical industry to change
their products or operating procedures, which could affect the Company. The Company regularly
incurs expenses to comply with these regulations and may be required to incur additional expenses.
Management is not able to estimate any additional expenditure outside the normal course of
operations which will be incurred by the Company in future periods in order to comply with these
regulations.

Overview 

Synergetics USA, Inc. ( Synergetics USA  or  Company ) is a Delaware corporation incorporated
on June 2, 2005 in connection with the reverse merger of Synergetics, Inc. ( Synergetics ) and
Valley Forge Scientific Corp. ( Valley Forge ) on September 21, 2005 and the subsequent
reincorporation of Valley Forge (the predecessor to Synergetics USA) in Delaware on September 22,
2005. A majority of the Company s operations are conducted by Synergetics, a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company. The reverse merger was accounted for as a purchase business combination
with Synergetics deemed the accounting acquirer and Valley Forge s assets acquired and liabilities
assumed recorded at fair value.

The Company designs, manufactures and markets precision engineered microsurgical instruments,
capital equipment and devices primarily for use in vitreoretinal surgery and neurosurgical
applications. Its products are designed and manufactured to support micro or minimally invasive
surgical procedures. In addition, the Company designs and manufactures disposable and
non-disposable supplies and accessories for use with such products.

The Company is currently the exclusive distributor of the Sonopet Omni     
( Omni      ) ultrasonic aspirator used for tumor removal, bone removal and resection. Until
December 1, 2005, our exclusive distribution territory consisted of the United States and Canada.

15

Table of Contents   

Beginning December 1, 2005, we have exclusive distribution rights, which include Australia and
New Zealand, most of Europe with the exception of Spain and Portugal, Latin America and the
northern part of South America. During the second quarter of 2006, the manufacturer of the Omni s
regulatory auditors recommended that its CE mark be extended to the OMNI     . Therefore,
the Company has the ability to market the OMNI and accessories in the European Union and other
countries that accept the CE certification. In addition to our efforts to expand the installed
base of Omni      units, we are working to expand our disposables and follow-on product
offerings. Working jointly with leading neurosurgeons, we have developed, are in the process of
obtaining patents for and are manufacturing proprietary disposable ultrasonic tips and tubing sets
for use with the Omni      ultrasonic aspirator. We expect these new offerings will expand
and enhance the Omni      product category.

We anticipate that the combination of Synergetics and Valley Forge should strategically
position us for future growth of our neurosurgical product line, and we expect that the relative
revenue contribution of our neurosurgical products will rise in 2006 as a result of the
combination. On October 12, 2005, we exercised our option with respect to the Malis     
trademark, a trademark that is widely recognized and respected in the neurosurgery field. On
October 17, 2005, we announced our Malis      Advantage TM , a fourth generation,
multifunctional bipolar electrosurgical generator, along with new proprietary single-use,
hand-switching instruments, at the 2005 Annual Meeting of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons in
Boston, Massachusetts. The new generator will represent a significant advancement in technology and
performance and may replace other surgical tools in certain applications, such as monopolar
electrosurgical systems and lasers. The
Malis     
Advantage TM 
is expected to be released for
market testing shortly. During the second quarter of 2006, the Company s regulatory
auditors have recommended that Synergetics, Inc. s CE mark be extended to the electrosurgical
generators manufactured by Synergetics USA, Inc. Therefore, the Company has the ability to market
its electrosurgical generators and accessories in the European Union and other countries that
accept the CE certification.

The Company s business strategy has been, and is expected to continue to be, the development
and marketing of new technologies for the ophthalmic surgery and neurosurgery markets. New
products, which management defines as products introduced within the prior 24-month period,
accounted for approximately 23.6 percent of total sales for the Company for the six months ended
January 30, 2006, approximately $4.0 million. In addition, approximately $3.0 million of total net
sales for the Company for the six months ended January 30, 2006 was from the net sales of bipolar
electrosurgical generators, pain control generators, Bident TM  generators, and
disposables sales from the former Valley Forge. For the six months ended January 31, 2005, new
products accounted for approximately 18.4 percent of total net sales for Synergetics, or
approximately $1.9 million. This growth in the percentage of sales associated with new products was
primarily in our capital equipment products both in the ophthalmic and neurosurgery markets.
Synergetics  past revenue growth has been closely aligned with the adoption by surgeons of new
technologies introduced by Synergetics. Since August 1, 2005, Synergetics has introduced eleven new
products to the ophthalmic and neurosurgery markets. We expect adoption rates for the Company s new
products in the future to have a similar effect on its operating performance.

In addition to the approximately $3.0 million of total net sales from the former Valley Forge,
volume and mix improvements contributed to the sales growth for the Company during the six months
ended January 30, 2006 and January 31, 2005. Ophthalmic procedures volume, particularly retina
procedures, on a global basis continues to rise at an estimated 5 percent growth rate driven by an
aging global population, new technologies, advances in surgical techniques and a growing global
market resulting from ongoing improvements in healthcare delivery in third world countries, among
other factors. In addition, the demand for high quality products and new technologies, such as the
Company s innovative instruments and disposables, to support growth in surgical procedure volume
continues to positively impact growth. The Company believes innovative surgical approaches will
continue to significantly impact the ophthalmic and neurosurgery market.

During the fiscal quarter ended January 30, 2006, we had net sales of $9.9 million, which
generated $6.1 million in gross profit, operating income of $1.5 million and net income of
$858,053, or $0.04 earnings per share. During the six months ended January 30, 2006, we had net
sales of $17.0 million, which generated $11.0 million in gross profit, operating income of $2.2
million and net income of $1.3 million, or $0.08 earnings per share. The financial results of
Valley Forge and the shares issued in the reverse merger have only been included from the day
following the date of the consummation of the merger through the end of the six months ended
January 30, 2006. The Company had $549,584 in cash and cash equivalents and $10.4 million in
interest-bearing debt and revenue bonds as of January 30, 2006. For the six months ended January
30, 2006, we used $1.0 million in cash to fund operations and $838,290 in investing activities,
partially offset by $609,300 provided by financing activities. We anticipate that cash flows from
operations, together with available borrowings under our existing credit facilities will be
sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service needs. If investment
opportunities arise, the Company believes that its earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will
allow it to obtain additional capital, if necessary.

Our Business Strategy 

Our goal is to become a global leader in the development, manufacture and marketing of
precision engineered microsurgical instruments, capital equipment and devices for use in
vitreoretinal surgery and neurosurgical applications and to grow our product lines in other
specialty surgical markets. Our recent combination of the businesses of Valley Forge and
Synergetics is a significant component of our strategy toward achieving these goals. Our strategy
includes:

Introducing new technology that can be easily differentiated from our competition by
capitalizing on our combined successes in delivering minimally invasive products that enable
concentrated application to a surgical area with decreased impact beyond the specific desired
surgical effects, resulting in improved recovery times and shorter hospital stays; 

Identifying microsurgical niches that may offer the prospect for substantial growth and
higher profit margins that allow us an opportunity to build upon our existing technologies,
such as expanding the use of our products in ENT (ear, nose and throat), plastic surgery and
other forms of microsurgery; 

Accelerating our international (including Canada) growth by continuing to build on our recent
successes supported by Valley Forge s long-established relationships and reputation in global
markets; 

Combining the breadth and depth of knowledge, experience and resources in Valley Forge s and
Synergetics  existing research and development groups to form a new combined research and
development capability aligned to deliver precision engineered instruments based on our own
proprietary technologies and innovations; 

Branding and marketing a substantial portion of our neurosurgical products with the
Malis      trademark; 

Developing hybrid direct sales/independent sales agent distribution channels to assure that
our products and benefits are seen by those making or influencing the purchasing decisions; 

Marketing our new state-of-the-art multifunctional bipolar electrosurgical system, known as
the Malis      Advantage TM , with our new proprietary single use
hand-switching bipolar instruments including enhanced features and functionality to expand the
array of procedures they are designed to perform; 

Growing our disposables revenue stream by focusing on the development of a full offering of
disposable adjuncts, such as instruments, adapters and fiber optics, to our capital equipment
offerings and emphasizing disposables designed to eliminate hospital repair costs and minimize
patient-to-patient disease transfer; 

Expanding the use of our new multifunctional bipolar electrosurgical generator, which will be
marketed as the Malis      Advantage TM , into other surgical markets as its
increased power and functionality allows the surgeon to perform functions similar to
traditional monopolar systems, without the inherent safety limitations; and 

Exploring opportunities for growth through strategic partnering with other companies with
complimentary products and technologies to facilitate strategic growth in our defined niche
markets, such as our current relationship with Stryker Corporation.

Results of Operations 

The business combination of Synergetics and Valley Forge was accounted for as a reverse
merger, and as such, the Company is reporting the financial results of Synergetics as the
accounting acquiror in the merger, together with the financial results of Valley Forge for the
period September 22, 2005 through January 30, 2006. As a result, management s discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the periods set forth below reflects
the effect of the combination of Synergetics and Valley Forge, which was consummated on September
21, 2005. Also, in conjunction with the merger, we started to operate in two distinct business
segments based on the types of products sold. The Synergetics segment includes our ophthalmic and
neurosurgical instruments, other than bipolar electrosurgical generators, and Omni     
ultrasonic aspirators. The Valley Forge segment is comprised of our bipolar electrosurgical
generators.

Three Month Period Ended January 30, 2006 Compared to Three Month Period Ended January 31, 2005 

Net Sales 

The following table presents net sales by segment (dollars in thousands):

Ophthalmic sales growth was led by continued growth in sales of Synergetics  core technology
areas of instruments and illumination. When comparing neurosurgery net sales of Synergetics during
the second fiscal quarter of 2006 to the second fiscal quarter of 2005, 2006 sales are 96.3 percent
greater than 2005 sales, primarily attributable to the sales in the core technology area of power
ultrasonic aspirators and related disposables. Included in the sales
of $2,204,000 from Valley Forge is $311,000 of royalty income from
Codman. The mix of capital equipment to disposable product sales for
the combined Company is approximately 45% and 55%, respectively. We expect that sales of products in these core
technologies will have a positive impact on net sales for the remainder of fiscal 2006. In
addition, we anticipate that the positive effects of the Malis      Advantage TM 
will begin to be reflected in operations in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006.

The following table presents national and international net sales (dollars in thousands):

Table of Contents   

Gross Profit 

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 62.2 percent in the second quarter of fiscal
2006 compared to 63.0 percent for the same period in fiscal 2005. Gross profit as a percentage of
net sales from the second quarter of fiscal 2005 to the second quarter of fiscal 2006 decreased
approximately one percentage point, primarily as a of result of a change in mix of sales toward OEM
capital equipment sales which generate lower margins, offset by royalty payments received from
Codman during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 which were not required during the second quarter
of fiscal 2005.

Operating Expenses 

Research and development ( R D ) as a percentage of net sales was 4.2 percent and 3.5 percent
for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. R D costs increased to $416,886 in
the second quarter of fiscal 2006 from $185,578 in the same period in fiscal 2005, reflecting not
only an increase in spending on active projects focused on areas of strategic significance, but
also approximately $190,000 in R D for the former Valley Forge. Synergetics  pipeline included
approximately 40 active, major projects in various stages of completion as of January 30, 2006. The
Company has strategically targeted R D spending as a percentage of net sales to be consistent with
what management believes to be an average range for the industry. The Company expects over the next
few years to invest in R D at a rate ranging from approximately 4.0 percent to 6.0 percent of net
sales.

Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A ) increased by $1,786,277 to $4,260,883
during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared to $2,474,606 during the second quarter of
fiscal 2005. However, the percentage of SG A to net sales decreased from 46.2 percent for the
second quarter of fiscal 2005 to 43.2 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 as sales rose
more quickly than SG A expenditures. Selling expenses, which consist of salaries and commissions,
the largest component of SG A, increased approximately $550,000 to $1.9 million, or 19.3 percent of
net sales, for the second quarter of fiscal 2006, compared to $1.4 million, or 26.2 percent of net
sales, for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. In addition, direct selling expenses and advisory
director fees increased $310,000. The increase was also impacted by approximately $717,000 of SG A
for the former Valley Forge. General and administrative headcount increased approximately 22.7
percent, which resulted in an increase in other costs of approximately $210,000 in the second
quarter of fiscal 2006, as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The Company expects to
realize synergies from the Valley Forge/Synergetics merger over the next 18 months, which may be
partially offset by ongoing expenses related to the integration of the two companies.

Other Expense 

Other expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 increased 970.0 percent to $156,277 from
$14,605 for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The increase was due primarily to increased interest
expense on the note payable to the estate of Dr. Malis and increased borrowings of the working
capital line due to working capital needs during the quarter.

Operating Income, Income Taxes and Net Income 

Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 increased 106.1 percent to $1.5 million
from $706,771 in the comparable 2005 fiscal period. The increase in operating income was primarily
the result of approximately $559,000 in operating income contributed from the Valley Forge merger.

Synergetics  effective tax rate was 34.0 percent for the second fiscal quarter of 2006 as
compared to 38.8 percent for the second fiscal quarter of 2005. The decrease was due primarily to
research and experimentation credit expectations for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2006.

Net income increased by $434,456 to $858,053; or 97.5% from $423,597 for the second quarter of
fiscal 2006, as compared to the same 2005 period. The growth in net income was primarily the result
of approximately $330,000 in net income contributed from the Valley Forge merger. Basic and diluted
earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 decreased to $0.04 from $0.12 for the
second quarter of fiscal 2005. The decrease in earnings per share was the result of issuing
15,960,648 shares in the merger of Synergetics and Valley Forge. These shares were counted as
outstanding for the full 63 business days during second fiscal quarter of 2006. Basic
weighted-average shares outstanding increased from 3,411,364 to 23,934,251.

Six Month Period Ended January 30, 2006 Compared to Six Month Period Ended January 31, 2005 

Net Sales 

The following table presents net sales by segment (dollars in thousands):

Ophthalmic sales growth was led by continued growth in sales of Synergetics  core technology
areas of instruments and illumination. When comparing neurosurgery net sales of Synergetics during
the first six months of fiscal 2006 to the first six months of fiscal 2005, 2006 sales are 36.9
percent greater than 2005 sales, primarily attributable to the sales in the core technology area of
power ultrasonic aspirators and related disposables. Included in the
sales of $2,961,000 from Valley Forge is $311,000 of royalty income
from Codman. The mix of capital equipment sales to disposable
products sales for the combined Company is approximately 43% and 57%,
respectively. We expect that sales of products in these core
technologies will have a positive impact on net sales for the remainder of fiscal 2006. In
addition, we anticipate that the positive effects of the Malis      Advantage TM 
will begin to be reflected in operations in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006.

The following table presents national and international net sales (dollars in thousands):

Table of Contents   

Gross Profit 

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 64.5 percent in the first six months of fiscal
2006 compared to 64.4 percent for the same period in fiscal 2005. Gross profit as a percentage of
net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2005 compared to the first six months of fiscal 2006
was relatively flat.

Operating Expenses 

R D as a percentage of net sales was 4.1 percent and 3.5 percent for the first six months of
fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. R D costs increased to $694,147 in the first six months of
fiscal 2006 from $361,187 in the same period in fiscal 2005, reflecting increased spending on
active projects focused on areas of strategic significance. The Company has strategically targeted
R D spending as a percentage of net sales to be consistent with what management believes to be an
average range for the industry. The Company expects over the next few years to invest in R D at a
rate ranging from approximately 4.0 percent to 6.0 percent of net sales.

SG A increased by $3,125,897 during the first six months of fiscal 2006 and as a percentage of
net sales was 47.4 percent for the first six months of fiscal 2006, compared to 47.8 percent for
the first six months of fiscal 2005. Selling expenses, which consist of salaries and commissions,
the largest component of SG A, increased approximately $915,000 to $3.8 million, or 22.4 percent of
net sales, for the first six months of fiscal 2006, compared to $2.8 million, or 27.3 percent of
net sales, for the first six months of fiscal 2005. In addition, general legal fees increased by
$337,000, we recorded compensation expense associated with the adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 123 (Revised 2004),  Share-Based Payment  ( SFAS 123(R) ), of
$99,000 and direct selling expenses and advisory director fees increased by $310,000. The increase
was also impacted by approximately $973,000 of SG A for the former Valley Forge. General and
administrative headcount increased approximately 22.7 percent which resulted in an increase in
other costs of approximately $490,000 in the first six months of fiscal 2006, as compared to the
first six months of fiscal 2005. The Company expects to realize synergies from the Valley
Forge/Synergetics merger over the next 18 months, which may be partially offset by ongoing expenses
related to the integration of the two companies.

Other Expense 

Other expense for the first six months of fiscal 2006 increased 71.9 percent to $180,212 from
$104,834 for the first six months of fiscal 2005. The increase was due primarily to increased
interest expense on the note payable to the estate of Dr. Malis and increased borrowings of the
working capital line due to working capital needs during the quarter.

Operating Income, Income Taxes and Net Income 

Operating income for the first six months of fiscal 2006 increased 64.4 percent to $2.2
million from $1.3 million in the comparable 2005 fiscal period. The increase in operating income
was primarily the result of approximately $663,000 in operating income contributed from the Valley
Forge merger.

Synergetics  effective tax rate was 34.0 percent for the first six months of fiscal 2006 as
compared to 36.1 percent for the first six months of fiscal 2005. The decrease was due primarily to
research and experimentation credit expectations for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2006.

Net income increased to $1.3 million from $794,820 for the first six months of fiscal 2006, as
compared to the same 2005 period. The growth in net income was primarily the result of
approximately $555,000 in net income contributed from the Valley Forge merger. In addition, other
expense increased approximately $75,000 and income tax expense increased $245,000 despite the
decrease in the effective tax rate due to the increase in income before income tax provision. Basic
and diluted earnings per share for the first six months of fiscal 2006 decreased to $0.08 from
$0.23 for the first six months of fiscal 2005. The decrease in earnings per share was the result of
issuing 15,960,648 shares in the merger of Synergetics and Valley Forge. These shares were counted
as outstanding for 99 business days during the first six months of fiscal 2006. Therefore, basic
weighted-average shares outstanding increased from 3,412,614 to 17,196,651.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company had $594,584 in cash and cash equivalents and total interest-bearing debt and
revenue bonds payable of $10,379,464 as of January 30, 2006.

Working capital, including the management of inventory and accounts receivable, is a key
management focus. At January 30, 2006, the Company had 54 days of sales outstanding for the three
month period ending January 30, 2006 (annualized) in accounts receivable, favorable to July 31,
2005 by two days. The Company utilized the three month period as it included a full reporting
period of sales from the merged companies.

At January 30, 2006, the Company had 95 days sales in inventory on hand, favorable to July 31,
2005 by 25 days. The 95 days sales in inventory on hand at January 30, 2006 is at the low end of
the Company s anticipated levels of 100 to 110 days sales in inventory. In terms of inventory
stated on a cost basis, we have 252 days of inventory on hand at January 30, 2006 as compared to
317 days at July 31, 2005. This decrease is due to the mix of inventory on hand being less capital
equipment intensive at the end of the quarter. The Company utilized the three month period as it
included a full reporting period of sales from the merged companies. Management believes that
meeting the customer expectations regarding delivery times is important to its growth strategy.

Cash flows used in operating activities were $1,038,249 for the six months ended January 30,
2006, compared to cash flows used in operating activities of $369,001 for the comparable fiscal
2005 period. The increase in cash used of $669,248 was attributable to net usage increase
applicable to accounts receivable of $1,571,461 and inventories of $417,247. Accounts receivable
changes were due to the increased sales volume especially in January, the last month of the
quarter. Inventories build-up was to support such sales growth. Such increases were partially
offset by cash provided by greater net income of approximately $549,222, an increase in accounts
payable of $458,897 and other net working capital and other adjustments components of approximately
$311,341.

Cash flows used by investing activities were $838,290 for the six months of fiscal 2006,
compared to cash used of $505,448 for the comparable fiscal 2005 period. During the six months
ended January 30, 2006, the Company paid $61,060 in cash for the acquisition of patents, compared
to $62,303 for the comparable 2005 period. Cash additions to property and equipment during the six
months ended January 30, 2006 were $2,281,779 compared to $443,145 for the six months of fiscal
2005. Increases in fiscal 2006 were primarily to support the facility expansion at the Company s
manufacturing facility in O Fallon, Missouri. Cash acquired through the reverse merger with Valley
Forge was approximately $2.0 million. In addition, the Company paid acquisition costs in connection
with such reverse merger of $515,446 in the six months ended January 30, 2006 that were not
applicable to the six months ended January 31, 2005. Other net uses of cash in investing
activities was $3,950.

Cash flows provided by financing activities were $609,300 for the six months ended January 30,
2006, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $151,196 for the six months ended
January 31, 2005. The increase of $458,104 was applicable primarily to increased in borrowings on
the lines-of-credit of $387,640 and net proceeds of long-term debt of $513,254 offset by the down
payment and quarterly principal payments of $270,111 on the note payable to the estate of the late
Dr. Leonard I. Malis for the acquisition of the Malis      trademark and regularly scheduled
payments of $124,375 on the revenue bonds payable. The increase was supplemented by the proceeds
from stock option exercises of $102,892.

The Company had the following committed financing arrangements as of January 30, 2006:

Revolving Credit Facilities:  Under the Company s prior revolving credit facility, the Company
could borrow up to $1.25 million at an interest rate of the lender s prime lending rate less 0.25
percent. Borrowings under this facility at January 30, 2006 were $623,000. Outstanding amounts were
secured by the Company s receivables and inventory. This credit facility, initially scheduled to
expire on February 15, 2006, was extended until March 15, 2006 and replaced on March 13, 2006 by a
new facility.

On March 13, 2006, the Company entered into a new credit facility under which the Company may
borrow up to $5.5 million with a graduated interest rate starting at LIBOR plus 2.25 percent and
adjusting each quarter based upon our leverage ratio. Outstanding amounts are collateralized by
Synergetics  receivables and inventory. This credit facility expires on December 1, 2007. The
facility has two financial covenants: a maximum leverage ratio of 3.75 times and a minimum fixed
charge coverage ratio of 1.1 times.

22

Table of Contents   

In addition, we have a line of credit of $1.0 million at an interest rate of the lender s
prime lending rate. There were no borrowings under this facility at January 30, 2006. Outstanding
amounts are unsecured. The facility requires us to have a tangible net worth of no less than
$3,400,000, which we exceeded at January 30, 2006. This credit facility will expire on March 31,
2006.

Equipment Line of Credit:  Under this credit facility, Synergetics may borrow up to $1.0
million, at an interest rate of the lender s prime lending rate. Outstanding amounts are secured
by the equipment purchased under this line. In October 2005, the Company signed a loan agreement
consolidating the then outstanding balance on the equipment line, along with three specific notes,
under one new bank note in the principal amount of $1,427,105. The Company will make principal
payments of $39,642 plus interest, on a monthly basis. The effective interest rate for this note is
6.75 percent. Final payment is due on September 30, 2008. The equipment line of credit facility of
$1.0 million was also renewed as of this date and expires on September 30, 2006. Borrowings under
this facility at January 30, 2006 were $588,132.

Management believes that cash flows from operations, together with available borrowing under
its existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the Company s working capital, capital
expenditure and debt service needs. If investment opportunities arise, the Company believes that
its earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will allow it to obtain additional capital, if
necessary.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The Company s critical accounting policies which require management s judgment are disclosed
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2005. In the first six months of
fiscal 2006, the following significant accounting policies were changed as a result of the reverse
merger with Valley Forge:

Principles of consolidation:  Through the date of the reverse merger described in Note 3, the
condensed consolidated financial statements included the accounts of Synergetics and its wholly
owned subsidiaries: Synergetics Development Company, LLC and an 83 percent owned subsidiary,
Synergetics Laser, LLC. Thereafter, the condensed consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Synergetics USA, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries: Synergetics, Synergetics IP,
Inc. and Synergetics Development Company, LLC. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.

Property and equipment:  Leasehold improvements are being amortized over the related lease term
or estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter.

Goodwill and other intangibles:  Absent any impairment indicators, goodwill is tested for
impairment on an annual basis. The Company expects to perform its impairment tests during the
fourth fiscal quarter. Intangible assets, consisting of patents, licensing agreements and
proprietary know-how are amortized to operations under the straight-line method over their
estimated useful lives or statutory lives whichever is shorter. These periods range from two to ten
years. The life of a trademark is inextricably related to the life of the product bearing the mark
or the life of the business entity owning the trademark. The Company intends to use the trademark
indefinitely, and therefore its useful life is not limited to any specific product. The trademark
constitutes an indefinite-lived intangible that will be used in perpetuity.

Revenue recognition:  The Company records revenue from product sales when the revenue is
realized and the product is shipped from its facilities. This includes satisfying the following
criteria: the arrangement with the customer is evident, usually through the receipt of a purchase
order; the sales price is fixed and determinable; delivery has occurred; and collectibility is
reasonably ensured. Freight and shipping billed to customers is included in net sales, and the cost
of shipping is included in cost of sales.

Service revenue substantially relates to repairs of products and is recognized when the
service has been completed. Revenue from license and royalty fees is recorded when earned.

Stock-based compensation:  As of August 1, 2005, SFAS No. 123(R) became effective for the
Company. The Company had previously followed Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25  Accounting
for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation  ( APB No. 25 ) and related interpretations
in accounting for its employee and stock options. Under APB No. 25, no compensation expense was
recognized, if the exercise price of the Company s employee stock options equaled or exceeded the
market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant. Under SFAS 123(R), compensation
expense is now recognized. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on
the fair value of the award and is recognized over the directors  and employees  requisite service
period. Compensation expense is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
Company has elected to use the modified prospective transition method. Under the modified
prospective transition method, an entity uses the fair value based accounting method for all
employee awards granted, modified or settled after the effective date. As of the effective date,
compensation costs related to the nonvested portion of awards outstanding as of that date are based
on the grant-date fair value of those awards as calculated under the original provisions of SFAS
123  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  that is, an entity would not remeasure the
grant-date fair value estimate of the unvested portion of awards granted prior to the effective
date of SFAS 123(R).

Segment information:  The Synergetics segment includes revenue and operating expenses
associated with the sales of ophthalmic and neurosurgical instruments and Omni     
ultrasonic aspirator. The Valley Forge segment includes revenue and operating expenses associated
with the sales of bipolar electrosurgical generators. The financial results of Valley Forge have
been included from September 22, 2005 through January 30, 2006.

Item 3   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

The Company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rate
variability.

At January 30, 2006, the Company had two revolving credit facilities and an equipment line of
credit facility in place. The Company s $1.25 million revolving credit facility had an outstanding
balance of $623,000 at January 30, 2006 and its equipment line of credit facility had an
outstanding balance of $588,132 at January 30, 2006. The Company s $1.0 million line of credit had
no outstanding balance at January 30, 2006. The equipment line of credit facility and the $1.0
million line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime lending rate. The $1.25 million revolving
credit facility bears interest at the lender s prime lending rate less 0.25%. Interest expense
from these credit facilities is subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest
rates. Assuming the current levels of borrowings at variable rates and a two-percentage-point
increase in the average interest rate on these borrowings, it is estimated that our interest
expense would have increased by approximately $24,000. On March 13, 2006, the Company entered into
a new credit facility replacing its $1.25 million revolving credit facility. Under its new credit
facility, the Company may borrow up to $5.5 million with a graduated interest rate starting at
LIBOR plus 2.25 percent and adjusting each quarter based upon the Company s leverage ratio. The
Company does not perform any interest rate hedging activities related to its credit facilities.

Additionally, the Company has exposure to foreign currency fluctuation through export sales to
international accounts. As only approximately 5 percent of our sales revenue is denominated in
foreign currencies, we estimate that a change in the relative strength of the U.S. dollar to
foreign currencies would not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations. The
Company does not conduct any hedging activities related to foreign currency.

Item 4   Controls and Procedures 

We have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of January 30, 2006. Based on this evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective as of January 30, 2006, the period covered by this report,
because of a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting described
more fully below.

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A material
weakness is a deficiency in an internal control that results in more than a remote likelihood that
a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
detected. All internal controls systems, no matter how well-designed, have inherent limitations.
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

In the course of the annual audit of Synergetics  fiscal year ended July 31, 2005, management
concluded that there was a deficiency in its internal control relating to inventory. This control
deficiency, which management determined to be a material weakness, relates to Synergetics 
accounting system not being properly updated for raw materials purchased throughout the period,
resulting in incorrect average prices and an incorrect value of inventory recorded in its
accounting records. Because the accounting system is not being updated properly, the perpetual
inventory required substantial adjustment at year-end. The Company has hired a qualified production
planning manager and is in the process of evaluating manual procedures to promptly and routinely
update price changes applicable to raw materials (and other inventories) purchased. In addition,
the Company is in the process of updating its Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System which will
allow the changes in raw materials prices to be appropriately tracked through the accounting
system. Such new procedures and updated ERP system will result in more accurate and reliable
interim and year-end financial information with respect to inventories and cost of goods sold and
should enable the Company to avoid unexpected significant adjustments related to this process at
period-end.

The Company made changes in its internal control over financial reporting to incorporate
Valley Forge s financial reporting into Synergetics Inc. s financial reporting including a change
in the accounting and finance reporting structure during the first six months of the fiscal year
covered by this report. No other changes were made that would materially affect the internal
control over financial reporting.

Part II   Other Information 

Item 1   Legal Proceedings 

On February 11, 2004, Synergetics, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary, filed an action
against two ex-employees, which alleged that the defendants, among other things, misappropriated
trade secrets, intentionally interfered with Synergetics  business relationships and breached
confidentiality agreements. Subsequently, Synergetics filed an amended complaint adding claims of
fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. The suit was brought in the United States District Court,
Eastern District of Missouri and was captioned Synergetics, Inc. v. Charles Richard Hurst, Jr. and
Michael McGowan, Case No. 4:04-CV-318DDN. After the court transferred defendants  counterclaim for
tortious interference to New Jersey (where it was subsequently dismissed by defendants), the trial
began on September 12, 2005. On September 20, 2005, the jury found Hurst and McGowan had
intentionally interfered with Synergetics  business relationships and further found that Hurst and
McGowan had misappropriated trade secrets, breached confidentiality agreements and breached
fiduciary duties, including the duty of loyalty. The jury awarded the Company $1,759,165 in
compensatory damages and $586,388 in punitive damages. Defendants moved the Court to dismiss the
case on legal grounds and/or reduce the amount of the jury verdict, and the Company has
additionally requested an injunction against the defendants. On December 9, 2005, the court entered
judgment consistent with the jury s findings, awarded injunctive relief and denied the motion of
defendants to reduce the verdict. On January 9, 2006, defendants filed a notice of appeal.
Proceedings in the appeal are on-going.

On October 21, 2004, Synergetics filed suit in the United States District Court, Eastern
District of Pennsylvania, against Hurst and McGowan s company, Innovatech Surgical, Inc.
( Innovatech ), and its manufacturer, Peregrine Surgical, Ltd. ( Peregrine ) for patent
infringement. This suit is captioned Synergetics, Inc. v. Peregrine Surgical, Ltd. and Innovatech
Surgical, Inc., Case No. 4:04-CV-4939. The suit against Innovatech and Peregrine arises out of the
defendants  sale, use and manufacture of an adapter and connector that are alleged to infringe two
of Synergetics  patents. Synergetics seeks damages and injunctive relief in this action. The
defendants have asserted by way of an affirmative defense that they do not infringe the patents and
that the patents in the suit are invalid. Synergetics does not believe that the patents are invalid
and intends to vigorously prosecute this litigation. Both Synergetics and the defendants have filed
for summary judgment and await the judge s decision.

On October 19, 2005, IRIDEX Corporation filed suit in the United States District Court,
Eastern District of Missouri against the Company for patent infringement. This suit is captioned
IRIDEX Corporation v. Synergetics USA, Inc., Case No. 4:05V1916CDP. IRIDEX Corporation filed suit
against the Company for infringement of the IRIDEX Patent No. 5,085,492 entitled  Optical Fiber
with Electrical Encoding.  IRIDEX alleges that Synergetics  Quick Disconnect Laser Probes and
adapter infringe its patent. It seeks damages, including treble damages and injunctive relief. On
November 30, 2005, the Company filed its answer in this lawsuit and asked the court to declare that
its products do not infringe the IRIDEX patent. In addition, the Company countersued IRIDEX
alleging commercial disparagement, trade libel, injurious falsehood and unfair competition under
the Federal Lanham Act and applicable Missouri law. The counterclaim also includes a count of
defamation. These claims primarily relate to alleged false or misleading statement and
publications by IRIDEX and its representatives with respect to the Company s laser adapters and
laser probes. Litigation in this matter is ongoing.

On January 10, 2006, Synergetics filed a suit in United States District Court, Eastern
District of Pennsylvania against Innovatech and Peregrine for infringement of U.S. Patent No.
6,984,230. This suit is captioned Synergetics, Inc. v. Peregrine Surgical, Ltd. and Innovatech
Surgical, Inc., Case No. 2:06-CV-00107. The suit against Innovatech and Peregrine arises out of
defendant s sale, use and manufacture of a laser probe that is alleged to infringe Synergetics 
patent. Synergetics seeks damages and injunctive relief in this action. The defendants have
asserted by way of affirmative defenses or counterclaims,  inter alia , that they do not infringe the
patent, that the patent in the suit is invalid and that Synergetics engaged in inequitable conduct
rendering the patent unenforceable. Innovatech also counterclaimed for alleged violations of the
Federal Lanham Act. Synergetics does not believe the patent is invalid or that it engaged in
inequitable conduct or conduct that violated the Federal Lanham Act, and intends to vigorously
prosecute this litigation and defend the counterclaim.

On November 29, 2004, Synergetics filed an action in the United States District Court, Eastern
District of Missouri against an ex-employee and his company, Protomedics, LLC ( Protomedics ), for
trade secret misappropriation, intentional interference with business relationships, breach of
contract, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and conversion. This suit was captioned Synergetics, Inc.
v.   Christopher Lumpkin and Protomedics, LLC, Case No 4:04-CV-01650TCM. This suit arose
partly out of such ex-employee s alleged transfer of Synergetics  confidential information to the
principals of Innovatech in breach of existing confidentiality agreements. Synergetics sought
damages and injunctive relief in this action. On December 30, 2004, Christopher Lumpkin and
Protomedics filed counterclaims alleging trade secret misappropriation and breaches of contracts.
In their counterclaims, defendants sought damages, including punitive damages, and injunctive
relief. The Company believes it is not in breach of any contracts and that no

25

misappropriation occurred. A mediation conference was held on September 7, 2005. On November
14, 2005, the parties entered into a non-monetary settlement agreement and on November 15, 2005,
they entered a joint stipulation of dismissal with prejudice.

In addition, from time to time we may become subject to litigation claims that may greatly
exceed our product liability insurance limits. An adverse outcome of such litigation may adversely
impact our financial condition, results of operation and liquidity. We record a liability when a
loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is not
probable, a liability is not recorded. As of January 30, 2006, the Company has no litigation
reserves recorded.

The Company is also involved in certain litigation incidental to the conduct of its business
and affairs. Management does not believe that the outcome of any such litigation will have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operation or liquidity of the
Company.

Item 1A   Risk Factors 

The Company s business is subject to certain risks and events that, if they occur, could
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our
common stock. For a discussion of these risks, please refer to the  Risk Factors  section of the
Company s Annual Report of Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2005. In connection with
its preparation of this quarterly report, management has reviewed and considered these risk factors
and has determined that there have been no material changes to the Company s risk factors since the
date of filing the Annual Report.
