Results of Operations:

Three Months Ended December 31, 1996 compared to December 31, 1995.

For the period from October 1, 1996 through December 31, 1996, the
Registrant had revenues of $1,693,800 of which lease rentals on model
homes totaled $407,936, revenues from the sale of model homes were
$1,018,890 and revenues from option fees were $263,486. Net income for the
period was $163,332 of which a loss of $121,544 was incurred in the
Company's continuing operations and a gain of $284,876 on the disposal
of the divested operation. Depreciation and amortization for the
quarter totaled $149,178 resulting in a positive cash flow from
continuing operations of $27,634.

The Company's revenues from rental income increased approximately
$375,000 (an 1100% increase) during the three months ended December

                                      (9)

31, 1996 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 1995. This
increase is due to additional lease revenues generated from the
purchase of $18,300,000 in model homes in the twelve months ended
December 31, 1996.

Real Estate option fee revenues of $263,486 were generated from the
land acquisition and contract development program, for the quarter
ended December 31, 1996. The Company generated no option fee revenues
for the quarter ended December 31, 1995.

Corporate costs increased from $14,971 for the quarter ended December 31, 1995
to $276,118 for the quarter ended December 31, 1996.  This increase was
attributable to the hiring of five new employees and the selling, general and
administrative costs associated with generating the increased revenue levels.
Corporate expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased 29% from 45%
for the quarter ended December 31, 1995 to 16% for the quarter ended
December 31, 1996.

Six Months Ended December 31, 1996 compared to December 31, 1995.

Due to the limited operating history of the Company, (date of inception
November 2, 1995) six month comparative figures are not presented.

Model homes on lease net of accumulated depreciation have increased to
$17,912,459 at December 31, 1996 from $1,930,788 at December 31, 1995, 
a 827% increase.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Registrant's principal business, leasing of model homes and land
acquisition and contract development, is a capital-intensive operation
requiring constant infusions of cash as the number and size of transactions in
which the Registrant is involved increases.  To date, this business has been
financed by capital contributed and loans made by shareholders,
secured loans from banks, and an offshore private placement.

These capital contributions, loans and offering have been adequate to permit
the Registrant to carry on operations to date.  However, in order to finance
the expansion of operations over the coming fiscal year, additional funds
must be raised through the issuance of debt or equity securities.  To fill
this need, the Registrant anticipates completing a securities offering of
$5-15 million prior to the end of fiscal 1997. The net proceeds of this
offering, together with existing cash of approximately $186,000 will enable
the Company to finance its growing level of operations.  In addition, the
Registrant has $3,600,000 available on a revolving line of credit from
Capital Bank of Miami, Florida.

                                      (11)

The Company is currently negotiating the following to finance current as
well as future expansion:

  * $10,000,000 credit facility with a Denver, Colorado bank.

  * $25,000,000 syndicated credit facility.

  * $30,000,000 private placement of Senior Notes with warrants.

  * $125,000,000-$150,000,000 structured finance as well as a securitization
    program.

  * Convertible debt and/or convertible preferred stock private placements 
    with institutional investors.

The Company continually explores a multitude of debt and equity options.

The Registrant's present commitments for capital expenditures include the
purchase of $3,300,000 in model homes from Engle Homes, and $3,100,000 in
model homes from The Fortress Group, with closings scheduled from January 1997
through March 1997.  Verbal commitments have been made to purchase $9,000,000
in model homes from Laing Homes, and $3,100,000 from Continental Homes, with
closings anticipated between February 1997 and April 1997.

The Registrant expects that it will be able to finance these transactions and
others it currently is negotiating through available cash from the sources
described above and from other secured bank loans.  In addition, the
Registrant is exploring the possibility of selling, either publicly or
privately, securities backed by its model home inventory and land contract
and development contracts.  There can be no assurance, however, that any of
the anticipated sources of funding will ultimately be available to the
Registrant or that other financing will be available on acceptable terms.

Trends in Operations

The Registrant's operations are currently accelerating at a rapid rate. Such
growth has resulted from the ongoing acquisition of model homes under lease
and from the implementation of the Company's new land acquisition and
contract development program.  Both programs have generated significant
interest from  national real estate developers including Hovnanian, Engle,
Bovis, Pulte, MDC, Avatar, Ryland,  and others.  The Company's successful
implementation of these programs has led to increased credit facilities. 
JJFN is currently negotiating new credit relationships with major financial
institutions (banks, insurance companies, public and private investors, and
financial subsidiaries of major industrial corporations).

For the quarter ended December 31, 1996, purchases of model homes exceeded
$5,700,000, increasing total model homes on lease at December 31, 1996 to
over  $18,000,000.  Monthly lease rental revenues increase to  over
$180,000, starting in January 1997.  In addition, the registrant intends to
continue purchasing model homes as quickly as transactions can be negotiated
with developers and financing obtained.  

                                      (12)

In September 1996, the Company purchased a 70 acre tract of land in Boca
Raton, Florida, which will be developed into 370 home sites.  The land
is currently generating monthly option fee revenues in excess of $85,000.
Following completion of the development (approximately six months
following date of acquisition in September 1996),  revenues to the
Registrant from option fees and sales of developed lots  will be a minimum
of $1,250,000 per calendar quarter, until completion of the project.

The following table illustrates JJFN Services, Inc.'s growth in assets and
revenues since inception.
