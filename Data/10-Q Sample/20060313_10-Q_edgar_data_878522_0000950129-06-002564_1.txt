(1) Restatement 

In connection with the filing of the 2005 Form 10-K, the Company reported that it was
restating its consolidated financial statements for fiscal years 2004 and 2003, all the quarters
therein and the first three quarters of fiscal year 2005. These restatements have resulted in the
restatement of the condensed consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows for the first
quarter of fiscal year 2005 included in this Form 10-Q. The restatements are primarily the result
of:

(A) 
       
     The incorrect determination of operating and reportable segments and reporting units
related to the application of FASB Statement No. 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,  ( SFAS No. 142 ), which also had the effect of changing the charges recorded for
the assets sold as part of the Company s plan initiated in December 2003 (see Note 13) to
sell a number of businesses, and the net book value of assets held for sale on its balance
sheet. 

(B) 
       
     Errors identified in revenue recognition of preneed cemetery merchandise and services
contracts and recognition of realized trust earnings on preneed cemetery and funeral
merchandise and services contracts. 

(C) 
       
     Other miscellaneous adjustments, including adjustments for lease-related accounting
practices. 

The restatement for these errors is discussed in more detail below.

Segments and Reporting Units 

The Company re-evaluated its application of FASB Statement No. 131,  Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information  ( SFAS No. 131 ), and determined that it had
incorrectly identified its operating and reportable segments for all prior periods. The Company
concluded that it had eleven operating and reportable segments, which consisted of a corporate
trust management segment and a funeral and cemetery segment for each of five geographic areas:
Central, Western, Eastern, Southern   Florida and All Other. The Company s historical
presentation of segment data had consisted of two operating and reportable segments, funeral and
cemetery. As part of the Company s strategic planning process, in the fourth quarter of 2005, the
Company reorganized and revised its operating divisions from four to two and revised its operating
and reportable segments. For further discussion of the Company s operating and reportable
segments, see Note 10.

The correction of the Company s operating segments had the related effect of requiring changes
in the Company s reporting units for purposes of goodwill
impairment testing under SFAS No. 142,
retroactive to the November 1, 2001 adoption date of SFAS No. 142. The Company s evaluation of
goodwill should have been performed to include 13 reporting units as opposed to the two reporting
units historically identified. As a result of the reorganization and revision of the Company s
divisions effective for the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company revised its evaluation of goodwill
based upon 11 reporting units.

The restatement of the Company s operating segments and reporting units resulted in the need
to correct its goodwill impairment reviews as of November 1, 2001 (the date the Company adopted
SFAS No. 142) and as of October
31, 2002, 2003 and 2004. Consequently, the Company recorded a $209,400 ($193,090 after tax, or
$1.78 per diluted share) charge on November 1, 2001 as a cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle for the adoption of SFAS No. 142. The Company s previously reported financial statements
did not include a goodwill impairment charge upon the initial adoption of SFAS No. 142 on November
1, 2001 or during its annual assessment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002. The Company
also restated its previously reported fiscal year 2003 goodwill impairment charge of $73,000
($66,900 after tax, or $.62 per share) because based on its revised reporting units, no goodwill
impairment charge for the year ended October 31, 2003 was necessary.

Further, the restatement of goodwill on the Company s balance sheet had the effect of changing
the net book value of the assets the Company sold as part of the Company s plan to sell a number of
its businesses and the net book value of assets held for sale on the Company s balance sheet.

(1) Restatement (Continued) 

Deferred Revenue Project 

In connection with the Company s internal control assessment under Section 404 of
Sarbanes-Oxley, it undertook a project (the  deferred revenue project ) in 2005 to verify the
balances in deferred preneed cemetery revenue and deferred preneed funeral revenue by reviewing
substantially all of the preneed cemetery and funeral service and merchandise contracts included in
its backlog. This process involved the review of nearly 700,000 preneed contracts. The deferred
revenue project resulted in the Company s assessment that the recorded amount of deferred revenue
and revenue associated with cemetery merchandise and funeral service and merchandise contracts were
misstated, and therefore, the Company needed to correct and restate its prior period financial statements for
fiscal years 2001 through 2004, including the quarters therein, and the first three quarters of
2005. The Company also identified errors in the amounts of recorded realized trust earnings and
deferred realized trust earnings for these periods. Deferred realized trust earnings are included
in deferred preneed funeral revenue and deferred preneed cemetery revenue prior to recognition as
revenues. The adjustment impacted the cumulative effect of adopting SAB No. 101 on November 1,
2000, and reported revenues and earnings for fiscal years 2001 through 2004 and the first three
quarters of 2005.

The errors to deferred preneed revenues discussed above also resulted in restatements to the
amount of preneed selling costs recorded upon the adoption of SAB No. 101, and in subsequent years
and also the charge for the 2005 cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to
preneed selling costs adopted effective November 1, 2004. See Note 3(a).

The overall impact of the restatements related to the deferred revenue project on net earnings
and net earnings per share for the three months ended January 31, 2005 was a decrease in net
earnings of $13,560 (including $11,862, or $.11 per share, related to the cumulative effect of
change in accounting principle for preneed selling costs), and a decrease in earnings per share of
$.12, respectively.

Other Adjustments 

As previously disclosed in the Company s Form 10-Q for the second quarter of fiscal year 2005,
the Company reviewed its lease-related accounting practices and determined that certain adjustments
related to rent escalations and
leasehold improvement amortization were necessary. The cumulative effect of these adjustments for
all prior periods amounted to a charge of $1,839 ($1,149 after tax, or $.01 per share). The
Company evaluated the materiality of these operating lease adjustments on its financial statements
and concluded that the impact of these adjustments was not material. As a result, the Company
recorded the cumulative effect of these prior period adjustments of $1,839 as non-cash charges to
funeral and cemetery costs in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005. Because the Company amended
its financial statements for the restatements discussed above, the Company is now required to
record the lease adjustments in the periods they were actually incurred.

A summary of the effects of the restatements described above on the Company s condensed
consolidated financial statements for the three months ended January 31, 2005 is presented below.

(2) Basis of Presentation 

(a)  The Company 

The Company is a provider of funeral and cemetery products and services in the death care
industry in the United States. Through its subsidiaries, the Company offers a complete line of
funeral merchandise and services, along with cemetery property, merchandise and services, both at
the time of need and on a preneed basis. As of January 31, 2006, the Company owned and operated
231 funeral homes and 144 cemeteries in 26 states within the United States and Puerto Rico. The
Company has five operating and reportable segments consisting of a corporate trust management
segment and a funeral and cemetery segment for each of two geographic areas: Eastern and Western.

(b)  Principles of Consolidation 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the Company and its
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

(c)  Interim Disclosures 

The information as of January 31, 2006, and for the three months ended January 31, 2006 and
2005, is unaudited but, in the opinion of management, reflects all adjustments, which are of a
normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and results of
operations for the interim periods. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005.

The October 31, 2005 condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited
financial statements in the Company s 2005 Form 10-K, but does not include all disclosures required
by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which are presented in
the Company s 2005 Form 10-K.

The results of operations for the three months ended January 31, 2006 are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2006.

(d)  Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(e)  Share-Based Compensation 

As of January 31, 2006, the Company had three share-based compensation plans, which are
described in more detail in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements of the Company s 2005
Form 10-K. Prior to November 1, 2005, the Company accounted for those plans under the recognition
and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board ( APB ) Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees  and adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123,  Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation  and SFAS No. 148,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -
Transition and Disclosure   an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123.  No stock-based employee
compensation cost related to stock options was reflected in net earnings, as all options granted
under those plans had an exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of the underlying
common stock on the grant date. Accordingly, share-based compensation related to stock options was
only included as a pro forma disclosure in the financial statement footnotes.

Effective November 1, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R,  Share-Based Payment,  using
the modified prospective application transition method. Under this transition method,
compensation cost in 2006 includes the portion vesting in the period for (1) all share-based
payments granted prior to, but not vested as of November 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair
value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123 and (2) all share-based
payments granted subsequent to November 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Under the modified prospective application
transition method, no cumulative effect of change in accounting principle charge is required for
the Company, and results for prior periods have not been restated. See below for the pro forma
disclosures related to the three months ended January 31, 2005. SFAS No. 123R also requires excess
tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than an operating cash inflow.

Net earnings for the three months ended January 31, 2006 includes $424 ($275 after tax) of
share-based compensation costs and is included in corporate general and administrative expenses in
the condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the three months ended January 31, 2006. As
of January 31, 2006, there was $4,091 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested
share-based compensation that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.41
years. Based on current grants, total share-based compensation cost for fiscal year 2006 is
expected to be approximately $1,658.

On November 29, 2005, the Company granted new options to employees for the purchase of 269,250
shares of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $5.06 per share, which vest in equal 25
percent portions on November 29, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. These options expire on November 29,
2012. These were the only options granted during the quarter ended January 31, 2006. There were
no stock option exercises during the quarter ended January 31, 2006. A summary of option activity
under the plans for the three months ended January 31, 2006 is as follows:

(2) Basis of Presentation   (Continued) 

The following table further describes the Company s stock options outstanding as of
January 31, 2006.

The fair value of the Company s stock options is the estimated present value at grant date
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for
the quarter ended January 31, 2006: expected dividend yield of 0.3 percent; expected volatility of
54.9 percent; risk-free interest rate of 3.5 percent; and an expected term of 7.8 years. The
following were the weighted average assumptions for 2005: expected dividend yield of zero percent;
expected volatility of 43.3 percent; risk-free interest rate of 4.4 percent; and an expected term
of 4.3 years. The expected dividend yield is based on the Company s annual dividend payout at
grant date. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock for a
period approximating the expected life. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury
yield in effect at the time of grant and has a term equal to the expected life. The expected term
of the options represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding.

The expense related to restricted stock that was granted in fiscal year 2005 and 2004 is
reflected in earnings and amounted to $95 and $145 for the three months ended January 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively. The following table illustrates the effect on net loss and net loss per share
if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based
employee compensation for the three months ended January 31, 2005.

Basis of Presentation   (Continued) 

(f)  Reclassifications 

Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2005 condensed consolidated statements of
earnings and cash flows in order for these periods to be comparable. All businesses sold in fiscal
year 2006 and fiscal year 2005 that met the criteria for discontinued operations have been
classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. These reclassifications had no
effect on net earnings or shareholders  equity.

(3) Change in Accounting Principles and New Accounting Principles 

(a)  Preneed Selling Costs 

On May 31, 2005, the Company changed its method of accounting for preneed selling costs
incurred related to the acquisition of new prearranged funeral and cemetery service and merchandise
sales. The Company has applied this change in accounting principle effective November 1, 2004.
Prior to this change, commissions and other costs that varied with and were primarily related to
the acquisition of new prearranged funeral and cemetery service and merchandise sales were deferred
and included in deferred charges and amortized in proportion to preneed revenue recognized during
the period in a manner consistent with SFAS No. 60,  Accounting and Reporting for Insurance
Companies.  The Company decided to change its accounting for preneed selling costs to expense such
costs as incurred. The Company concluded that expensing these costs as they are incurred would be
preferable to the old method because it will make its reported results more comparable with other
public death care companies, better align the costs of obtaining preneed contracts with the cash
outflows associated with obtaining such contracts and eliminate the burden of maintaining deferred
selling cost records.

As of November 1, 2004, the Company recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle of $254,241 ($153,180 after tax, or $1.40 per diluted share), which represents the
cumulative balance of deferred preneed selling costs in the deferred charges line on the Company s
condensed consolidated balance sheet at the time of the change.

(b)  Other Accounting Pronouncements 

In December 2004, the FASB revised its SFAS No. 123 ( SFAS No. 123R ),  Accounting for Stock
Based Compensation.  The revision establishes standards for the accounting of transactions in
which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, particularly transactions
in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. The revised
statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange
for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost is
to be recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in
exchange for the award. Changes in fair value during the requisite service period are to be
recognized as compensation cost over that period. In addition, the revised statement amends SFAS
No. 95,  Statement of Cash Flows,  to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing
cash flow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R on November
1, 2005. See Note 2(e) for a discussion of the impact of adopting this statement in the first
quarter of 2006.

(4) Preneed Funeral Activities 

Preneed Funeral Receivables and Trust Investments 

Preneed funeral receivables and trust investments represent trust assets and customer
receivables related to unperformed, price-guaranteed trust-funded preneed funeral contracts. The
components of preneed funeral receivables and trust investments in the condensed consolidated
balance sheet at January 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005 are as follows:

(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 

(4) Preneed Funeral Activities (Continued) 

The cost and market values associated with preneed funeral merchandise and services trust
assets at January 31, 2006 are detailed below. The adjusted cost basis of the funeral merchandise
and services trust assets below reflect an other than temporary decline in the trust assets of
approximately $82,597 as of January 31, 2006 from their original cost basis. The Company believes
the unrealized losses reflected below of $9,654 related to trust investments are temporary in
nature.

The estimated maturities and market values of debt securities included above are as follows:

During the three months ended January 31, 2006, purchases and sales of available for sale
securities included in trust investments were $4,412 and $2,123, respectively. These sales

Henrietta Torres and Teresa Fiore, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated
and the General Public v. Stewart Enterprises, Inc., et al. ; No. BC328961 on the docket of the
Superior Court for the State of California for the County of Los Angeles, Central District. This
purported class action was filed on February 17, 2005, on behalf of a nationwide class defined to
include all persons, entities and organizations who purchased funeral goods and/or services in the
United States from defendants at any time on or after February 17, 2001. The suit named the
Company and several of its Southern California affiliates as defendants and also sought to assert
claims against a class of all entities located anywhere in the United States whose ultimate parent
corporation has been the Company at any time on or after February 17, 2001.

In May, 2005, the court ruled that this case was related to similar actions against Service
Corporation International ( SCI ) and Alderwoods Group, Inc., and designated the SCI case as the
lead case. The case against the

(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

      Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)  

Company effectively has been held in abeyance while the court tests plaintiff s legal theories in
the lead case. Rulings on legal issues in the lead case will apply equally in the case against
the Company, and the court has allowed the Company to participate in hearings and briefings in the
lead case.

As a result of demurrers, the plaintiff in the lead case has amended her complaint twice. On
January 31, 2006, however, the court overruled SCI s demurrer to the third amended complaint and
established a schedule leading to hearing on a motion for summary judgment in early July to test
the viability of the named plaintiff s claim against SCI.

The third amended complaint in the lead case alleges that the SCI defendants violated the
 Funeral Rule  promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission by failing to disclose that the prices
of certain goods and services they obtained from third parties specifically on the plaintiff s
behalf exceeded what the defendants paid for them. The plaintiff alleges that by failing to comply
with the Funeral Rule, defendants (i) breached contracts with the plaintiffs, (ii) were unjustly
enriched, and (iii) engaged in unfair, unlawful and fraudulent business practices in violation of a
provision of California s Business and Professions Code. The plaintiff seeks restitution damages,
disgorgement, interest, costs, and attorneys  fees.

Although the plaintiffs have amended their complaint against the Company once as a result of a
demurrer in the lead case, they have not amended their complaint to correspond with the third
amended complaint in the lead case. Because the matter is in its early stages, the likelihood of
liability and the extent of any damages cannot be reasonably assessed at this time. The Company
intends to aggressively defend itself in this matter.

In re: Funeral Consumer Antitrust Litigation     On May 2, 2005, a purported class action
lawsuit entitled  Funeral Consumers Alliance, Inc, et al. v. Service Corporation International,
Alderwoods Group, Inc., Stewart Enterprises, Inc., Hillenbrand Industries, Inc., and Batesville
Casket Co.  ( FCA Case ) was filed in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of
California, on behalf of a nationwide class defined to include all consumers who purchased a
Batesville casket from the funeral home defendants.

The suit alleges that the defendants acted jointly to reduce competition from independent
casket discounters and fix and maintain prices on caskets in violation of the federal antitrust
laws and California s Business and Professions Code. The plaintiffs seek treble damages,
restitution, injunctive relief, interest, costs and attorneys  fees.

Thereafter, five substantially similar lawsuits were filed in the Northern District of
California asserting claims under the federal antitrust laws and various state antitrust and
consumer protection laws. These five suits were transferred to the division in which the  FCA Case 
was pending and consolidated with the FCA Case (collectively referred to as the  Consolidated
Consumer Cases ).

On July 8, 2005, a purported class action was filed in the Northern District of California
entitled  Pioneer Valley Casket Co., Inc., et al. v. Service Corporation International, Alderwoods
Group, Inc., Stewart Enterprises, Inc., Hillenbrand Industries, Inc., and Batesville Casket Co. 
(  Pioneer Valley  Case ). The Pioneer Valley Case involves the same claims asserted in the
Consolidated Consumer Cases, except that it was brought on behalf of a nationwide class defined to
include only independent casket retailers.

On July 15, 2005, the defendants filed motions to dismiss for failure to plead facts
sufficient to establish viable antitrust and unfair competition claims. On September 9, 2005, the
Court denied the defendants  motions to dismiss, without prejudice, but ordered the plaintiffs to
file an amended and consolidated complaint that satisfies the objections raised in the motions to
dismiss.

At the defendants  request, the Court also issued orders in late September 2005 transferring
the Consolidated Consumer Cases and the Pioneer Valley Case to the United States District Court for
the Southern District of Texas. The transferred Consolidated Consumer Cases have been consolidated
before a single judge in the Southern District of Texas.
The Pioneer Valley Case has been consolidated with these cases for purposes of discovery only.

      Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)  

On October 12, 2005, the consumer plaintiffs filed a first amended consolidated class action
complaint. Defendants then filed motions to dismiss the first amended complaint, which are pending.
On October 21, 2005, Pioneer Valley filed a first amended complaint. Defendants then filed motions
to dismiss, which are pending. Discovery is underway in both cases. Because these matters are in
their preliminary stages, the likelihood of liability and the extent of any damages cannot be
reasonably assessed at this time. The Company intends to aggressively defend itself in these
matters.

A similar action captioned  Ralph Lee Fancher, on behalf of himself and all others similarly
situated v. Service Corporation International, Alderwoods Group, Inc,. Stewart Enterprises, Inc.,
Hillenbrand Industries, Inc., Aurora Casket Co., York Group, Inc., and Batesville Casket Co.,  was
filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee on behalf of
consumers in twenty-three states and the District of Columbia who purchased caskets. The
allegations of fact were essentially the same as those made in the FCA Case ,  but the plaintiff in
this suit alleged that the defendants violated state antitrust, consumer protection and/or unjust
enrichment laws. The plaintiff in this purported class action withdrew his complaint on August 2,
2005, and re-filed a nearly identical complaint under Tennessee law and on behalf of only Tennessee
consumers in the Northern District of California on September 23, 2005, the same day that the
Consolidated Consumer Cases were transferred to the Southern District of Texas. This matter has
now been transferred to the Southern District of Texas, and consolidated with the Consolidated
Consumer Cases for purposes of discovery. The plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint expanding
the purported class to include  all individuals and entities in the United States who purchased
Batesville caskets  and dropping claims made under the Tennessee consumer protection law. Because
these matters are in their preliminary stages, the likelihood of liability and the extent of any
damages cannot be reasonably assessed at this time. The Company intends to aggressively defend
itself in these matters.

State Attorney General Civil Investigative Demands    On August 4, 2005, the Attorney General
for the State of Maryland issued a civil investigative demand to the Company seeking documents and
information relating to funeral and cemetery goods and services. The Attorney General for the
State of Florida issued a similar civil investigative demand to the Company. The Company is
cooperating with the attorneys general and has begun providing them with information relevant to
their investigations. Because these matters are in their preliminary stages, the likelihood of
liability and the extent of any damages cannot be reasonably assessed at this time. The Company
intends to aggressively defend itself in these matters.

In addition to the matters above, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries are parties to a
number of other legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. While the
outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not expect these
matters to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows of the Company.

The Company is required to maintain a bond of $41,061 to guarantee its obligations relating to
funds it withdrew in fiscal year 2001 from its preneed funeral trusts in Florida. The Company
substituted a bond to guarantee performance under certain preneed funeral contracts and agreed to
maintain unused credit facilities in an amount that will equal or exceed the bond amount. The
Company believes that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to cover its estimated cost of
providing the prearranged services and products in the future. During the first quarter of 2006,
the Company posted an $11,000 letter of credit in order to secure the bond. In addition, the
Company has $12,870 of other outstanding letters of credit posted during the normal course of
business.

As of January 31, 2006, there were no amounts drawn on the Company s $125,000 revolving credit
facility. As of January 31, 2006, the Company s availability under the revolving credit facility,
after giving consideration to the aforementioned letters of credit and remaining bond obligation,
was $71,069.

The Company carries insurance with coverages and coverage limits that it believes to be adequate.
Although there can be no assurance that such insurance is sufficient to protect the Company against
all contingencies,

(9) Reconciliation of Basic and Diluted Per Share Data (Continued) 

The Company includes Class A and Class B common stock in its diluted shares calculation. As
of January 31, 2006, the Company s Chairman Emeritus, Frank B. Stewart, Jr., was the record holder
of all of the Company s shares of Class B common stock. The Company s Class A and B common stock
are substantially identical, except that holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote
per share, and holders of Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share. Each share of
Class B common stock is automatically converted into one share of Class A common stock upon
transfer to persons other than certain affiliates of Frank B. Stewart, Jr.

The Company re-evaluated its application of FASB Statement No. 131,  Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information  ( SFAS No. 131 ), and restated its operating and
reportable segments during fiscal year 2005 to include eleven operating and reportable segments.
The Company s historical presentation of segment data had incorrectly consisted of two operating
and reportable segments, funeral and cemetery. As a result of the Company s strategic planning
process, effective for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, the Company reorganized its
operating divisions from four to two and revised its operating and reportable segments accordingly.
The Company s new presentation as a result of its strategic planning process reflects five
operating and reportable segments consisting of a corporate trust management segment and a funeral
and cemetery segment for each of two geographic areas: Western and Eastern. The Company
does not aggregate its operating segments. Therefore, its operating and reportable segments are
the same.

The corporate trust management segment revenues reflect (1) investment management fees earned
and (2) the realized earnings related to preneed contracts delivered, which are the earnings
realized over the life of the contracts delivered during the relevant period. Earnings recognition
in this segment is unrelated to investment results in the current period. Current investment
results of the funeral and cemetery merchandise and service trusts are deferred and are not
reflected in the statement of earnings but are disclosed in Notes 4, 5, and 7 along with the cost
and market value of the trust assets. The Company s fee income related to management of its trust
assets, the investment income recognized on preneed contracts delivered and the trust assets are
referred to as  corporate trust management  for the benefit of the divisions.

Perpetual care trust earnings are reported in the geographic segments, as these revenues are
recognized currently and are used to maintain the cemeteries. Perpetual care trust earnings and
the cost and market values of the perpetual care trust assets are presented in Note 6.

The accounting policies of the Company s segments are the same as those described in Note 3 to
the consolidated financial statements included in the Company s 2005 Form 10-K. The Company
evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources to them using a variety of
profitability metrics. The most comprehensive of these measures is gross profit.

The Company also measures its preneed sales growth year-over-year. Although the Company does
not consider its preneed selling activities to be a separate segment, the Company is providing
additional disclosure of preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and service sales in its segment
footnote as preneed sales are reviewed monthly by the Company s CODM to assess performance and
allocate resources. Preneed sales are strategically significant to the Company as those sales are
one of the primary drivers of market share protection and growth. That is because preneed selling
not only adds to the Company s backlog but also strengthens at-need performance in the near-term.
As such, the CODM reviews the preneed sales data in addition to revenue and gross profit.

The Company s operations are product-based and geographically-based. As such, the Company s
primary reportable segments presented in the following table are based on products and services and
their geographical orientation.

The Company s funeral homes offer a complete range of funeral services and products both at
the time of need and on a preneed basis. The Company s services and products include family
consultation, removal and preparation of
remains, the use of funeral home facilities for visitation, worship and funeral services,
transportation services, flowers and caskets. In addition to traditional funeral services, all of
the Company s funeral homes offer

cremation products and services. The Company s cemetery operations involve the sale of cemetery
property and related merchandise, including lots, lawn crypts, family and community mausoleums,
monuments, memorials and burial vaults, along with the sale of burial site openings and closings
and inscriptions. Cemetery property and merchandise sales are made both at the time of need and on
a preneed basis.

The Company incurs certain costs at the divisional or regional level which benefit all of the
funeral homes and cemeteries in the division or region such as division management compensation,
divisional and regional headquarters overhead, insurance costs or legal and professional fees.
These costs are allocated to the facilities in the regions or divisions using various methods
including their proportionate share of sales (which can include preneed sales) or payroll. These
costs are included in funeral and cemetery costs.

The Company incurs certain other costs at its Shared Services Center which benefit all of the
funeral homes and cemeteries, such as the costs to process contracts, make collections, pay
vendors, deliver information system services and deliver human resource services. These costs are
allocated to the divisions and further allocated to the facilities in the division using various
methods including their proportionate share of sales (which can include preneed sales) and the
number of employees. These costs are included in funeral and cemetery costs.

The operating results of the Company s businesses sold that meet the discontinued operations
criteria in SFAS No. 144 are reported in the discontinued operations section of the consolidated
statements of earnings (see Note 13). The table below presents information about reported segments
for the Company s continuing operations.

(1)  
       
     Perpetual care trust earnings are included in the revenues and gross profit of
the related geographic segment and amounted to $2,618 and $1,122 for the three months ended
January 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

     Corporate trust management consists of trust management fees and funeral and

are established by the Company at rates consistent with industry norms and are paid by the
trusts to the Company s subsidiary, Investor s Trust, Inc. The trust earnings represent
earnings realized over the life of the preneed contracts delivered during the relevant periods.
Trust management fees included in funeral revenue for the three months ended January 31, 2006
and 2005 were $1,367 and $1,153, respectively, and funeral trust earnings for the three months
ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 were $3,285 and $3,325, respectively. Trust management fees
included in cemetery revenue for the three months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 were $1,206
and $1,231, respectively, and cemetery trust earnings for the three months ended January 31,
2006 and 2005 were $1,401 and $1,473, respectively.

(13) Discontinued Operations, Assets Held for Sale and Impairment Charges 

In December 2003, the Company announced plans to close or sell a number of small businesses,
primarily small funeral homes, most of which were acquired as part of a group of facilities, that
were performing below acceptable levels or no longer fit the Company s operating profile. One of
the criteria for classification as discontinued operations or assets held for sale is that the
transfer of the asset is normally expected to qualify for accounting recognition as a sale within
one year s time, with certain exceptions. Certain of the businesses classified as discontinued
operations during the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 that were not sold within the one-year
requirement were reclassified as continuing operations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005.
The operating results of those businesses that met the criteria in SFAS No. 144 that were sold
during fiscal years 2006 or 2005 are currently reported in the discontinued operations
section of the 2006 and 2005 consolidated statements of earnings. There were no businesses
sold in the first quarter of 2006.

The Company recorded net gains on dispositions and impairment (losses) of $298 and $878 for
the three months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 in continuing operations, respectively, for
long-lived assets sold, primarily real estate, that did not qualify as discontinued operations.
The Company also recorded net gains on dispositions and impairment (losses) related to discontinued
operations of $543 for the three months ended January 31, 2005, which is reflected in the
discontinued operations section of the consolidated statement of earnings, all of which relates to
businesses sold.

The operating results of the discontinued operations for the three months ended January 31,
2005, are set forth below:

(14) Separation Charges 

On July 14, 2005, the Company named a new Chief Operating Officer and announced that it was
reorganizing its divisions. The reorganization consolidated operations from four divisions to two:
Eastern and Western. These changes are a result of the Company s recent strategic planning
process and became effective for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005. The total charge for
severance and other costs associated with the reorganization including relocation costs of certain
personnel, exit of the leases associated with certain administrative facilities and charges
associated with certain leasehold improvements of the related leases is expected to be
approximately $1,850. During fiscal year 2005, the Company recorded $1,507 ($942 after tax, or
$.01 per share) in related costs. During the quarter ended January 31, 2006, the Company recorded
a charge of $154 for these costs. As of January 31, 2006, the Company has paid $773 of these
costs. There are no material remaining costs under the reorganization.

(15) Consolidated Comprehensive Income 

Consolidated comprehensive income (loss) for the three months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005
is as follows:

(16) Guarantees 

The Company s obligations under its senior secured credit facility and 6.25 percent senior
notes are guaranteed by all of its existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries formed
under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, except for
specified excluded subsidiaries. For additional information regarding the senior secured credit
facility and the 6.25 percent senior notes, see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements of
the Company s 2005 Form 10-K.

All obligations under the senior secured credit facility, including the guarantees and any
interest rate protection and other hedging agreements with any lender or its affiliates, are
secured by a first priority perfected security interest in (1) all capital stock and other equity
interests of the Company s existing and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries, other
than certain domestic subsidiaries acceptable to the agents, (2) 65 percent of the voting equity
interests and 100 percent of all other equity interests (other than qualifying shares of directors)
of all direct existing and future foreign subsidiaries, and (3) all other existing and future
assets and properties of the Company and the guarantors, except for real property, vehicles and
other specified exclusions.

Louisiana law gives Louisiana corporations broad powers to indemnify their present and former
directors and officers and those of affiliated corporations against expenses incurred in the
defense of any lawsuit to which they are made parties by reason of their positions. The Company s
By-laws make mandatory the indemnification of directors and officers permitted by Louisiana law.
The Company has in effect a directors  and officers  liability insurance policy that provides for
indemnification of its officers and directors against losses arising from claims asserted against
them in their capacities as officers and directors, subject to limitations and conditions set forth
in such policy. The Company has also entered into indemnity agreements with each director and
executive officer, pursuant to which the Company has agreed, subject to certain exceptions, to
purchase and maintain directors  and officers  liability insurance. The agreements also provide
that the Company will indemnify each director and executive officer against any costs and expenses,
judgments, settlements and fines incurred in connection with any claim involving him or her by
reason of his or her position as director or officer, provided that the director or executive
officer meets certain standards of conduct.

As of January 31, 2006, the Company has guaranteed long-term debt of its subsidiaries of
approximately $794 that represents notes the subsidiaries issued as part of the purchase price of
acquired businesses or debt the subsidiaries assumed in connection with acquisitions.

(17) Related Party Transactions 

In July 2005, the Company announced the retirement of Michael K. Crane, Sr., Senior Vice
President and President of the Central Division, effective October 31, 2005. As part of his
separation agreement, he is entitled to receive $300 in equal installments over a two year period
beginning in May 2006. The Company recorded the $300 charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2005 but will make the payments in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

In June 2004, the Company entered into a separation agreement with William E. Rowe, who
stepped down from his position as President and Chief Executive Officer. As part of Mr. Rowe s
separation agreement, the Company is paying Mr. Rowe $1,000 in equal installments over a two year
period, beginning November 1, 2004. The Company recorded the $1,000 charge in the third quarter of
fiscal year 2004 but will make the payments in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

In July 2003, the Company entered into a retirement benefits agreement with Frank B. Stewart,
Jr., who retired from his position as Chairman of the Board and became Chairman Emeritus of the
Company. As part of Mr. Stewart s retirement benefits agreement, the Company agreed to pay Mr.
Stewart $1,650, payable in three installments of $550 each. The Company recorded the $1,650 charge
in the third quarter of 2003 and paid all of the $1,650 commitment as of June 20, 2005.

In June 2003, the Company announced that Brian J. Marlowe, Chief Operating Officer, had
stepped down. According to the terms of his employment agreement, he was entitled to receive an
amount equal to two years of salary, or $800, over the next two years. The Company recorded the
$800 charge in the third quarter of 2003 and paid all of the $800 commitment as of June 17, 2005.

In January 1998, the Company discontinued an insurance policy on the life of Mr. Frank B.
Stewart, Jr., Chairman Emeritus of the Company. In order to purchase a replacement policy, The
Stewart Family Special Trust borrowed $685 from the Company pursuant to a promissory note due 180
days after the death of Mr. Stewart. Interest on the note accrues annually at a rate equal to the
Company s cost of borrowing under its revolving credit facility and is payable when the principal
becomes due. The amount of the loan was equal to the cash value received by the Company upon the
discontinuance of the prior insurance policy. The loan proceeds were used by the trust to purchase
a single premium policy on the life of Mr. Stewart. Certain of the beneficiaries of The Stewart
Family Special Trust are members of Mr. Stewart s family. The loan was approved by all of the
disinterested members of the Board of Directors. The outstanding balance of the loan at January
31, 2006, including accrued interest, was approximately $1,066.

(18) Hurricane Related Charges 

On Monday, August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the New Orleans metropolitan area and the
Mississippi and Alabama Gulf Coasts. The Company s executive offices and Shared Services Center
are located in a building it owns in the New Orleans metropolitan area, and no significant damage
occurred to that building. However, most of the approximately 400 employees who work at this
location did not have access to their homes until late September or early October, and many of
those homes remain uninhabitable. For the month of September, the Company temporarily housed most
of the Shared Services Center functions, such as cash receipts and disbursements, customer service,
contract processing and information technology in Orlando, Florida, in newly-leased and existing
Company office space, and temporarily housed other functions such as the executive offices,
treasury, accounting, trust administration, human resources, training, communications, marketing,
tax and compliance in the Dallas, Texas area in newly-leased office space. As of October 31, 2005,
the Company had used approximately $2,500 in cash on hand for hurricane related expenses. Beginning in early
October, the executive offices and Shared Services Center were open and operating.

Of the Company s 231 funeral homes and 144 cemeteries, three funeral homes and five
cemeteries, which prior to the hurricane represented approximately four percent of the Company s
annual revenues and approximately

(18) Hurricane Related Charges (Continued) 

five percent of its annual gross profit, are located in the New
Orleans metropolitan area, have suffered substantial damage and are conducting business in
temporary facilities until repairs are completed. The Company s mausoleum construction and sales
business, Acme Mausoleum, which primarily operates in southwest Louisiana and Texas, was also
negatively impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Including Acme Mausoleum, the New Orleans area
funeral home and cemetery operations represented approximately six percent of the Company s annual
revenue and gross profit prior to the hurricane. The book value of net property and equipment,
receivables, inventory and cemetery property at the affected properties amounted to approximately
$24,700 prior to the storms (of which approximately $13,267 was written off as described below).

Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma also interrupted business in Florida, Alabama, Mississippi
and Texas primarily due to evacuations and power-outages. The Company has insurance coverage
related to property damage, incremental costs and property operating expenses it incurred due to
damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. As of January 31, 2006, the Company had incurred approximately
$23,735 (of which $20,897 was incurred as of October 31, 2005) in total expenses related to
Hurricane Katrina including the write-off of damaged buildings, equipment and inventory, demolition
costs, debris removal, record restoration, general cleanup, temporary living facilities for
employees, relocation expenses and other costs. The Company expects insurance proceeds of at least
$11,731 currently based on the status of its insurance review, $500 of which had been received as
of October 31, 2005 and $10,731 of which was received in the first quarter of 2006. The remaining
$500 in insurance proceeds to be received is included in current receivables in the consolidated
balance sheet for fiscal year 2006. The net amount of $2,638 ($1,583 after tax, or $.01 per share)
is included in the  Hurricane related charges, net  line in the consolidated statement of earnings
for fiscal year 2006. A charge of $9,366 in net hurricane related charges was recorded in fiscal
year 2005. The Company believes that a significant portion of the loss it experienced may be
covered by insurance. When the Company and its insurance carriers agree on the final amount of the
insurance proceeds the Company is entitled to, if the proceeds are greater than the loss incurred,
then the Company will record any related gain at that time.

(19) Long-term Debt 

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2005, the Company completed the refinancing of its
senior secured credit facility and recorded a charge for the early extinguishment of debt of $2,651
($1,723 after tax, or $.02 per share) to write off fees associated with the previous credit
facility. For additional information, see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements of the
Company s 2005 Form 10-K.

(20) Subsequent Events 

The Company received notifications from Nasdaq that its incomplete 2005 Third Quarter Report, the
delay in filing its 2005 Form 10-K and its incomplete 2004 Form 10-K/A are not in compliance with
the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14). The Nasdaq Listing
Qualifications Panel granted the Company s request for an extension of time to file the complete
2005 Third Quarter Report and the 2005 Form 10-K to February 15, 2006. On February 14, 2006, the
Company requested an additional extension of time to February 22, 2006 in which to file the 2005
Form 10-K and 2005 Third Quarter Report. The Company also requested an extension of time in which
to file the 2004 Form 10-K/A until April 7, 2006. Nasdaq granted these extensions. The Company
filed its 2005 Form 10-K on February 17, 2006 and filed the 2005 Third Quarter Report on February
22, 2006.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Restatement of Historical Financial Statements 

In connection with the filing of the 2005 Form 10-K, we reported that we were restating our
consolidated financial statements for fiscal years 2004 and 2003, all the quarters therein and the
first three quarters of fiscal year 2005. These restatements have resulted in the restatement of
the condensed consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows for the first quarter of fiscal
year 2005 included in this Form 10-Q. The restatements are primarily the result of:

(A) 
       
     The incorrect determination of operating and reportable segments and reporting units
related to the application of FASB Statement No. 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,  ( SFAS No. 142 ), which also had the effect of changing the charges recorded for
the assets sold as part of our plan initiated in December 2003 to sell a number of
businesses, and the net book value of assets held for sale on our balance sheet. 

(B) 
       
     Errors identified in revenue recognition of preneed cemetery merchandise and services
contracts and recognition of realized trust earnings on preneed cemetery and funeral
merchandise and services contracts. 

(C) 
       
     Other miscellaneous adjustments, including adjustments for lease-related accounting
practices. 

The restatement for these errors is discussed in more detail below.

Segments and Reporting Units 

We re-evaluated our application of FASB Statement No. 131,  Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information  ( SFAS No. 131 ), and determined that we had incorrectly
identified our operating and reportable segments for all prior periods. We concluded that we had
eleven operating and reportable segments, which consisted of a corporate trust management segment
and a funeral and cemetery segment for each of five geographic areas: Central, Western, Eastern,
Southern   Florida and All Other. Our historical presentation of segment data had consisted of two
operating and reportable segments, funeral and cemetery. As part of our strategic planning
process, in the fourth quarter of 2005, we organized and revised our operating divisions from four
to two and revised our operating and reportable segments. For further discussion of our operating
and reportable segments, see Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included
herein.

The correction of our operating segments had the related effect of requiring changes in our
reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing under SFAS No. 142, retroactive to the
November 1, 2001 adoption date of SFAS No. 142. Our evaluation of goodwill should have been
performed to include 13 reporting units as opposed to the two reporting units historically
identified. As a result of the reorganization and revision of our divisions effective for the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, we revised our evaluation of goodwill based upon 11 reporting
units.

The restatement of our operating segments and reporting units resulted in the need to correct
our goodwill impairment reviews as of November 1, 2001 (the date we adopted SFAS No. 142) and as of
October 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004. Consequently, we recorded a $209.4 million ($193.1 million after
tax, or $1.78 per diluted share) charge on November 1, 2001 as a cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle for the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Our previously reported financial
statements did not include a goodwill impairment charge upon the initial adoption of SFAS No. 142
on November 1, 2001 or during our annual assessment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002. We
also restated our previously reported fiscal year 2003 goodwill impairment charge of $73.0 million
($66.9 million after tax, or $.62 per share) because based on our revised reporting units, no
goodwill impairment charge for the year ended October 31, 2003 was necessary.

Further, the restatement of goodwill on our balance sheet had the effect of changing the net
book value of the assets we sold as part of our plan to sell a number of our businesses and the net
book value of assets held for sale on our balance sheet.

Deferred Revenue Project 

In connection with our internal control assessment under Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, we
undertook a project (the  deferred revenue project ) in 2005 to verify the balances in deferred
preneed cemetery revenue and deferred preneed funeral revenue by reviewing substantially all of the
preneed cemetery and funeral service and merchandise contracts included in our backlog. This
process involved the review of nearly 700,000 preneed contracts. The deferred revenue project
resulted in our assessment that deferred revenue and revenue associated with cemetery merchandise
and funeral service and merchandise contracts were misstated and
therefore we needed to correct and restate our
prior period financial statements for fiscal years 2001 through 2004, including the quarters
therein, and the first three quarters of 2005. We also identified errors in the amounts of
recorded realized trust earnings and deferred realized trust earnings for these periods. Deferred
realized trust earnings are included in deferred preneed funeral revenue and deferred preneed
cemetery revenue prior to recognition as revenues. The adjustment impacted the cumulative effect
of adopting SAB No. 101 on November 1, 2000, and reported revenues and earnings for fiscal years
2001 through 2004 and the first three quarters of 2005.

The errors to deferred preneed revenue discussed above also resulted in restatements to the
amount of preneed selling costs recorded upon the adoption of SAB No. 101, and in subsequent years
and also the charge for the 2005 cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to
preneed selling costs adopted effective November 1, 2004. See Note 3(a) to the condensed
consolidated financial statements included herein.

The overall impact of the restatements related to the deferred revenue project on net earnings
and net earnings per share for the three months ended January 31, 2005 was a decrease in net
earnings of $13.6 million (including $11.9 million, or $.11 per share, related to the cumulative
effect of change in accounting principle for preneed selling costs), and a decrease in earnings per
share of $.12, respectively.

Other Adjustments 

As previously disclosed in our Form 10-Q for the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, we
reviewed our lease-related accounting practices and determined that certain adjustments related to
rent escalations and leasehold improvement amortization were necessary. The cumulative effect of
these adjustments for all prior periods amounted to a charge of $1.8 million ($1.1 million after
tax, or $.01 per share). We evaluated the materiality of these operating lease adjustments on our
financial statements and concluded that the impact of these adjustments was not material. As a
result, we recorded the cumulative effect of these prior period adjustments of $1.8 million as
non-cash charges to funeral and cemetery costs in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005. Because
we have amended our financial statements for the restatements discussed above, we are now required
to record the lease adjustments in the periods they were actually incurred.

A summary of the effects of the restatements described above on our condensed consolidated
financial statements can be found in Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements
included herein.

Overview 

We are the third largest provider of funeral and cemetery products and services in the death
care industry in the United States. As of March 1, 2006, we owned and operated 230 funeral homes
and 144 cemeteries in 26 states within the United States and Puerto Rico.

We sell cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services both at the time of
need and on a preneed basis. Our revenues in each period are derived primarily from at-need sales,
preneed sales delivered out of our backlog during the period (including the accumulated trust
earnings or build-up in the face value of insurance contracts related to these preneed deliveries),
preneed cemetery property sales and other items such as perpetual care trust earnings and finance
charges. For a more detailed discussion of our accounting for preneed sales and trust and escrow
account earnings, see  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations  included in Item 7 in our 2005 Form 10-K.

For the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, we had net earnings of $8.4 million, compared to a
net loss of $145.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2005. Fiscal year 2005 results
include a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $153.2 million. Earnings from
continuing operations increased $1.0 million to $8.4

million for the first quarter of fiscal year
2006 compared to $7.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal
year 2005. Interest expense decreased $2.9 million.

Operating earnings decreased $3.8 million, from $24.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal
year 2005 to $20.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. Gross profit increased $1.9
million due to an increase in cemetery gross profit resulting primarily from increases in cemetery
property sales and perpetual care trust earnings. Excluding the three Louisiana funeral homes
damaged by Hurricane Katrina, same-store funeral services performed increased 3.3 percent;
including those funeral homes, the increase was 2.4 percent. Average revenue per funeral service
for our same-store business also increased. First quarter 2006 operating earnings also reflect an
increase of $3.0 million in corporate general and administrative expenses primarily due to
increased professional fees associated with our Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance effort,
increased legal and professional fees relating in part to the class action lawsuits, the increased
work performed during the first quarter of 2006 pertaining to SEC filings and the deferred revenue
project and an increase due to the implementation of SFAS No. 123R,  Share-Based Payment,  of $0.4
million of share-based compensation costs in the first quarter of 2006. We also recorded a $2.6
million charge related to Hurricane Katrina.

Cash flow from operations increased from ($1.9) million in the first quarter of fiscal year
2005 to $27.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. The increase is primarily due to
trust withdrawals associated with the deferred revenue project, the timing of interest payments and
the timing of customer collections. These increases in cash flow were partially offset by $2.1
million of cash outflows in excess of insurance proceeds received related to Hurricane Katrina.

For the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, we achieved an 8.7 percent increase in preneed
funeral sales and a 10.4 percent increase in gross cemetery property sales.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make estimates and
assumptions (see Note 2(d) to the condensed consolidated financial statements). Our critical
accounting policies are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition
and results of operations and require management s most difficult, subjective and complex judgment.
These critical accounting policies are discussed in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our 2005 Form
10-K. There have been no changes to
our critical accounting policies since the filing of our 2005 Form 10-K.

Results of Operations 

The following discussion segregates the financial results of our continuing operations into
our various segments, grouped by our funeral and cemetery operations. For a discussion of
discontinued operations, see Note 13 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included
herein. For a discussion of our segments, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements
included herein. As there have been no material acquisitions or construction of new locations in
fiscal years 2006 and 2005, results from continuing operations reflect those of same-store
locations.

Same-Store Analysis  (2) 

(1)  
       
     Corporate trust management consists of trust management fees and funeral
merchandise and service trust earnings recognized with respect to preneed contracts delivered
during the period. Trust management fees are established by us at rates consistent with
industry norms and are paid by the trusts to our subsidiary, Investor s Trust, Inc. The trust
earnings represent earnings realized over the life of the preneed contracts delivered during
the relevant periods. See Notes 4 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements included
herein for information regarding the cost basis and market value of the trust assets and
current performance of the trusts (i.e., current realized gains and losses, interest income
and dividends). Trust management fees included in funeral revenue for the three months ended
January 31, 2006 and 2005 were $1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively, and funeral trust
earnings for the three months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 were $3.3 million.

     On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the New Orleans metropolitan area and
severely damaged three of our funeral homes located in that area, which is part of our Western
division. This same-store analysis includes these three funeral homes which had revenue of
$1.5 million and $2.2 million for the three months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, and performed 359 and 476 funeral services in the first quarter of 2006 and
2005, respectively. Excluding these three funeral homes, the increase in average revenue per
call for the Western division and the Company was 2.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively,
and the change in same-store funeral services for the Western division and the Company was 4.8
percent and 3.3 percent, respectively. 

Consolidated Operations   Funeral 

Funeral revenue from continuing operations increased $2.1 million, or 3.0 percent, for the
three months ended January 31, 2006, compared to the corresponding period in 2005. The increase in
funeral revenue was primarily due to a 2.4 percent increase in the number of same-store funeral
services performed, or 384 events out of 15,727 total same-store funeral services performed.
Excluding the three Louisiana funeral homes damaged by Hurricane Katrina, same-store funeral
services performed increased 3.3 percent.

41

Table of Contents   

We also experienced an increase in the average revenue per funeral service performed by our
same-store businesses. Our same-store businesses achieved a 4.1 percent increase in the average
revenue per traditional funeral service and a 0.2 percent increase in the average revenue per
cremation service. The increase in the average revenue per traditional funeral service was offset
by an increase in the proportion of non-traditional funeral services, including cremations, which
experienced a smaller increase in average revenue than the traditional services, and resulted in an
overall 1.3 percent increase in the average revenue per funeral service for our same-store
businesses. We believe the primary factors that contributed to the increases in our average
revenue per traditional and cremation services were normal inflationary price increases, more
effective merchandising and packaging, our focus on training, customized funeral planning and
personalization and the funeral home incentive compensation plan.

Funeral gross profit margin from continuing operations decreased from 25.5 percent in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2005 to 24.8 percent in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. The
decrease is primarily due to an increase in funeral home staffing levels and an increase in preneed
selling costs. In our efforts to focus on customer service and in anticipation of growing our core
funeral businesses up to 2 percent in fiscal year 2006, we increased staffing levels in funeral
operations during the first quarter of 2006, resulting in increased payroll expenses when compared
to prior year. Additionally, as a result of the 8.7 percent increase in preneed funeral sales
occurring in the first quarter of 2006, the investment in preneed selling costs during the quarter
placed some downward pressure on funeral gross profit, as these preneed selling costs are expensed
as incurred. The increased preneed funeral sales are deferred into our backlog until the products
and services are delivered. The cremation rate for our same-store operations was 38.7 percent for
the three months ended January 31, 2006 compared to 37.0 percent for the corresponding period in
2005.

Segment Discussion   Funeral 

Funeral revenue in the Eastern division and Western division funeral segments increased
primarily due to an increase in the number of funeral services performed by the same-store
businesses of 1.3 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively, coupled with an increase in the average
revenue per funeral service in the same-store businesses of 1.6 percent and 1.7 percent,
respectively. Excluding the three Louisiana funeral homes damaged by Hurricane Katrina, the
increase in the number of funeral services performed and the increase in average revenue per call
in the Western division funeral segment were 4.8 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively. Funeral
revenue in the corporate trust management segment increased primarily due to the increase in trust
management fees.

Funeral gross profit margin for the Western division and Eastern division funeral segments
decreased primarily due to increased preneed selling costs and funeral staffing levels discussed
above. As demonstrated in the table above, the same-store cremation rate increased for the
Western division and Eastern division funeral segments.

earnings recognized with respect to preneed contracts delivered during the period. Trust
management fees are established by us at rates consistent with industry norms and are paid by the
trusts to our subsidiary, Investor s Trust, Inc. The trust earnings represent earnings realized
over the life of the preneed contracts delivered during the relevant periods. See Notes 5 and 7 to
the consolidated financial statements included herein for information regarding the cost basis and
market value of the trust assets and current performance of the trusts (i.e., current realized
gains and losses, interest income and dividends). Trust management fees included in cemetery
revenue for the three months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 were $1.2 million, and cemetery trust
earnings for the three months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 were $1.4 million and $1.5 million,
respectively. Perpetual care trust earnings are included in the revenues and gross profit of the
related geographic segment.

Consolidated Operations   Cemetery 

Cemetery revenue from continuing operations increased $2.0 million, or 3.8 percent, for the
three months ended January 31, 2006, compared to the corresponding period in 2005, primarily due to
increases in cemetery property sales and perpetual care trust earnings, partially offset by a
decrease in construction during the year on various cemetery projects. Revenue related to the
cemetery property prior to its construction is recognized on a percentage of completion method of
accounting as construction occurs. Gross cemetery property sales increased 10.4 percent in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2006 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 from $22.2
million to $24.5 million.

We experienced an annualized average return, excluding unrealized gains and losses, of 4.9
percent in our perpetual care trusts for the quarter ended January 31, 2006 resulting in revenue of
$2.6 million, compared to 3.8 percent for the corresponding period in 2005 resulting in revenue of
$1.1 million.

Cemetery gross profit margin from continuing operations increased from 17.8 percent in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2005 to 20.6 percent in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. The
overall increase resulted from increased revenues as discussed above.

Segment Discussion   Cemetery 

Cemetery revenue in the Eastern division segment increased primarily due to an increase in
preneed property sales and an increase in perpetual care trust earnings. Cemetery revenue in the
Western division segment decreased primarily due to a decrease in merchandise deliveries and a
decrease in construction during the year on various cemetery development projects. Revenue related
to the sale of cemetery property prior to its construction is recognized on a percentage of
completion method of accounting as construction occurs.

Cemetery gross profit margin for the Eastern division cemetery segment increased primarily due
to increased cemetery revenue as discussed above, and cemetery gross profit margin for the Western
division cemetery segment decreased due to the decrease in revenue discussed above.

Discontinued Operations 

The operating results of those businesses sold in fiscal years 2005 and 2006 are reported in
the discontinued operations section of the consolidated statements of earnings. There were no
businesses sold in the first quarter of 2006. Included in discontinued operations for the three
months ended January 31, 2005 were gains on dispositions and impairment (losses), net of $0.5
million. Revenues for the three months ended January 31, 2005 were $0.5 million.

Other 

Corporate general and administrative expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2006
increased $3.0 million compared to the same period in 2005 due to increased professional fees
associated with our Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance effort, increased legal and professional
fees relating in part to the class action law suits and the increased work performed during the
first quarter of 2006 pertaining to SEC filings and the deferred revenue project. Although we
expect professional fees in fiscal year 2006 to be significantly greater than fiscal year 2005, we
do not expect to sustain the level of professional fees we incurred in the first quarter of 2006.
We also recorded

$0.4 million in share-based compensation costs in the first quarter of 2006 due to the adoption of
SFAS No. 123R, as discussed in Note 2(e) to the condensed consolidated financial statements
included herein.

In July 2005, we named a new Chief Operating Officer and announced a reorganization of our
divisions from four to two, effective for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005. As a result of
these changes, we recorded charges of $1.5 million in fiscal year 2005 and $0.2 million for the
three months ended January 31, 2006. These charges are presented in the  Separation charges  line
item in the consolidated statements of earnings.

For the three months ended January 31, 2006, we had recorded net expenses of $2.6 million
related to Hurricane Katrina. For additional information, see Note 18 to the condensed
consolidated financial statements included herein.

Total depreciation and amortization and depreciation and amortization from continuing
operations were $5.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 compared to $5.3 million for
the same period in 2005.

Interest expense decreased $2.9 million to $7.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal year
2006 compared to $10.4 million for the same period in 2005 primarily due to a 259 basis-point
decrease in the average interest rate during the period resulting from debt refinancings occurring
in 2005, combined with a $1.4 million decrease in average debt outstanding.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003, we identified a number of small businesses to
close or sell, mostly funeral homes, and determined that their carrying value exceeded their fair
values. For the three months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, we reported net gains on
dispositions and impairment (losses) of $0.3 million and $0.9 million in continuing operations,
respectively. These charges are presented in the  Gains on dispositions and impairment (losses),
net  line item in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.

Other operating income, net, was $0.9 million and $0.2 million for the three months ended
January 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in other operating income, net, was
primarily due to a gain related to the sale of undeveloped cemetery land in the first quarter of
2006.

On May 31, 2005, we changed our method of accounting for preneed selling costs incurred
related to the acquisition of new prearranged funeral and cemetery service and merchandise sales.
We applied this change in accounting principle effective November 1, 2004. We changed our
accounting for preneed selling costs to expense such costs as incurred. As of November 1, 2004, we
recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $254.2 million ($153.2 million
after tax, or $1.40 per diluted share), which represents the cumulative balance of deferred preneed
selling costs in the deferred charges line on the condensed consolidated balance sheet at the time
of the change. For additional information, see Note 3(a) to the condensed consolidated financial
statements included herein.

The effective tax rate for our continuing operations for the three months ended January 31,
2006 was 36.8 percent compared to 34.2 percent for the same period in 2005. The change was
primarily due to the greater impact of the dividend exclusion on a reduced level of book income in
2005. The
dividend exclusion relates to dividends received for investments in certain trusts for which we
recognize earnings for tax purposes as earned by the trust.

As of January 31, 2006, our outstanding debt totaled $409.1 million. Of the total debt
outstanding as of January 31, 2006, approximately 49 percent was subject to fixed rates averaging
7.7 percent, and 51 percent was subject to short-term variable rates averaging approximately 6.0
percent. The average fixed rate includes the 1.50 percent additional interest we are required to
pay until the registration statement related to our 6.25 percent senior notes is filed and declared
effective by the SEC. On November 19, 2004, we completed the refinancing of our senior secured
credit facility and recorded a charge for early extinguishment of debt of $2.7 million ($1.7
million after tax, or $.02 per share) to write off fees associated with the previous credit
facility as of January 31, 2005.

Preneed Sales into and Deliveries out of the Backlog 

Preneed funeral sales increased 8.7 percent during the first quarter of 2006 compared to the
corresponding period in 2005.

44

Table of Contents   

The revenues from our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and service sales are
deferred into our backlog and are not included in our operating results presented above. We added
$40.5 million in preneed sales to our funeral and cemetery merchandise and services backlog
(including $17.3 million related to insurance-funded preneed funeral contracts) during the three
months ended January 31, 2006 to be recognized in the future (net of cancellations) as these
prepaid products and services are delivered, compared to sales of $38.2 million (including $16.3
million related to insurance-funded preneed funeral contracts) for the corresponding period in
2005. Revenues recognized on deliveries out of our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and
services backlog, including accumulated trust earnings related to these preneed deliveries,
amounted to $37.2 million for the three months ended January 31, 2006, compared to $36.1 million
for the corresponding period in 2005, resulting in net additions to the backlog of $3.3 million and
$2.1 million for the three months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flow 

Our operations provided cash of $27.3 million for the three months ended January 31, 2006,
compared to using cash of $1.9 million for the corresponding period in 2005. The increase is
primarily due to cash inflows of $11.0 million for trust withdrawals associated with the deferred
revenue project in the first quarter of 2006, the timing of interest payments and timing of
customer collections. Prior to the debt refinancing that occurred in February 2005, we made
interest payments in January and July of each year which correspond to our first and third fiscal
quarters. After the February 2005 debt refinancing, we make interest payments in February and
August of each year which correspond to our second and fourth fiscal quarters. The timing of
interest payments accounted for approximately $14 million of the increase in operating cash flow.
Additionally, operating cash in the first quarter of 2006 was partially impacted by an increase in
customer collections in the quarter following the delay in collections processing during the fourth
quarter of 2005 due to Hurricane Katrina. These increases in cash flow were partially offset by
$2.1 million of cash outflows in excess of insurance proceeds received related to Hurricane
Katrina. The timing of receipt of insurance proceeds is not in line with the timing of cash
spending related to Hurricane Katrina.

Our investing activities resulted in a net cash inflow of $0.3 million for the three months
ended January 31, 2006, compared to a net cash outflow of $1.0 million for the comparable period in
2005. In the first quarter of 2006, there was a net cash inflow of $4.5 million for insurance
proceeds related to hurricane damaged properties. Net asset sale proceeds were less than $0.1
million for the three months ended January 31, 2006 compared to $5.4 million for the same period in
2005. For the three months ended January 31, 2006, capital expenditures amounted to $4.3 million,
which included $4.3 million for maintenance capital expenditures compared to capital expenditures
of $6.5 million in the same period in 2005, which included $3.2 million for maintenance capital
expenditures and $3.3 million related to a building we purchased which was previously leased.

Our financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of $3.5 million for the three months
ended January 31, 2006, compared to $6.5 million for the comparable period in 2005. The change was
due primarily to debt repayments of $0.9 million in the three months ended January 31, 2006
compared to net debt repayments of $14.3 million in the comparable period of 2005. Stock option
exercises in the first quarter of 2005 resulting in issuances of common stock amounted to $10.4
million. There were no stock option exercises in the first quarter of 2006.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 

As of January 31, 2006, our outstanding debt balance was $409.1 million. The following table
details our known future cash payments (in millions) related to various contractual obligations as
of January 31, 2006.

(2)  
       
     Includes contractual interest payments for our revolving credit facility, Term Loan
B, senior notes and third-party debt. The interest on the revolving credit facility and Term
Loan B was calculated based on interest rates in effect as of January 31, 2006. 

(3)  
       
     Our noncancellable operating leases are primarily for land and buildings and expire
over the next one to 13 years, except for six leases that expire between 2032 and 2039. Our
future minimum lease payments as of January 31, 2006 are $3.6 million, $3.8 million, $3.1
million, $2.7 million, $2.2 million, and $18.5 million for the years ending October 31, 2006,
2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and later years, respectively.

     We have entered into non-competition agreements with prior owners and key employees
of acquired subsidiaries that expire through 2012. This category also includes separation pay
related to former executive officers. 

In connection with the issuance of the 6.25 percent senior notes, we entered into a
registration rights agreement that requires that a registration statement be filed and declared
effective by the SEC, and that an exchange offer be conducted providing for the exchange of the
unregistered notes for similar registered notes, all within specified times. So far, we have been
unable to cause the required registration statement to become effective and therefore are required
to pay additional interest to the note holders until the default is cured. Additional interest
began to accrue on June 12, 2005 at a rate of 0.50 percent per annum on the principal amount of the
notes for a period of 90 days. The additional interest increases 0.50 percent for each 90-day
period thereafter so long as the default exists, up to a maximum increase of 1.50 percent per
annum. The additional interest is payable at the regular interest payment dates. The additional
interest increased to 1.00 percent on September 11, 2005 and increased to 1.50 percent on December
11, 2005. Total additional interest incurred as of January 31, 2006 was $1.2 million.

As of January 31, 2006, our outstanding debt balance was $409.1 million, consisting of $207.5
million in Term Loan B, $200.0 million of 6.25 percent senior notes, and $1.6 million of other
debt. There were no amounts drawn on the revolving credit facility. The following table reflects
future scheduled principal payments and maturities of our long-term debt (in millions) as of
January 31, 2006.

We are required to maintain a bond of $41.1 million to guarantee our obligations relating to
funds we withdrew in fiscal year 2001 from our preneed funeral trusts in Florida. We substituted a
bond to guarantee performance under certain preneed funeral contracts and agreed to maintain unused
credit facilities in an amount that will equal or exceed the bond amount. We believe that cash
flow from operations will be sufficient to cover our estimated cost of providing the prearranged
services and products in the future. During the first quarter of 2006, we posted an $11.0 million
letter of credit in order to secure this bond. In addition, we have $12.9 million of other
outstanding letters of credit posted during the normal course of business.

As of January 31, 2006, there were no amounts drawn on our $125.0 million revolving credit
facility. As of January 31, 2006, our availability under the revolving credit facility, after
giving consideration to the aforementioned letters of credit and remaining bond obligation, was
$71.1 million.

On March 28, 2005, we announced a new $30.0 million stock repurchase program. Repurchases
under the new program are limited to our Class A common stock and will be made in the open market
or in privately negotiated transactions at such times and in such amounts as management deems
appropriate, depending on market conditions
and other factors. Since the inception of this program through January 31, 2006, we have
repurchased and retired 1,200,000 shares of our Class A common stock at an average price of $6.64
per share.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Our off-balance sheet arrangements as of January 31, 2006 consist of the following items:

(1) 
       
     the $41.1 million bond we are required to maintain to guarantee our obligations
relating to funds we withdrew in fiscal year 2001 from our preneed funeral trusts in
Florida, which is discussed above and in Note 21 to the consolidated financial
statements in our 2005 Form 10-K; and 

(2) 
       
     the insurance-funded preneed funeral contracts, which will be funded by life
insurance or annuity contracts issued by third-party insurers, are not reflected in our
consolidated balance sheets, and are discussed in Note 3(i) to the consolidated
financial statements in our 2005 Form 10-K. 

Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges 

Our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was as follows:

(1)  
       
     Pretax earnings for the three months ended January 31, 2006 include $2.6 million in
net hurricane related charges, $0.3 million of gains on dispositions and impairment (losses),
net and $0.2 million in separation charges. 

(2)  
       
     Pretax earnings for fiscal year 2005 include a charge of $9.4 million for expenses
related to Hurricane Katrina, a charge of $1.5 million for separation charges related to the
July 2005 restructuring of our divisions, $1.3 million of gains on dispositions and impairment
(losses), net and $32.8 million for the loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the
2005 debt refinancings. 

(3)  
       
     Pretax earnings for fiscal year 2004 includes separation charges of $3.4
million for costs related to workforce reductions and separation pay to a former executive
officer and ($0.2) million in gains on dispositions and impairment (losses), net. 

(4)  
       
     Pretax earnings for fiscal year 2003 include a charge of $11.3 million for the loss
on early extinguishment of debt in connection with redemption of the ROARS, a noncash charge
of $10.2 million for long-lived asset impairment and a charge of $2.5 million for separation
payments to former executive officers. 

(5)  
       
     Pretax earnings for fiscal year 2002 include a noncash charge of $18.5 million in
connection with the write-down of assets held for sale. 

(6)  
       
     Excludes the cumulative effect of change in accounting principles. 

(7)  
       
     Pretax earnings for fiscal year 2001 include a noncash charge of $269.2 million in
connection with the write-down of assets held for sale and other charges and a $9.1 million
charge for the loss on early extinguishment of debt. As a result of these charges, our
earnings for fiscal year 2001 were insufficient to cover our fixed charges, and an additional
$229.9 million in pretax earnings would have been required to eliminate the coverage
deficiency. 

For purposes of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings consist of pretax
earnings plus fixed charges (excluding interest capitalized during the period). Fixed charges
consist of interest expense, capitalized interest, amortization of debt expense and discount or
premium relating to any indebtedness and the portion of rental expense that management believes to
be representative of the interest component of rental expense.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is presented in Item 7A in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005, filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on February 17, 2006. The following disclosure discusses only those instances in which the
market risk has changed by more than 10 percent from the annual disclosure.

The market risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the
potential change arising from increases or decreases in the prices of marketable equity securities
and interest rates as discussed below. Generally, our market risk sensitive instruments and
positions are characterized as  other than trading.  Our exposure to market risk as discussed
below includes  forward-looking statements  and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair
value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in equity markets
or interest rates. Our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that
may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur. Actual gains
and losses, fluctuations in equity markets, interest rates and the timing of transactions may
differ from those estimated.

Interest 

We have entered into various fixed-rate and variable-rate debt obligations, which are detailed
in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2005 Form 10-K and in the
 Liquidity and Capital Resources  section of our  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations  included herein.

Our variable-rate debt consists of our Term Loan B and revolving credit facility. As of
January 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005, the carrying value of our Term Loan B was $209.7 million and
$210.2 million, respectively, compared to a fair value of $211.9 million and $213.1 million,
respectively. As of January 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005, there were no amounts drawn on the
revolving credit facility. As of January 31, 2006, each approximate 10 percent, or 70 basis-point,
change in the average interest rate applicable to this debt would result in a change of
approximately $1.0 million in our pretax earnings. As of October 31, 2005, each approximate 10
percent, or 65 basis-point, change in the average interest rate applicable to this debt would
result in a change of approximately $1.1 million in our pretax earnings. Fair value was determined
using quoted market prices, where applicable, or future cash flows discounted at market rates for
similar types of borrowing arrangements.

We monitor our mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt obligations in light of changing market
conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by, for example, refinancing balances
outstanding under our variable-rate revolving credit facility with fixed-rate debt or by entering
into interest rate swaps.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s ( SEC ) rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management,
including its Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

The Company s management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, as of January 31, 2006 of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as
such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon, and as of the date of
this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective because of the material weaknesses discussed below. Notwithstanding the material
weaknesses discussed below, the Company s management has concluded that the consolidated financial
statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present in all material respects
the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

48

Table of Contents   

A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that
results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. We identified the following material
weaknesses in our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as
of January 31, 2006:

1. 
       
     The Company did not maintain effective controls over revenue recognition related to
preneed cemetery merchandise and services contracts. Specifically, the Company did not maintain effective
controls over the reconciliation of recorded revenues to revenues based on physical delivery
of preneed cemetery merchandise to ensure completeness and accuracy of recorded preneed
cemetery merchandise revenue and deferred preneed cemetery revenue. This control deficiency
resulted in the restatement of the Company s consolidated financial statements for all annual
and interim periods beginning with fiscal year 2001, the period in which the Company adopted
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ( SAB 101 )  Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements ,
through fiscal year 2004 and the first three quarters of fiscal year 2005. Prior to the
adoption of SAB 101, the Company recognized preneed cemetery merchandise revenues at the time
a contract was entered into with a customer. This control deficiency could result in the
misstatement of cemetery merchandise revenues and of deferred preneed cemetery revenues that
would result in a material misstatement to annual or interim financial statements that would
not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, management determined that this control deficiency
represents a material weakness. 

2. 
       
     The Company did not maintain effective controls over recognition of realized trust
earnings on preneed cemetery and funeral contracts. Specifically, the Company did not
maintain effective controls to recognize realized net trust earnings upon the delivery of
the related preneed cemetery and funeral merchandise and performance of preneed funeral
services to ensure accuracy of recorded realized trust earnings and deferred trust earnings.
This control deficiency resulted in the restatement of the Company s consolidated financial
statements for all annual and interim periods from fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2004
and the first three quarters of fiscal year 2005. This control deficiency could result in
the misstatement of cemetery and funeral revenues and of the deferred revenue associated
with preneed cemetery and preneed funeral contracts sold on a preneed basis that would
result in a material misstatement to annual or interim financial statements that would not
be prevented or detected. Accordingly management determined that this control deficiency
represents a material weakness. 

As a result of the material weaknesses described above, the Company has concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of January 31, 2006.

Plan for Remediation 

Management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee, has been addressing the material
weaknesses described above in our internal control over financial reporting and its impact over
disclosure controls and procedures and is committed to effectively remediating these deficiencies
as expeditiously as possible. We have devoted significant time and resources to the remediation
efforts having completed a detailed review and assessment of nearly 700,000 contracts. Also, we are
in the process of enhancing our automated delivery systems over cemetery merchandise and are
establishing a team to design and implement an improved system for tracking and reporting trust
earnings. Further, the Company is undertaking steps to improve its employee training programs at
both cemetery and funeral locations which will include reiteration to the appropriate personnel of
the importance of performing their responsibilities in accordance with Company policies and
procedures.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during
the quarter ended January 31, 2006 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

For a discussion of our current litigation, see Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial
statements included herein.

In addition to the matters in Note 8, we and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to a
number of other legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. While the
outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not expect these
matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

We carry insurance with coverages and coverage limits that we believe to be adequate.
Although there can be no assurance that such insurance is sufficient to protect us against all
contingencies, management believes that our insurance protection is reasonable in view of the
nature and scope of our operations.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the 2005
Form 10-K.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

We have a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to invest up to $30.0 million
in the repurchase of our common stock. As of January 31, 2006, we had approximately $22.0 million
remaining available under the plan. The table below provides information about purchases made by or
on behalf of us, or of any  affiliated purchaser  as defined in SEC rules, of our equity securities
registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, for each month during the first quarter of
fiscal year 2006, in the format required by SEC rules. As indicated by the table, there were no
such repurchases during the first quarter of fiscal year 2006.

     On March 28, 2005, we announced a new stock repurchase program, authorizing the
investment of up to $30.0 million in the repurchase of our common stock. Repurchases under the
new program will be limited to our Class A common stock, and will be made in the open market
or in privately negotiated transactions at such times and in such amounts as management deems
appropriate, depending upon market conditions and other factors

Table of Contents   

(a) The Company has an Employment Agreement with each of its executive officers that specifies the
basis on which an annual bonus will be paid (the  Employment Agreements ). The Employment
Agreements provide that for fiscal year 2005, no bonus would be earned unless the Company achieved a threshold earnings per
share level. Although the Company s earnings per share for fiscal year 2005 did not reach the
threshold level, the Compensation Committee of the Company s
Board of Directors determined on
December 21, 2005 to award each executive officer named in the Summary Compensation Table in the
Company s 2006 proxy statement a bonus of $75,000 to be paid one-half in cash and one-half in
Company common stock. Other executive officers of the Company were also awarded bonuses of $25,000
or $75,000. The bonuses were awarded in recognition of the extraordinary efforts of the executive
officers in leading the Company through the effects of Hurricane Katrina and after considering each
officer s individual performance.
