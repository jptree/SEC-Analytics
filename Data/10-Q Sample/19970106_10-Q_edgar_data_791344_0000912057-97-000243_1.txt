ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND       
          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company was incorporated on April 3, 1986, as a limited purpose financing
corporation to facilitate the issuance and sale of mortgage-collateralized
bonds. The operations of the Company have been confined to this limited purpose.

Because of the limited purpose and operations of the Company, it does not have
and is not expected to have any significant assets, other than assets which may
be acquired and immediately pledged to secure a specific series of bonds issued
by the Company, if any, intangible capitalized costs and deferred registration
costs.

During the year ended March 31, 1996, the Company entered into several contracts
to provide for the rating, securitization and placement of an aggregate of
$132,000,000 in mortgage-backed securities. The contracts call for base fees
earned upon achievement of milestones and commissions at issuances which are
expected to occur at various dates over the next three years. No revenues have
yet been earned on these contracts and as of September 30, 1996, the Company has
retained $140,000 in customer deposits in connection therewith. 

Costs and expenses consisted primarily of contract expenses (commissions,
consulting and legal fees) and General and Administrative costs.

The Company has little need for liquidity as it is customary for the Company to
receive advances in connection with its contracts in order to cover contract
costs. However, the Company's major stockholder has provided the Company with
funding in the past, on an as-needed basis and has committed to support the
Company for at least a year. The Company has no commitments for capital
expenditures and no material resources.

The Company has open shelf registration statements on file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission under which the Company or trusts created by the Company
may issue mortgage-collateralized bonds in an aggregate principal amount of up
to $1.1 billion on an expedited basis. The Company actively pursues
opportunities which will allow it to utilize its unused shelf balance and which
are within the confines of the Company's limited purpose.
