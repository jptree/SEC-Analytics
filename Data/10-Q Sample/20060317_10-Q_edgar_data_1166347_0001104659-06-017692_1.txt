   NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   (Unaudited)   

The following notes should be read in conjunction with the notes to the
financial statements for the year ended July 31, 2005 as filed in the Company s
Form 10-K.  

NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION   

Dakota Growers Pasta
Company, Inc. ( Dakota Growers  or  the Company ) is a North Dakota corporation
that operates a milling and pasta manufacturing facility in Carrington, North
Dakota. In addition, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Primo Piatto, Inc. ( Primo
Piatto ), a Minnesota corporation, operates a pasta manufacturing facility in
New Hope, Minnesota.  

NOTE 2   FINANCIAL STATEMENT
PRESENTATION   

The unaudited
consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared pursuant
to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for
quarterly reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and
footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America for complete financial statements. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals)
considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating
results for the three and six month periods ended January 31, 2006 are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended
July 31, 2006. The unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this
Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and footnotes included in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended
July 31, 2005. The information contained in the balance sheet as of July 31,
2005 was derived from the Company s audited annual report for fiscal year 2005.
Reclassifications have been made to facilitate comparability with current
presentation. Such reclassifications have no effect on the net results of
operations.  

The financial information
presented herein includes the consolidated balance sheets and results of
operations of  the
Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Primo Piatto, Inc., and DNA Dreamfields
Company, LLC ( DNA Dreamfields ), which the Company began to consolidate in
fiscal year 2005. All material inter-company accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE 3   NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS   

The
FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R),  Share-Based Payment  in December 2004. SFAS No.
123(R) is a revision of SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock Based Compensation 
and is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2005. SFAS No. 123(R) requires the cost of share-based
payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be
measured based on grant-date fair values. That cost is recognized over the
period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for
the award, usually the vesting period. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) in
the quarter ended October 31, 2005. The adoption of this statement did not have
a material impact on the Company s financial statements. However, future
employee stock option grants may have a material impact on the Company s
financial statements as a result of SFAS No. 123(R).  

7  

The
FASB issued SFAS No. 151,  Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB 43, Chapter 4 
in November 2004. SFAS No. 151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,  Inventory 
Pricing,  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility
expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) so as to
require such costs to be treated as current period charges. Further, this
statement requires that the allocation of fixed overhead costs to inventoriable
production costs be based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities.  The provisions of this Statement are effective for inventory
costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company
adopted SFAS No. 151 in the quarter ended October 31, 2005. The adoption of
this statement did not have a material impact on the Company s financial
statements. However, future changes in the Company s production or logistics
could have a material impact on the Company s financial statements as a result
of SFAS No. 151.  

NOTE 4  
INVENTORIES   

Inventories are valued at lower of cost or market. Inventories as of January
31, 2006 include raw materials and packaging of $7,979,000 and finished goods
of $16,034,000. Inventories at July 31, 2005 include raw materials and
packaging of $7,262,000 and finished goods of $20,840,000.  

NOTE 5   LOAN AGREEMENTS   

The
Company has a $25.0 million revolving credit facility with CoBank which matures
on May 31, 2006. Balances outstanding under this revolving line of credit
arrangement totaled $7.5 million as of January 31, 2006, and $10.0 million as
of July 31, 2005. The Company had $17.5 million available for borrowings under this
line of credit as of January 31, 2006.  

The
Company also has a term loan facility with CoBank under which the Company may
borrow an aggregate principal amount of up to $19.0 million through May 1,
2006. Balances outstanding under the term loan were $17.0 million and $9.1
million as of January 31, 2006 and July 31, 2005, respectively. The Company had
$2.0 million available for borrowings under the CoBank term loan facility as of
January 31, 2006.  

The
Company s various debt agreements with CoBank and certain institutional note
holders obligate the Company to maintain or achieve certain amounts of equity
and certain financial ratios and impose certain restrictions on the Company.
The Company was in compliance with these financial covenants as of January 31,
2006.  

NOTE 6   EARNINGS PER
SHARE   

Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing net earnings
on common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted EPS includes the effect of all potentially dilutive
securities, such as stock options and convertible preferred stock.  

Dilutive
securities, consisting of stock options and convertible preferred stock,
included in the calculation of diluted weighted average common shares totaled 401,000
and 360,000 for the three and six month periods ended January 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. As there is currently no established public trading market for
the Company s common stock, the Company has assumed the proceeds from the
exercise of stock options would reduce debt and, thus, interest expense.  

8  

NOTE 7   DNA
DREAMFIELDS COMPANY, LLC   

Effective
May 1, 2005, the Company s ownership in DNA Dreamfields increased to
46.7%. In conjunction with the Company s
increase in ownership in DNA Dreamfields and changes in the DNA
Dreamfields operating agreement and other contractual arrangements, the Company determined that DNA
Dreamfields was a variable interest entity under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R),
 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,  and that the Company was the
primary beneficiary. Therefore, effective May 1, 2005, the Company began
to include DNA Dreamfields in its consolidated financial statements. The
results for the three and six month periods ended January 31, 2006 are
presented to include the results of operations of DNA Dreamfields in the
consolidated income statements.  

The Company entered into a  2005 Line of
Credit Loan Agreement  with DNA Dreamfields in the fourth quarter of fiscal
year 2005. Under that Agreement, the Company will loan up to $5,000,000 to
DNA Dreamfields, with DNA Dreamfields able to repay and reborrow amounts under
the Line of Credit Loan Agreement from time to time. The Line of Credit
Loan Agreement matures on May 31, 2010. The balance outstanding related
to advances to DNA Dreamfields under the Line of Credit Loan Agreement totaled
$1,840,000 and $465,000 as of January 31, 2006 and July 31, 2005, respectively.
These inter-company amounts have been eliminated in the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements.  

NOTE 8   DIVIDENDS   

On
December 15, 2005, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the payment of a
4 cents per share dividend on its Series D Delivery Preferred Stock and a
non-periodic dividend payment of 4 cents per share on its common stock, payable
on January 10, 2006 to shareholders of record as of December 19, 2005.  

NOTE 9   STOCK OPTIONS   

On December 22,
2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors granted incentive
stock options to purchase 141,256 shares of the Company s common stock at a per
share exercise price of $4.00. The vesting of these options is subject to
certain qualifications, including but not limited to, the continued employment
of the optionee with the Company. Subject to the foregoing qualifications and
certain other qualifications, f  ifty percent of these
options vest on December 22, 2006, twenty-five percent vest on December 22,
2007, and twenty-five percent vest on December 22, 2008.  

NOTE 10   CONTINUED DUMPING AND SUBSIDY OFFSET ACT OF 2000   

U.S.
Customs and Border Protection ( Customs ) has distributed antidumping and
countervailing duties assessed on certain pasta imported from Italy and Turkey
to affected domestic producers pursuant to the Continued Dumping and Subsidy
Offset Act of 2000 (the  Offset Act ), which was enacted in October 2000. The
Company received payments in the amount of $1,103,000 and $425,000 in December
2005 and 2004, respectively, under the Offset Act. These amounts have been
classified as other income. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the
potential amount, if any, that it may receive under the Offset Act in future
periods as any such amount will be based upon future events over which the
Company has little or no control, including, but not limited to, the amount of
expenditures by domestic pasta producers and the amount of antidumping and
countervailing duties collected by Customs.  

9  

NOTE 11   COMMITMENTS   

The Company forward contracts for a certain portion of its future durum
wheat requirements. The Company had outstanding commitments for grain purchases
totaling $12,819,000 as of January 31, 2006, related to forward purchase
contracts. These contracts are set price contracts to deliver grain to the
Company s mill, and are not derivative in nature as they have no net settlement
provision and are not transferable.  

The Company had commitments to purchase pasta equipment totaling
$126,000 as of January 31, 2006. These amounts are expected to be paid within
one year.  

10  

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

This
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations (MD A) should be read in conjunction with the MD A included
in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2005.  

Forward-Looking
Statements   

The
following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking
statements include, among others, those statements including the words  expect ,
 anticipate ,  believe ,  may  and similar expressions. Such statements are
based on assumptions by the Company s management as of the date of this
Quarterly Report, and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those
discussed in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2005 under  Risk
Factors,  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
anticipated. The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on such
forward-looking statements. The Company will not update any forward-looking
statements in this Quarterly Report to reflect future events or developments.  

Summary   

Dakota Growers is the third largest pasta
manufacturer in North America. The Company has two production plants, located
in Carrington, North Dakota and New Hope, Minnesota, and generates a majority
of its revenues from manufacturing pasta for the retail store brand and
foodservice markets, although we serve and continually look for opportunities
in the entire dry pasta industry. The Company s cost of goods sold consists
mainly of raw materials (primarily durum wheat), packaging, and manufacturing
and distribution costs. The Company competes through low cost production, high
product quality, flexibility and customer service.  

Net
income for the quarter ended January 31, 2006 totaled $617,000 compared to net income
of $764,000 for the quarter ended January 31, 2005. Net income for the six
months ended January 31, 2006 totaled $1,016,000 versus $579,000 for the six
months ended January 31, 2005.  The Company paid dividends of $451,000
($0.04 per share) on its Series D Delivery Preferred Stock and $527,000 ($0.04
per share) on its common stock during the second quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Net earnings per basic common share, after the
effect of dividends on preferred stock, were $0.01 per share for the quarter
ended January 31, 2006 compared to $0.06 per share for the quarter ended January
31, 2005. Net earnings per basic common share were $0.04 per share for the six
months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005. 

The
Company s net revenues increased 4.4% for the quarter ended January 31, 2006
when compared to the same period of last year, primarily due to higher pasta
per unit selling prices. Net revenues for the six months ended January 31, 2006
were up 13.0% compared to the same period of last year, with the increase
resulting mostly from increased pasta sales volumes in the first quarter of
fiscal year 2006 when compared to the same quarter of last year. Benefits
derived from increased sales and lower durum costs were partially offset by
continued high transportation costs. Freight cost increases during fiscal year
2006 have been driven by a combination of higher diesel fuel prices and reduced
rail and truck availability. The effectiveness of the Company s rail programs
was diminished in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 as lower finished goods
inventory levels limited the Company s ability to utilize rail programs to
forward warehouses. The Company does not expect significant improvements in
freight costs for the remainder of fiscal year 2006. Sales price increases which
became effective starting in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 are
expected to partially mitigate the impact of these higher costs.  

The
Company undertook a $15 million capital project at its New Hope, Minnesota
facility to better balance its pasta production capabilities and improve
operating costs. A main component of this project was the installation of a
new, state-of-the-art short goods production line. The new short goods line,
which became operational during the Company s second quarter of fiscal 2006,
increased the New Hope plant s capacity by 35% to approximately 230 million
pounds annually. However, higher conversion costs per unit at the New Hope
facility during the installation and start-up of the new production line
negatively impacted the Company s results for the first and second quarters of
fiscal year 2006. The Company also recorded a  $598,000 loss on disposal
during the six months ended January 31, 2006 related to the retirement of
certain equipment in conjunction with the capital project at the New Hope
facility.

Critical
Accounting Policies   

The
accompanying discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial
condition are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management
to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and
on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the
circumstances. However, future events are subject to change and the best
estimates and judgments may require adjustment. For a complete description of
the Company s significant accounting policies, please see Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Form 10-K for the year
ended July 31, 2005. Our critical accounting policies are those that have
meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results, and
that require significant management judgment and estimates. These policies
include our accounting for (a) allowance for doubtful accounts, (b) inventory
valuation, (c) asset impairment, and (d) income taxes.  

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   

We
evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination
of factors. In cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a
specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us, we record
a specific allowance against amounts due to us, and thereby reduce the net
recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected.
For all other customers, we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on
the length of time the receivables are past due and our historical experience.
If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates, additional allowances
may be required in the future that could have an adverse impact on our future
operating results.  

Inventory
Valuation   

Inventories are stated at
the lower of cost or market, determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis,
using product specific standard costs. The Company analyzes variances between
actual manufacturing costs incurred and amounts absorbed at inventory standard
costs. Inventory valuations are adjusted for these variances as applicable. The
Company regularly evaluates its inventories and recognizes inventory allowances
for discontinued and slow-moving inventories based upon these evaluations.  

Asset
Impairment   

We
are required to evaluate our long-lived assets, including goodwill, for
impairment and write down the value of any assets if they are determined to be
impaired. Evaluating the impairment of long-lived assets involves management
judgment in estimating the future cash flows and fair values related to these
assets. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators
exist and that the value of certain long-lived assets is impaired.  

Income
Taxes   

In
determining income (loss) for financial statement purposes, management must
make certain estimates and judgments in calculating tax liabilities and in
determining the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets. Deferred tax
assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of
available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. Management
believes it is likely that the deferred tax assets as of January 31, 2006 will
be realized through the generation of future taxable income and tax planning
strategies.  

12  

Basis of Presentation   

Effective
May 1, 2005, the Company began to include DNA Dreamfields in its
consolidated financial statements.  The results for the three and six
months ended January 31, 2006 are presented to include the results of
operations of DNA Dreamfields in the consolidated income statement. See Note 7
of the consolidated financial statements for additional information.  

Results
of Operations   

Comparison
of the Three Months Ended January 31, 2006 and 2005   

Net Revenues.     Net
revenues totaled $42.5 million for the three months ended January 31, 2006, an
increase of $1.8 million, or 4.4%, compared to $40.7 million for the three
months ended January 31, 2005. Overall, pasta per unit selling prices increased
5.4% while sales volumes declined by 0.3%. Retail revenues increased $0.1
million, or 0.6%, due to an 8.5 % increase in average selling prices offset by
a 7.3% volume decline. Foodservice revenues increased $0.4 million, or 3.4%,
due to a 2.0% increase in average selling prices and a 1.4% increase in sales
volumes. Ingredient revenues increased $1.4 million, or 26.8%, due to a 14.5%
volume gain and a 10.8% increase in average selling prices.  

The Company markets
semolina production in excess of its own requirements as well as durum wheat
flour, other flour blends and by-products of the durum milling process.
Revenues from mill product sales totaled $2.9 million for the three months
ended January 31, 2006, a decrease of $0.1 million when compared to the same
period of the prior year.  

Cost of Goods Sold.     Cost of goods sold increased $2.3
million, or 6.5%, to $38.1 million for the three months ended January 31, 2006,
compared to $35.8 million for the three months ended January 31, 2005. Gross profit
as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 10.3% for the three months ended January
31, 2006 from 12.1% for the three months ended January 31, 2005, primarily due
to the negative impacts of   higher freight
costs and higher per unit conversion costs for the quarter ended January 31,
2006. These factors were partially offset by   lower durum
costs  .  

Marketing, General, and Administrative ( MG A ) Expenses.     MG A
expenses increased 3.8% to $4.3 million for the three months ended January 31,
2006, compared to $4.1 million for the three months ended January 31, 2005. MG A
expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 10.0% for the three
months ended January 31, 2006, from 10.1% for the comparable quarter of the
prior year.  

Interest and Other Income.     Interest
and other income totaled $1.0 million for the three months ended January 31,
2006 compared to $0.4 million for the three months ended January 31, 2005. U.S.
Customs and Border Protection ( Customs ) has distributed antidumping and
countervailing duties assessed on certain pasta imported from Italy and Turkey
to affected domestic producers pursuant to the Continued Dumping and Subsidy
Offset Act of 2000 (the  Offset Act ), which was enacted in October 2000. The
Company received payments in the amount of $1.1 million and $0.4 million in
December 2005 and 2004, respectively, under the Offset Act. These amounts have
been classified as other income. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the
potential amount, if any, that it may receive under the Offset Act in future
periods as any such amount will be based upon future events over which the
Company has little or no control, including, but not limited to, the amount of
expenditures by domestic pasta producers and the amount of antidumping and
countervailing duties collected by Customs.  

Interest Expense.     Interest expense for the three months
ended January 31, 2006 totaled $0.7 million, up $0.1 million from $0.6 million
for the corresponding period of the prior year.  

Noncontrolling Interests.     Noncontrolling
interests reflect the portion of the DNA Dreamfields Company, LLC net loss
allocable to other members of DNA Dreamfields and totaled $0.5 million and $0.6
million for the three months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  

Income Taxes.     Income tax expense for the three
months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 totaled $0.4 million and $0.5 million,
respectively, and reflects an effective corporate income tax rate of
approximately 39%.  

13  

Net Income.     Net income for the three months ended January 31, 2006 totaled $0.6
million compared to net income of $0.8 million for the three months ended
January 31, 2005. Net earnings available to common shareholders for the three
months ended January 31, 2006 totaled $0.2 million after reducing net income
for dividends declared on Series D Delivery Preferred Stock.  

Comparison
of the Six Months Ended January 31, 2006 and 2005   

Net Revenues.     Net
revenues totaled $86.6 million for the six months ended January 31, 2006, an
increase of $10.0 million, or 13.0%, compared to $76.6 million for the six
months ended January 31, 2005. Total pasta sales volumes increased 10.7% with
sales in each of the retail, foodservice and ingredient markets realizing
volume gains. Ingredient sales volumes had the highest percentage increase at
25.9%, while foodservice sales volumes increased 7.6%, and retail sales volumes
increased 6.9%. Overall, pasta per unit selling prices increased 2.9% with
retail selling prices up 5.4%, foodservice selling prices up 1.1% and
ingredient selling prices up 5.0%.  

The Company markets
semolina production in excess of its own requirements as well as durum wheat
flour, other flour blends and by-products of the durum milling process.
Revenues from mill product sales totaled $5.4 million and $5.3 million for the six
months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  

Cost of Goods Sold.     Cost of goods sold increased $9.3
million, or 13.7%, to $77.0 million for the six months ended January 31, 2006,
compared to $67.7 million for the six months ended January 31, 2005. The
increase was primarily due to higher sales volumes. Gross profit as a
percentage of net revenues decreased to 11.1% for the six months ended January
31, 2006 compared to 11.6% for the six months ended January 31, 2005.   Higher
freight costs and higher per unit conversion costs negatively impacted gross
profit percentage for the six months ended January 31, 2006. These factors were
partially offset by   lower durum costs  .  

Marketing, General, and Administrative ( MG A ) Expenses.     MG A
expenses decreased $1.7 million, or 17.0%, to $8.1 million for the six months
ended January 31, 2006, compared to $9.8 million for the six months ended January
31, 2005. The decrease was primarily due to lower consumer advertising costs
associated with Dreamfields TM  pasta products. MG A expenses as a
percentage of net revenues decreased to 9.4% for the six months ended January
31, 2006, from 12.8% for the comparable period of last year.  

Interest and Other Income.     Interest
and other income totaled $1.1 million for the six months ended January 31, 2006
compared to $0.4 million for the six months ended January 31, 2005.
Substantially all of the amounts relate to payments received by the Company in
December 2005 and 2004 under the Offset Act. The Company cannot reasonably
estimate the potential amount, if any, that it may receive under the Offset Act
in future periods as any such amount will be based upon future events over
which the Company has little or no control, including, but not limited to, the
amount of expenditures by domestic pasta producers and the amount of
antidumping and countervailing duties collected by Customs.  

(Loss) Gain on Disposition of Property, Equipment and Other Assets.     The Company
incurred a Loss on Disposition of $0.6 million during the six months ended January
31, 2006. Virtually all of this loss was related to the retirement of certain
equipment in conjunction with the capital project at the New Hope, Minnesota
facility.  

Interest Expense.     Interest expense for the six months
ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 totaled $1.2 million and $1.3 million,
respectively.  

Noncontrolling Interests.     Noncontrolling
interests reflect the portion of the DNA Dreamfields Company, LLC net loss
allocable to other members of DNA Dreamfields and totaled $0.9 million and $2.6
million for the six months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
$1.7 million decrease was due to a reduction in the net loss reported by DNA
Dreamfields for the six months ended January 31, 2006 when compared to last
year, partially offset by the Company s increased ownership in DNA Dreamfields.  

Income Taxes.     Income tax expense for the six
months ended January 31, 2006 totaled $0.6 million compared to $0.4 million for
the six months ended January 31, 2005, and reflects an effective corporate
income tax rate of approximately 39%.  

14  

Net Income.     Net income for the six months ended January 31, 2006 totaled $1.0
million, compared to $0.6 million for the six months ended January 31, 2005. Net
earnings available to common shareholders for the six months ended January 31,
2006 totaled $0.6 million after reducing net income for dividends declared on
preferred stock.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

The
Company s primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and
borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Working capital as of January 31,
2006 totaled $16.8 million compared to $20.2 million as of July 31, 2005.  

The Company has a $25.0 million revolving credit
facility with CoBank, which extends through May 31, 2006. The balance
outstanding on the line of credit was $7.5 million as of January 31, 2006,
leaving $17.5 million available for borrowings as of that date.  

The Company also has a term loan facility with
CoBank under which the Company may borrow an aggregate principal amount of up
to $19.0 million through May 1, 2006. The balance outstanding under the term
loan was $17.0 million as of January 31, 2006, leaving $2.0 million available
for borrowings under the CoBank term loan facility as of that date.  

The
Company s various debt agreements with CoBank and certain institutional
investors obligate the Company to maintain or achieve certain amounts of equity
and certain financial ratios and impose certain restrictions on the Company.
The Company was in compliance with these financial covenants as of January 31,
2006 and the date of this filing.  

Net
cash from operating activities totaled $9.0 million and $5.7 million for the
six months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Significant items
contributing to this increase were changes in inventories, accounts payable and
net income as adjusted for non-cash items. Inventories decreased $4.1 million for
the six months ended January 31, 2006. The decrease in inventories for the six
months ended January 31, 2006 related to the Company s utilization of
inventories built-up over the latter portion of fiscal year 2005 to compensate
for reduced pasta production volumes resulting from the production upgrade
project at the New Hope manufacturing facility.  

Net cash used for investing activities totaled $8.9
million and $4.4 million for the six months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
The majority of this increase related to capital expenditures for the New Hope upgrade
project. As of January 31, 2006, the Company had expended a majority of the
estimated $15 million total project cost. Due to current sales demand and
related production capabilities, the Company has delayed the installation of
certain pasta production equipment totaling approximately $4.0 million
associated with the New Hope project.  

Net
cash used for financing activities totaled $0.2 million and $2.0 million for
the six months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The $0.2 million
of net cash from financing activities for the six months ended January 31, 2006
included $7.9 million in borrowings under the CoBank secured term loan facility
to finance the New Hope production upgrade project. The Company also paid
dividends of $0.5 million ($0.04 per share) on its Series D Delivery Preferred
Stock and $0.5 million ($0.04 per share) on its common stock during the second
quarter of fiscal year 2006.  

The
Company entered into a  2005 Line of Credit Loan Agreement  with DNA
Dreamfields in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, under which the Company
will loan up to $5.0 million to DNA Dreamfields on a revolving basis through
May 31, 2010. The balance outstanding related to advances to DNA Dreamfields
under the Line of Credit Loan Agreement totaled $1.8 million and $0.5 million
as of January 31, 2006 and July 31, 2005, respectively.  

15  

The following table summarizes the Company s
contractual obligations as of January 31, 2006 (in thousands):  

The
Company forward contracts for a certain portion of its future durum wheat
requirements. At January 31, 2006, the Company had outstanding commitments for
grain purchases totaling $12.8 million related to forward purchase contracts.
These contracts are set price contracts to deliver grain to the Company s mill,
and are not derivative in nature as they have no net settlement provision and
are not transferable.  

Management
believes that net cash currently available and to be provided by operating
activities, along with amounts available under the Company s line of credit and
term loan facilities, will be sufficient to meet the Company s expected capital
and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Market risk is the
risk of loss to future earnings, to fair values or to future cash flows that
may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a
financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates,
commodity prices, exchange rates, equity prices and other market changes.
Market risk is attributed to all market-risk sensitive financial instruments,
including long-term debt.  

The Company forward contracts for a certain portion of its future durum
wheat requirements. These contracts are set price contracts to deliver grain to
the Company s mill, and are not derivative in nature as they have no net
settlement provision and are not transferable. The Company does not believe it
is subject to any material market risk exposure with respect to interest rates,
commodity prices, exchange rates, equity prices, or other market changes that
would require disclosure under this item.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

The
Company s Chief Executive Officer, Timothy J. Dodd, and Chief Financial Officer,
Edward O. Irion, have evaluated the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon the
review, they have concluded that these controls and procedures are effective.  

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting    

In
conjunction with the resignation of Thomas P. Friezen as the Company s Chief
Financial Officer and the appointment of Edward O. Irion to the position of Chief
Financial Officer on February 21, 2006, applicable internal controls over
financial reporting were reviewed and changed as necessary. Mr. Irion most
recently served as the Company s Vice President   Finance and Chief Accounting
Officer. There were no other changes in the Company s internal controls over financial
reporting during the Company s fiscal second quarter ended January 31, 2006   that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company s internal control over financial reporting.
