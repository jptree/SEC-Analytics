Independent Accountants' Report

The Board of Directors
Countrywide Financial Corporation:

We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying Management
Assertion, that Countrywide Financial Corporation and subsidiaries, including
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. ("CHL"), and
Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, L.P., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CHL,
(collectively, the "Company") complied with the minimum servicing standards set
forth in the Mortgage Bankers Association of America's Uniform Single
Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers (USAP) as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2005.  Management is responsible for the Company's compliance with
those minimum servicing standards.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management's assertion about the Company's compliance based on our
examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and,
accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's
compliance with the minimum servicing standards specified above and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We
believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance
with the minimum servicing standards.

In our opinion, management's assertion that Countrywide Financial Corporation
and subsidiaries, including its wholly-owned subsidiary, Countrywide Home Loans,
Inc. ("CHL"), and Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, L.P., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of CHL, complied with the aforementioned minimum servicing standards
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 is fairly stated, in all material

Report on Management's Assertion on Compliance
with the Specified Minimum Servicing Standards Set Forth in the
Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers

Report of Independent Accountants

Board of Directors
National City Mortgage Co.

We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying report
titled Report of Management, that National City Mortgage Co.(NCM) complied with
the minimum servicing standards identified in Exhibit A to the Report of
Management (the specific minimum servicing standards) as set forth in the
Mortgage Bankers Association of America's Uniform Single Attestation Program for
Mortgage Bankers during the year-ended December 31, 2005. Management is
responsible for NCM's compliance with the specified minimum servicing standards.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertions about
NCM's compliance based on our examination.

Our examination was made in accordance with attestation standards established by
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly,
included examining, on a test basis, evidence about NCM's compliance with the
specified minimum servicing standards and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a
legal determination on NCM's compliance with specified minimum servicing
standards.

In our opinion, management's assertion that NCM complied with the aforementioned
specified minimum servicing standards during the year ended December 31, 2005,
is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Exhibit A

Minimum Servicing Standards

Custodial Bank Accounts

Reconciliations shall be prepared on a monthly basis for all custodial bank
accounts and related bank clearing accounts. These reconciliations shall be
mathematically accurate, be prepared within forty-five (30) calendar days after
the cutoff date. The cutoff date is the date as of which a bank account is
reconciled every month. It may, or may not, coincide with a prescribed investor
reporting date but shall be consistent from period to period, be reviewed and
approved by someone other than the person who prepared the reconciliation and
document explanations for reconciling items. These reconciling items shall be
resolved within ninety (90) calendar days of their original identification.
Funds of the servicing entity shall be advanced in cases where there is an
overdraft in an investor's or a mortgagor's account. Each custodial account
shall be maintained at a federally insured depository institution in trust for
the applicable investor. Escrow funds held in trust for a mortgagor shall be
returned to the mortgagor within thirty (30) calendar days of payoff of the
mortgage loan.

Procedure:

The bank reconciliation processors have no reporting or remitting authority or
responsibility. They are responsible for reporting reconciling items greater
than 90 days to the supervisor. Because of this, the supervisor and manager
review all the clearing accounts, any account with reconciling items greater
than 90 days, and accounts with an overdrawn balance only.

All of the custodial accounts are reconciled each month, with any outstanding
items over 90 days reported to supervision for their review. They are reconciled
within 30 days.

After all accounts are reconciled,
* The bank recon log which records the all accounts and the date the
  reconciliation is completed is given to the Supervisor of the area.
* Any custodial account which has items 90 days outstanding is indicated in red
  on the log and that month's reconciliation is given with the log to the
  Supervisor.

The reconciliation log is given to the supervisor who verifies all accounts are
reconciled within the time frames. Each clearing account is reviewed by the
Supervisor for validity, verifying the reconciliation is complete and accurate,
using any system reports if they are applicable. The Supervisor signs off on the
bottom of each reconciliation and dates the document.

After all accounts are reviewed and any memos are prepared and signed off, all
of the reconciliations and the reconciliation log are then forwarded to the Vice
President of Investor Services for a second review and signoff.

All private pool investor (recon 660) and GSE principal and interest custodial
account reconciliations are reviewed and signed off on by the supervisor. Also,
the manager selects 10 accounts per month at random for review.

Mortgage Payments

Mortgage payments shall be deposited into the custodial bank accounts and
related bank clearing accounts within two (2) business days of receipt. Mortgage
payments made in accordance with

(page)

the mortgagor's loan documents shall be posted to the applicable mortgagor
records within two (2) business days of receipt. Mortgage payments shall be
allocated to principal, interest, insurance, taxes or other escrow items in
accordance with the mortgagor's loan documents. Mortgage payments identified as
loan payoffs shall be allocated in accordance with the mortgagor's loan
documents.

Procedure:

NCM receives mortgage payments from their customers through the following
channels: Lockbox, EFT, Over-the-Counter [OTC are payments made at a National
City Bank branch], In-House payments [payments received from other departments
or directly mailed to NCM], and Electronic Transmissions [payments received
electronically from vendors such as SpeedPay, CheckFree, Metavante, Princeton
eCom, On-Line Resources and Western Union Quick Collect]. All customer payments
made via Lockbox, EFT, Over-the-Counter, In-House and Electronic Transmissions
are ultimately transferred to the NCMC Collection Clearing Account (DDA #
2532529). The Collection Clearing account activity is balanced to Exact
transaction reports on a daily basis by Payment Services. These reports are
retrieved from a bank reporting service. The Collection Clearing account is also
balanced to the bank statement monthly by Investor Services, who has no payment
posting authority.

Each day, balancing processors ensure that the payments received from the
channels noted above are deposited into the related bank clearing accounts and
that the borrower's payment information has been updated to MSP [Fidelity].

All payments received by National City Mortgage are updated within two (2)
business days or less. Below is a description by payment channel.
* Lockbox has an SLA [Service Level Agreement] with NCM that 100% of matched
  payments will be processed same day. The remaining, exception payments will be
  processed 100% the next day.
* EFT payments are processed electronically on their scheduled date.
* OTC payments are transmitted directly to MSP daily by National City Bank.
* Electronic/Bill Payment Vendor payments are transmitted directly to MSP daily
  by the vendor.
* In-House payments are received from: (1) other departments, (2) unprocessed
  work from Lockbox; (3) Customer Service lobby; and (4) payments mailed
  directly to NCMC. In-House payments [exception payments] are keyed directly
  into the MSP system and are applied to the mortgagor records the day received
  by Payment Services. If all payments are not processed same day, they are
  processed the first thing the following morning. Payments are processed
  first-in-first-out.

Each payment processed into MSP [Fidelity] is automatically allocated by the MSP
system to principal, interest, taxes, insurance and service fees during MSP's
nightly processing. National City Mortgage Co. accepts payoffs by check or wire.
Payoff checks and wires received by 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through
Friday, will be processed the same day. Payoff checks must be mailed to: 3232
Newmark Dr., Miamisburg, Ohio 45342, Attn: Payoff Dept. All payoffs are date
stamped and posted to the servicing system (Fidelity) the same day received with
the exception of short payoffs. Deposit slips are prepared and batch reconciled
to the deposit. The deposit slips and corresponding checks are hand delivered to
Payment Services for a second reconciliation to prepare for delivery to the
bank. If payoff funds received are inadequate and sufficient funds are not in
the loans escrow/impound account, National City Mortgage Co. will contact the
sender of the funds to collect the shortage.

Disbursements

(page)

Disbursements made via wire transfer on behalf of a mortgagor or investor shall
be made only by authorized personnel. Disbursements made on behalf of a
mortgagor or investor shall be posted within two (2) business days to the
mortgagor's or investor's records maintained by the servicing entity. Tax and
insurance payments shall be made on or before the penalty or insurance policy
expiration dates, as indicated on tax bills and insurance premium notices,
respectively, provided that such support has been received by the servicing
entity at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to these dates. Any late payment
penalties paid in conjunction with the payment of any tax bill or insurance
premium notice shall be paid from the servicing entity's funds and not charged
to the mortgagor, unless the late payment was due to the mortgagor's error or
omission. Amounts remitted to investors per the servicer's investor reports
shall agree with cancelled checks, or other form of payment, or custodial bank
statements. Unissued checks shall be safeguarded so as to prevent unauthorized
access.

Procedure:

National City Mortgage Co has proper internal controls to provide reasonable
assurance that investor remittances and tax and insurance payments are properly
authorized at the correct amount. The servicing system tracks due dates to
ensure timely payment. All clearing and custodial accounts are reconciled
monthly to the servicing system. Only authorized personnel are allowed wire
transfer access and check printing access. Internal audits and utilization of
the servicing system prevents duplicate payments.

Each loan is audited to ensure that the appropriate insurance and tax
information has been populated for correct disbursement. Tax and Insurance
information is tracked on an automated "Insurance or Tax Workstation" and
disbursements are generated based on the appropriate expiration or due date.

Investor Accounting and Reporting

The servicing entity's investor reports shall agree with, or reconcile to,
investors' records on a monthly basis as to the total unpaid principal balance
and number of loans serviced by the servicing entity.

Procedure:

For the majority of loans, the investor sends a "turnaround" report which
compares the servicer trial balance records to the investor records. Other
investors notify the Investor Services department of differences.

Mortgagor Loan Accounting

The servicing entity's mortgage loan records shall agree with, or reconcile to,
the records of mortgagors with respect to the unpaid principal balance on a
monthly basis. Adjustments on adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) loans shall be
computed based on the related mortgage note and any ARM rider. Escrow accounts
shall be analyzed, in accordance with the mortgagor's loan documents, on at
least an annual basis. Interest on escrow accounts shall be paid, or credited,
to mortgagors in accordance with the applicable state laws.

Procedure:

Once a loan boards the Fidelity servicing system, it is reviewed for accuracy.
The Fidelity system tracks each loan until termination. Sufficient funds are
deposited to the escrow account to cover insurance premiums, (including hazard,
flood, PMI and MIP), taxes, and special assessments.

(page)

ARM adjustments are calculated on an automated "ARM workstation" and are based
on the appropriate index as obtained in the Wall Street Journal or other
financial publication as needed. A letter is sent according to RESPA
requirements, advising the borrower of the new rate.

Each escrowed loan is boarded on the Fidelity servicing system with a coupon
month that indicates when the loan is due for escrow analysis. Loans are
reviewed each month based upon the coupon month and the mass escrow analysis is
performed. Quality audit reports are ordered monthly on the entire portfolio to
ensure that the loans are in the appropriate coupon month and that each loan has
been analyzed in the past twelve months or remains within RESPA compliance.

The accrual of interest on escrow is tracked on the Fidelity servicing system on
the loan level. Monthly reports, ordered by the Escrow Analysis Supervisor,
release the funds to be deposited into the escrow accounts. Quarterly, the
Escrow Analysis Supervisor reviews the state regulations for changes. Quality
audit reports are ordered monthly on the loans in states requiring interest on
escrow to ensure that the loans are properly coded for interest on escrow.

Delinquencies

Records documenting collection efforts shall be maintained during the period a
loan is in default and shall be updated at least monthly. Such records shall
describe the entity's activities in monitoring delinquent loans including, for
example, phone calls, letters and mortgage payment repayment plans in cases
where the delinquency is deemed temporary (i.e., illness or unemployment).

Procedure:

National City Mortgage Co.'s collection strategy is to make early contact with
delinquent mortgagors to improve the likelihood that defaults and poor pay
habits can be cured. This strategy employs a series of calls, letters, and
property inspections to gather information regarding the reasons for default,
the mortgagors' ability to pay, their intentions to retain the property and the
condition of the property.

Delinquency trends, by product, are analyzed throughout the month to provide
effective call campaign penetration strategies. Risk Profiler and Early
Indicator scoring are utilized to prioritize calling campaigns. High risk and
special product loans are managed in a Special Servicing Team. This team
consists of counselors who demonstrate strong technical and product knowledge,
excellent listening skills, and possess a thorough understanding of loss
mitigation.

The use of Early Resolution allows counselors to work all stages of delinquency.
Loans thirty or more days past due are worked through Early Resolution starting
the first day of the month. Less than thirty-day delinquent loans are worked in
FIS through the sixteenth of the month. All delinquent loans are processed
through Early Resolution by the seventeenth day of the month.

The scripting and prompting tools within Early Resolution guide the counselor to
obtain the necessary mortgagor information required to evaluate a hierarchy of
solutions. Approximately three hundred management controls and embedded complex
calculations within Early Resolution lead the counselor through the appropriate
qualification/pre-qualification or loss mitigation resolution. The available
Loss Mitigation options are:
* Partial Claim/Claim Advance

* Modification

* Short Sale

(page)

* Deed-in-lieu of foreclosure

Workouts are encouraged if the end result is to improve the likelihood that the
mortgagor can retain his/her home through reduced payments or that losses can be
reduced through an assisted short sale of the property. In the interest of
minimizing investor losses, collection activity continues during the loss
mitigation review process. If the mortgagor's financial situation does not
support a workout or if the mortgagor is unwilling to work with National City
Mortgage Co., the loan is breached and moved timely through the foreclosure
process. Loss Mitigation will continue to be offered to the borrower throughout
the foreclosure process.

Insurance Policies

A fidelity bond and errors and omissions policy shall be in effect on the
servicing entity throughout the reporting period in the amount of coverage
represented to investors in management's assertion.

Procedure:

National City Mortgage Co is required to carry adequate coverage on National
City Mortgage Co's loans in the event that National City Mortgage Co made an
error. The policy is reviewed annually to ensure proper coverage.

Exhibit A

Minimum Servicing Standards

Custodial Bank Accounts

Reconciliations shall be prepared on a monthly basis for all custodial bank
accounts and related bank clearing accounts. These reconciliations shall be
mathematically accurate, be prepared within forty-five (30) calendar days after
the cutoff date. The cutoff date is the date as of which a bank account is
reconciled every month. It may, or may not, coincide with a prescribed investor
reporting date but shall be consistent from period to period, be reviewed and
approved by someone other than the person who prepared the reconciliation and
document explanations for reconciling items. These reconciling items shall be
resolved within ninety (90) calendar days of their original identification.
Funds of the servicing entity shall be advanced in cases where there is an
overdraft in an investor's or a mortgagor's account. Each custodial account
shall be maintained at a federally insured depository institution in trust for
the applicable investor. Escrow funds held in trust for a mortgagor shall be
returned to the mortgagor within thirty (30) calendar days of payoff of the
mortgage loan.

Procedure:

The bank reconciliation processors have no reporting or remitting authority or
responsibility. They are responsible for reporting reconciling items greater
than 90 days to the supervisor. Because of this, the supervisor and manager
review all the clearing accounts, any account with reconciling items greater
than 90 days, and accounts with an overdrawn balance only.

All of the custodial accounts are reconciled each month, with any outstanding
items over 90 days reported to supervision for their review. They are reconciled
within 30 days.

After all accounts are reconciled,
* The bank recon log which records the all accounts and the date the
  reconciliation is completed is given to the Supervisor of the area.
* Any custodial account which has items 90 days outstanding is indicated in red
  on the log and that month's reconciliation is given with the log to the
  Supervisor.

The reconciliation log is given to the supervisor who verifies all accounts are
reconciled within the time frames. Each clearing account is reviewed by the
Supervisor for validity, verifying the reconciliation is complete and accurate,
using any system reports if they are applicable. The Supervisor signs off on the
bottom of each reconciliation and dates the document.

After all accounts are reviewed and any memos are prepared and signed off, all
of the reconciliations and the reconciliation log are then forwarded to the Vice
President of Investor Services for a second review and signoff.

All private pool investor (recon 660) and GSE principal and interest custodial
account reconciliations are reviewed and signed off on by the supervisor. Also,
the manager selects 10 accounts per month at random for review.

Mortgage Payments

Mortgage payments shall be deposited into the custodial bank accounts and
related bank clearing accounts within two (2) business days of receipt. Mortgage
payments made in accordance with

(PAGE)

the mortgagor's loan documents shall be posted to the applicable mortgagor
records within two (2) business days of receipt. Mortgage payments shall be
allocated to principal, interest, insurance, taxes or other escrow items in
accordance with the mortgagor's loan documents. Mortgage payments identified as
loan payoffs shall be allocated in accordance with the mortgagor's loan
documents.

Procedure:

NCM receives mortgage payments from their customers through the following
channels: Lockbox, EFT, Over-the-Counter [OTC are payments made at a National
City Bank branch], In-House payments [payments received from other departments
or directly mailed to NCM], and Electronic Transmissions [payments received
electronically from vendors such as SpeedPay, CheckFree, Metavante, Princeton
eCom, On-Line Resources and Western Union Quick Collect]. All customer payments
made via Lockbox, EFT, Over-the-Counter, In-House and Electronic Transmissions
are ultimately transferred to the NCMC Collection Clearing Account (DDA #
2532529). The Collection Clearing account activity is balanced to Exact
transaction reports on a daily basis by Payment Services. These reports are
retrieved from a bank reporting service. The Collection Clearing account is also
balanced to the bank statement monthly by Investor Services, who has no payment
posting authority.

Each day, balancing processors ensure that the payments received from the
channels noted above are deposited into the related bank clearing accounts and
that the borrower's payment information has been updated to MSP [Fidelity].

All payments received by National City Mortgage are updated within two (2)
business days or less. Below is a description by payment channel.
* Lockbox has an SLA [Service Level Agreement] with NCM that 100% of matched
  payments will be processed same day. The remaining, exception payments will be
  processed 100% the next day.
* EFT payments are processed electronically on their scheduled date.
* OTC payments are transmitted directly to MSP daily by National City Bank.
* Electronic/Bill Payment Vendor payments are transmitted directly to MSP daily
  by the vendor.
* In-House payments are received from: (1) other departments, (2) unprocessed
  work from Lockbox; (3) Customer Service lobby; and (4) payments mailed
  directly to NCMC. In-House payments [exception payments] are keyed directly
  into the MSP system and are applied to the mortgagor records the day received
  by Payment Services. If all payments are not processed same day, they are
  processed the first thing the following morning. Payments are processed
  first-in-first-out.

Each payment processed into MSP [Fidelity] is automatically allocated by the MSP
system to principal, interest, taxes, insurance and service fees during MSP's
nightly processing. National City Mortgage Co. accepts payoffs by check or wire.
Payoff checks and wires received by 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through
Friday, will be processed the same day. Payoff checks must be mailed to: 3232
Newmark Dr., Miamisburg, Ohio 45342, Attn: Payoff Dept. All payoffs are date
stamped and posted to the servicing system (Fidelity) the same day received with
the exception of short payoffs. Deposit slips are prepared and batch reconciled
to the deposit. The deposit slips and corresponding checks are hand delivered to
Payment Services for a second reconciliation to prepare for delivery to the
bank. If payoff funds received are inadequate and sufficient funds are not in
the loans escrow/impound account, National City Mortgage Co. will contact the
sender of the funds to collect the shortage.

Disbursements

(PAGE)

Disbursements made via wire transfer on behalf of a mortgagor or investor shall
be made only by authorized personnel. Disbursements made on behalf of a
mortgagor or investor shall be posted within two (2) business days to the
mortgagor's or investor's records maintained by the servicing entity. Tax and
insurance payments shall be made on or before the penalty or insurance policy
expiration dates, as indicated on tax bills and insurance premium notices,
respectively, provided that such support has been received by the servicing
entity at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to these dates. Any late payment
penalties paid in conjunction with the payment of any tax bill or insurance
premium notice shall be paid from the servicing entity's funds and not charged
to the mortgagor, unless the late payment was due to the mortgagor's error or
omission. Amounts remitted to investors per the servicer's investor reports
shall agree with cancelled checks, or other form of payment, or custodial bank
statements. Unissued checks shall be safeguarded so as to prevent unauthorized
access.

Procedure:

National City Mortgage Co has proper internal controls to provide reasonable
assurance that investor remittances and tax and insurance payments are properly
authorized at the correct amount. The servicing system tracks due dates to
ensure timely payment. All clearing and custodial accounts are reconciled
monthly to the servicing system. Only authorized personnel are allowed wire
transfer access and check printing access. Internal audits and utilization of
the servicing system prevents duplicate payments.

Each loan is audited to ensure that the appropriate insurance and tax
information has been populated for correct disbursement. Tax and Insurance
information is tracked on an automated "Insurance or Tax Workstation" and
disbursements are generated based on the appropriate expiration or due date.

Investor Accounting and Reporting

The servicing entity's investor reports shall agree with, or reconcile to,
investors' records on a monthly basis as to the total unpaid principal balance
and number of loans serviced by the servicing entity.

Procedure:

For the majority of loans, the investor sends a "turnaround" report which
compares the servicer trial balance records to the investor records. Other
investors notify the Investor Services department of differences.

Mortgagor Loan Accounting

The servicing entity's mortgage loan records shall agree with, or reconcile to,
the records of mortgagors with respect to the unpaid principal balance on a
monthly basis. Adjustments on adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) loans shall be
computed based on the related mortgage note and any ARM rider. Escrow accounts
shall be analyzed, in accordance with the mortgagor's loan documents, on at
least an annual basis. Interest on escrow accounts shall be paid, or credited,
to mortgagors in accordance with the applicable state laws.

Procedure:

Once a loan boards the Fidelity servicing system, it is reviewed for accuracy.
The Fidelity system tracks each loan until termination. Sufficient funds are
deposited to the escrow account to cover insurance premiums, (including hazard,
flood, PMI and MIP), taxes, and special assessments.

(PAGE)

ARM adjustments are calculated on an automated "ARM workstation" and are based
on the appropriate index as obtained in the Wall Street Journal or other
financial publication as needed. A letter is sent according to RESPA
requirements, advising the borrower of the new rate.

Each escrowed loan is boarded on the Fidelity servicing system with a coupon
month that indicates when the loan is due for escrow analysis. Loans are
reviewed each month based upon the coupon month and the mass escrow analysis is
performed. Quality audit reports are ordered monthly on the entire portfolio to
ensure that the loans are in the appropriate coupon month and that each loan has
been analyzed in the past twelve months or remains within RESPA compliance.

The accrual of interest on escrow is tracked on the Fidelity servicing system on
the loan level. Monthly reports, ordered by the Escrow Analysis Supervisor,
release the funds to be deposited into the escrow accounts. Quarterly, the
Escrow Analysis Supervisor reviews the state regulations for changes. Quality
audit reports are ordered monthly on the loans in states requiring interest on
escrow to ensure that the loans are properly coded for interest on escrow.

Delinquencies

Records documenting collection efforts shall be maintained during the period a
loan is in default and shall be updated at least monthly. Such records shall
describe the entity's activities in monitoring delinquent loans including, for
example, phone calls, letters and mortgage payment repayment plans in cases
where the delinquency is deemed temporary (i.e., illness or unemployment).

Procedure:

National City Mortgage Co.'s collection strategy is to make early contact with
delinquent mortgagors to improve the likelihood that defaults and poor pay
habits can be cured. This strategy employs a series of calls, letters, and
property inspections to gather information regarding the reasons for default,
the mortgagors' ability to pay, their intentions to retain the property and the
condition of the property.

Delinquency trends, by product, are analyzed throughout the month to provide
effective call campaign penetration strategies. Risk Profiler and Early
Indicator scoring are utilized to prioritize calling campaigns. High risk and
special product loans are managed in a Special Servicing Team. This team
consists of counselors who demonstrate strong technical and product knowledge,
excellent listening skills, and possess a thorough understanding of loss
mitigation.

The use of Early Resolution allows counselors to work all stages of delinquency.
Loans thirty or more days past due are worked through Early Resolution starting
the first day of the month. Less than thirty-day delinquent loans are worked in
FIS through the sixteenth of the month. All delinquent loans are processed
through Early Resolution by the seventeenth day of the month.

The scripting and prompting tools within Early Resolution guide the counselor to
obtain the necessary mortgagor information required to evaluate a hierarchy of
solutions. Approximately three hundred management controls and embedded complex
calculations within Early Resolution lead the counselor through the appropriate
qualification/pre-qualification or loss mitigation resolution. The available
Loss Mitigation options are:
* Partial Claim/Claim Advance

* Modification

* Short Sale

(PAGE)

* Deed-in-lieu of foreclosure

Workouts are encouraged if the end result is to improve the likelihood that the
mortgagor can retain his/her home through reduced payments or that losses can be
reduced through an assisted short sale of the property. In the interest of
minimizing investor losses, collection activity continues during the loss
mitigation review process. If the mortgagor's financial situation does not
support a workout or if the mortgagor is unwilling to work with National City
Mortgage Co., the loan is breached and moved timely through the foreclosure
process. Loss Mitigation will continue to be offered to the borrower throughout
the foreclosure process.

Insurance Policies

A fidelity bond and errors and omissions policy shall be in effect on the
servicing entity throughout the reporting period in the amount of coverage
represented to investors in management's assertion.

Procedure:

National City Mortgage Co is required to carry adequate coverage on National
City Mortgage Co's loans in the event that National City Mortgage Co made an
error. The policy is reviewed annually to ensure proper coverage.
