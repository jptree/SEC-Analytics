CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

January 31, 2006   

1.                   The Company  

Organization.    First
Investors Financial Services Group, Inc. (First Investors) was established to
serve as a holding company for First Investors Financial Services, Inc. (FIFS)
and FIFS s wholly-owned subsidiaries, First Investors Insurance Company (FIIC),
First Investors Auto Receivables Corporation (FIARC), F.I.R.C., Inc. (FIRC),
First Investors Servicing Corporation (FISC), formerly known as Auto Lenders
Acceptance Corporation (ALAC), FIFS Acquisition Funding Corp. LLC, Farragut
Financial Corporation, and First Investors Auto Funding Corporation. First
Investors, together with its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, is
hereinafter referred to as the Company.  

FIFS
began operations in May 1989 and is principally involved in the business of
originating and holding for investment retail installment contracts and
promissory notes secured by new and used automobiles originated by factory
authorized franchised dealers or directly through consumers. As of January 31,
2006, approximately 32% and 15% of receivables held for investment had been
originated in Texas and Georgia, respectively. The Company currently operates
in 28 states.  

FIIC
was organized under the captive insurance company laws of the state of Vermont
for the purpose of reinsuring certain credit enhancement insurance policies
that have been written by unrelated third party insurance companies.  

On
October 2, 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of FISC and the
operations of FISC are included in the consolidated results of the Company
since the date of acquisition. Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, FISC
performed servicing and collection activities on a portfolio of receivables
originated for investment as well as on a portfolio of receivables originated
and sold pursuant to two asset securitizations. As a result of the acquisition,
the Company increased the total dollar value on its balance sheet of
receivables, acquired an interest in certain trust certificates related to the
asset securitizations and acquired certain servicing rights along with
furniture, fixtures, equipment and technology to perform the servicing and collection
functions for the portfolio of receivables under management.  

On
August 8, 2000, the Company entered into a partnership agreement (Partnership)
whereby a subsidiary of the Company was the general partner owning 70% of the
partnership interests and First Union Investors, Inc. served as the limited
partner and owned 30% of the partnership interests. On September 19, 2003,
First Investors Financial Services, Inc. purchased the limited partnership
interests previously held by First Union Investors, Inc. The Partnership
consists primarily of a portfolio of loans previously owned or securitized by
FISC and certain other financial assets including charged-off accounts owned by
FISC.  

On
December 24, 2002, the Company purchased 40% of common stock and an investment
in the junior mezzanine debt of First Auto Receivables Corporation (FARC). FARC
purchased an approximately $197.5 million portfolio of installment loan
receivables from a subsidiary of Union Acceptance Corporation. FISC performs
ongoing servicing and collection activities on the portfolio.  

On
March 19, 2003, FISC entered into a servicing agreement with an unrelated third
party to service an approximately $300 million portfolio of installment loan
receivables purchased from a subsidiary of Union Acceptance Corporation.  

In
total, at January 31, 2006, FISC performs servicing and collection functions on
a managed receivables portfolio of approximately $460 million.

2.                     Interim Financial Information  

Basis of Presentation  .
The consolidated condensed financial statements include the accounts of First
Investors and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Investments in
which the Company exercises significant influence, but which it does not
control (generally a 20% to 50% ownership interest), are accounted for under
the equity method of accounting, except for variable interest entities for
which the Company is considered the primary beneficiary under Financial
Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Interpretation No. 46,   Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51  , as
amended in December 2003 by Interpretation 46R. As of January 31, 2006, the
Company does not have any variable interest entities under which FIN 46 as
amended by Interpretation 46R would apply. 

The results for the
interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations
that may be expected for the fiscal year. In the opinion of management, the
information furnished reflects all adjustments which are of a normal recurring
nature and are necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s financial
position as of January 31, 2006, and the results of its operations for the
three and nine months ended January 31, 2005 and 2006, and its cash flows for
the nine months ended January 31, 2005 and 2006.  

The consolidated
condensed financial statements for the interim periods have been prepared
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in
financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or
omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes
that the disclosures are adequate to make the information not misleading. These
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated condensed financial statements included in the Company s 2005
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed July 29, 2005.  

Receivables Held for Investment  . Receivables
Held for Investment represents the aggregate outstanding balance of installment
sales contracts and promissory notes originated by the Company through its
automobile dealer relationships or directly with consumers. The Company accrues
interest income monthly using the effective interest method. When a receivable
becomes 90 days past due, the income accrual is suspended until the payments
become current. When a loan is charged off or the collateral is repossessed,
the remaining income accrual is written off. 

Other Income  .
Other Income consists of income received from servicing activities, other
finance charges and fees, income from investments, reinvestment revenue, income
earned from the sale of GAP insurance and extended service contracts, and
unrealized gain or loss on interest rate derivative positions. Servicing
revenue is accrued as services are rendered. Late fees and other loan-related
fees are recognized when received. Income from investments and reinvestment
revenue are accrued based on the respective interest rate of such investment.
Income from the sale of GAP insurance and extended service contracts is
recognized when sold as the Company has no further obligation after the sale.
Unrealized gain or loss on interest rate derivatives is recognized when
incurred. 

Allowance for Credit Losses  . The Company calculates the allowance for credit losses in accordance
with SFAS No. 5  , Accounting for Contingencies.   SFAS
No. 114,   Accounting By Creditors for Impairment of a Loan  
does not apply to loans currently held by the Company because they comprise a
large group of smaller balance homogenous loans that are evaluated collectively
for impairment. 

The
Company initiates efforts to make customer contact as early as when the
customer is one day past due and become more aggressive as the loan becomes
further past due. Management reviews past due loans and considers various
factors including payment history, job status and any events that may have
occurred that prevent the customer from making a payment. Through the
evaluation, if it is determined that the loan is uncollectible, the collateral
is typically repossessed. Generally this occurs at 60 to 90 days after the loan
becomes past due. Upon repossession, the uncollectible portion of the loan and
100% of accrued interest is written off. The fair   

8  

value of the collateral is
recorded as an Assets Held for Sale. Fair value is determined by estimating the
proceeds from the sale of the collateral, which primarily are comprised of
auction proceeds on the sale of the automobile less selling related expenses.
After collection of all proceeds, the Company records an adjustment, positive
or negative, based on the difference between the fair value estimate and the
proceeds received. In the event the collateral cannot be located or if the
customer refuses to pay and is not subject to bankruptcy court protection, the
Company will write off the entire balance of the loan once it reaches 180 days
past due. If the customer is subject to bankruptcy court protection, the loan
generally remains in bankruptcy status as long as payments are being received
from the trustee. If a payment is missed, the Company seeks to repossess the
collateral with approval of the court. If the customer is dismissed from
bankruptcy, the Company resumes collection efforts.  

The
Company applies a systematic methodology in order to determine the amount of
the allowance for credit losses. The specific methodology is a six-month
migration analysis whereby the Company compares the aging status of each loan
on a date which is six months prior to the reporting date, to the aging loan
status as of the reporting date. These factors are then applied to the aging
status of each loan at the reporting date in order to calculate the number of
loans that are expected to migrate to impaired status. The estimated number of
impairments is then multiplied by the estimated loss per loan, which is based
on historical information. Effective the quarter ended April 30, 2005, the
Company elected to increase its allowance for loan losses against loans that
were greater than 120 days past due and loans in which the collateral had been
assigned for repossession but had not yet been repossessed as of the reporting
date. The Company believes that this increase is warranted in light of the
change in federal bankruptcy laws enacted during the period and the recognition
that the migration trends of severely delinquent loans and loans subject to
bankruptcy are expected to become more protracted. Based on this, the Company
has assigned a specific allowance against these loans equal to the outstanding
balance of loans in these categories less the estimated recovery amount based
on current data regarding liquidation of the collateral and collection of any
additional payments. The Company utilized its most recent recovery rates in
order to assess fair value of these loans. For loans that are not classified
into these categories, the historical migration pattern is utilized in order to
establish the estimated impairment. The allowance for credit losses is based on
estimates and qualitative evaluations. Ultimate losses may vary from current
estimates. These estimates are reviewed periodically and as adjustments, either
positive or negative, become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the
period they become known.  

Stock-Based Compensation   . The Company has an
employee stock option plan and a non-employee director stock option plan, which
are described more fully in Note 9. The Company has adopted the disclosure
provisions of SFAS No. 148,   Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123  .
This pronouncement requires prominent disclosures in both annual and interim
financial statements regarding the method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results.
The Company accounts for stock compensation awards under the intrinsic value
method of Accounting Principles Board ( APB ) Opinion No. 25,   Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees   which requires
compensation cost to be recognized based on the excess, if any, between the
quoted market price of the stock at the date of grant and the amount the
grantee must pay to acquire the stock. All options awarded under the Company s
plan are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the
date of the grant.

The following table presents the Company s net income per share had the
Company adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock-based
compensation under SFAS No. 123,   Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation  , as amended by SFAS No. 148.  

Reclassifications  . Certain reclassifications have been made to the
fiscal 2005 amounts to conform with the fiscal 2006 presentation. 

3.                   Receivables Held for Investment  

The receivables generally have terms between 48 and 72 months and are
collateralized by the underlying vehicles. Net receivable balances consisted of
the following at April 30, 2005 and January 31, 2006:  

(1)             Includes premium and discounts paid to dealer
plus deferred acquisition cost. 

Activity in the allowance for credit losses
for the periods ended January 31, 2005 and 2006 was as follows:  

4.                   Receivables Acquired
for Investment  

Receivables
Acquired for Investment comprise loans previously originated by Auto Lenders
Acceptance Corporation and another third party. Loans originated by Auto
Lenders Acceptance Corporation include a portfolio of warehouse loans and a
portfolio of loans that were previously securitized. The securitized loans were
subsequently redeemed and funded through one of the Company s credit
facilities. Receivables Acquired for Investment previously originated by Auto
Lenders Acceptance Corporation were purchased at a discount relating to credit
quality. As a result of the amortization of the outstanding principal balance
of the receivables portfolio, the majority of the remaining cash flows
projected constitute default collections from obligors. Given the nature  

10  

of the remaining cash flows of
individual loans, the Company determined that the timing of collections on
Receivables Acquired for Investment was much more unpredictable than
contractual cash flows from non-defaulted receivables. Therefore, under the
guidance provided by Practice Bulletin 6  , Amortization of
Discounts on Certain Acquired Loans  , Receivables Acquired for
Investment will be accounted for under the cost-recovery method beginning
September 30, 2003. Under the cost recovery method, cash proceeds from
collections are applied to first reduce the Company s basis in the assets. Cash
collected in excess of this cost basis is recognized as income when received.
Receivables Acquired for Investment previously originated by Auto Lenders Acceptance
Corporation were $607,894 and $294,504 as of April 30, 2005 and January 31,
2006, respectively.  

On
September 30, 2003 the Company purchased $9.4 million of defaulted auto loan
receivables from an unrelated third party. The remaining balances of these
loans of $33,329 and $0 are included in Receivables Acquired for Investment on
the balance sheet as of April 30, 2005 and January 31, 2006 respectively, and
are accounted for using the cost-recovery method. The Company may, from time to
time, consider similar acquisitions in the future.  

5.                   Debt  

The
Company finances its loan origination through two warehouse credit facilities.
The Company s credit facilities provide for one-year terms and have been
renewed annually. Management of the Company believes that the credit facilities
will continue to be renewed or extended or that it would be able to secure
alternate financing on satisfactory terms; however, there can be no assurance
that it will be able to do so. In January, 2002 the Company issued $159 million
in asset-backed notes ( Term Notes ) secured by discrete pools of receivables.
These notes were subsequently called and redeemed in March, 2005. In November,
2003, the Company issued $140 million in Term Notes secured by a discrete pool
of receivables. In May, 2005, the Company issued $175 million in Term Notes
secured by a discrete pool of receivables. In January, 2006, the Company issued
$189 million in Term Notes secured by a discrete pool of receivables.
Substantially all receivables retained by the Company are pledged as collateral
for the credit facilities and the Term Notes. The weighted average interest
rate for the Company s secured borrowings including the effect of program fees
and dealer fees was 3.5% and 4.4% for the periods ended January 31, 2005 and
2006, respectively.

FIRC   - In order to
obtain a lower cost of funding, the Company has agreed to maintain credit
enhancement insurance covering the receivables pledged as collateral under the
FIRC credit facility. The facility lenders are named as additional insureds
under these policies. The coverages are obtained on each receivable at the time
it is originated by the Company, and the applicable premiums are prepaid for
the life of the receivable. Each receivable is covered by three separate credit
insurance policies, consisting of basic default insurance under a standard auto
loan protection policy (known as  ALPI  insurance) together with certain
supplemental coverages relating to physical damage and other risks. Solely at
its expense, the Company carries these coverages and neither the vehicle
purchasers nor the dealers are charged for the coverages, nor are they usually
aware of their existence. The Company s ALPI insurance policy is written by
National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh ( National Union ), which
is a wholly-owned subsidiary of American International Group. 

The premiums that the Company paid during the three months and nine
months ended January 31, 2006 for its three credit enhancement insurance
coverages, of which the largest component is basic ALPI insurance, represented
approximately 2.1% of the principal amount of the receivables originated during
the periods. Aggregate premiums paid for ALPI coverage alone were $1,028,980
and $584,613 during the three months ended, and $2,645,416 and $3,156,179 for
nine months ended, January 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively, and accounted for
2.8% and 1.2% during the three months ended, and 2.6% and 1.6% for the nine
months ended, January 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively, of the principal amount
of the receivables originated during such respective periods.  

In April 1994, the Company organized First Investors Insurance Company
(the  Insurance Subsidiary ) under the captive insurance company laws of the
State of Vermont. The Insurance Subsidiary is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company and is a party to a reinsurance agreement whereby the Insurance
Subsidiary reinsures 100% of the risk under the Company s ALPI insurance
policy. At the time each receivable is insured by National Union, the risk is
automatically reinsured to its full extent and approximately 96% of the premium
paid by the Company to National Union with respect to such receivable is ceded
to the Insurance Subsidiary. When a loss covered by the ALPI policy occurs,
National Union pays it after the claim is processed, and National Union is then
reimbursed in full by the Insurance Subsidiary. In addition to the monthly
premiums and liquidity reserves of the Insurance Subsidiary, a trust account is
maintained by National Union to secure the Insurance Subsidiary s obligations
for losses it has reinsured.  

The result of the foregoing reinsurance structure is that National
Union, as the  fronting  insurer under the captive arrangement, is
unconditionally obligated to the Company s credit facility lenders for all losses
covered by the ALPI policy, and the Company, through its Insurance Subsidiary,
is obligated to indemnify National Union for all such losses. As of January 31,
2006, the Insurance Subsidiary had capital and surplus of $2,761,279 and
unencumbered cash reserves of $1,660,665 in addition to $3,393,022 in a trust
account.  

The ALPI coverage as well as the Insurance Subsidiary s liability under
the Reinsurance Agreement, remains in effect for each receivable that is
pledged as collateral under the warehouse credit facility. Once receivables are
transferred from FIRC to FIARC and financed under the commercial paper
facility, ALPI coverage and the Insurance Subsidiary s liability under the
Reinsurance Agreement is cancelled with respect to the transferred receivables.
Any unearned premium associated with the transferred receivables is returned to
the Company. The Company believes the losses its Insurance Subsidiary will be
required to indemnify will be less than the premiums ceded to it. However,
there can be no assurance that losses will not exceed the premiums ceded and
the capital and surplus of the Insurance Subsidiary.  

FIARC     Credit
Enhancement for the FIARC warehouse facility is provided to the commercial
paper investors by a cash reserve account equal to 1% of the receivables held
by FIARC and, additionally, a surety bond issued by MBIA. The Company is not a
guarantor of, or otherwise a party to, such commercial paper.

On December 4, 2003, the FIRC facility was renewed,
under similar terms and conditions, at the $50 million commitment level until
December 2, 2004, and was subsequently extended until February 14, 2007. On
June 15, 2004, the FIRC facility was increased to $65 million, and reverted
back to $50 million on September 13, 2004. As of April 30, 2005 and January 31,
2006, there was $43.6 million and $21.7, respectively, outstanding.  

On January 29, 2004, following a short-term
extension of the original maturity date, the FIARC facility was renewed, under
similar terms and conditions, to December 2, 2004, and was subsequently
extended until March 15, 2006. As of April 30, 2005 and January 31, 2006, there
was $127.9 and $0, respectively, outstanding.  

Management presently intends to seek further extensions to these
warehouse facilities prior to the current expiration dates. Management further
considers its relationship with its lenders to be satisfactory and has no
reason to believe that the FIRC and FIARC facilities will not be renewed at
each of their respective expiration dates.

respectively. The Class B Note does not bear interest but requires principal
reductions sufficient to reduce the balance of the Class B Note to 3.25% of the
outstanding balance of the underlying receivables pool. A surety bond issued by
MBIA Insurance Corporation provides credit enhancement for the Class A Notes.
In the event that certain asset quality covenants are not met, the reserve
account target level will increase to the greater of 2% of the initial pool
balance or 6% of the then current principal balance of the receivables pool. As
of January 31, 2006, there were no principal payments made on the 2006-A Term
Notes, and the outstanding balance is equal to the original issuance amount of
$189,060,000.  

Working Capital Facility  . The facility is provided to a special-purpose, wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company, First Investors Residual Funding LP. This facility
revolves monthly in accordance with a borrowing base consisting of the
overcollateralization amount and reserve account for each of the Company s
other credit facilities. The facility is secured solely by the residual cash
flow and cash reserve accounts related to the Company s warehouse credit
facilities and the existing and future term note facilities. The outstanding
borrowings under the facility bear interest at one-month LIBOR plus 2.25%. In
addition, a commitment fee of 1.5% is paid on the total amount of this
facility. On October 26, 2004, the Working Capital Facility was extended until
October 10, 2005, increasing the commitment amount from $9 million to $13.5
million. The interest rate remained at LIBOR plus 2.25% and the commitment fee
paid on the total available amount of the facility was maintained at 1.5%. On
August 15, 2005, the Working Capital Facility was extended until February 15,
2006, increasing the commitment amount to $23.5 million, and was subsequently
extended on February 15, 2006 until February 14, 2007. The interest rate
remained at LIBOR plus 2.25% and the commitment fee paid on the total available
amount of the facility was maintained at 1.5%. As of April 30, 2005 and January
31, 2006, there was $10,500,000 and $15,149,641, respectively, outstanding
under this facility. 

The
Company presently intends to seek a renewal of the working capital facility
from its lender prior to maturity. Should the facility not be renewed, the
outstanding balance of the receivables would be amortized in accordance with
the borrowing base. Management considers its relationship with its lenders to
be satisfactory and has no reason to believe that this credit facility will not
be renewed. If the facility is not renewed, however, or if material changes are
made to its terms and conditions, it could have a material adverse effect on
the Company.  

Related Party Loans.   On December 3, 2001 the Company entered into an agreement with one of
its shareholders who is a member of its Board of Directors under which the
Company may, from time to time, borrow up to $2.5 million. On December 6, 2004,
the original $2.5 million shareholder loan was replaced with a $2.5 million
loan containing identical terms and conditions between the Company and a
limited partnership that is affiliated with a current shareholder and member of
the Board of Directors  The proceeds of
the borrowings have been utilized to fund certain private and open market
purchases of the Company s common stock pursuant to a  

15  

Stock Repurchase Plan
authorized by the Board of Directors and for general corporate purposes.
Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a fixed rate of 10% per annum.
The facility is unsecured and expressly subordinated to the Company s senior
credit facilities. The facility matures on December 3, 2008 but may be repaid
at any time unless the Company is in default on one of its other credit
facilities. There was $2.5 million outstanding under this facility as of April
30, 2005 and January 31, 2006. The Company recorded interest expense of $0 and
$63,014 for the three months ended, and $0 and $189,041 for the nine months ended,
January 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively.  

Loan Covenants  . The
documentation governing these credit facilities and Term Notes contains
numerous covenants relating to the Company s business, the maintenance of
credit enhancement insurance covering the receivables (if applicable), the
observance of certain financial covenants, the avoidance of certain levels of
delinquency experience and other matters. The breach of these covenants, if not
cured within the time limits specified, could precipitate events of default
that might result in the acceleration of the FIRC credit facility, the Term
Notes and the working capital facility or the termination of the commercial
paper facilities. The Company was not in default with respect to any financial
and non-financial covenants governing these financing arrangements at January
31, 2006. 

Interest Rate Management  .
The Company s warehouse credit facilities and working capital facilities bear
interest at floating interest rates which are reset on a short-term basis while
the secured Term Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of interest. The Company s
receivables bear interest at fixed rates that do not generally vary with a
change in market interest rates. Since a primary contributor to the Company s
profitability is its ability to manage its net interest spread, the Company
seeks to maximize the net interest spread while minimizing exposure to changes
in interest rates. In connection with managing the net interest spread, the
Company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps or caps to minimize the
effects of market interest rate fluctuations on the net interest spread. To the
extent that the Company has outstanding floating rate borrowings or has elected
to convert a portion of its borrowings from fixed rates to floating rates, the
Company will be exposed to fluctuations in short-term interest rates. 

During the nine months ended January 31, 2006, as a
requirement of the FIARC commercial paper facility, the Company entered into
seven interest rate cap transactions, with a strike rate of 6%. The aggregate
initial notional amount of the caps was $131,710,159 which amortizes over six
years. The Company paid $449,746 in premium to purchase these caps.  On January 26, 2006, the Company terminated all
interest rate caps outstanding in exchange for proceeds of $275,000. The caps
were terminated following the repayment of all balances outstanding under the
FIARC facility prior to the issuance of the 2006-A Term Notes. As a result, a
realized loss of $174,746 was incurred relative to the aggregate market value
of the interest rate caps.  

During fiscal year 2005, as a requirement of
the FIARC commercial paper facility, the Company entered into nine interest
rate cap transactions, with strike rates between 5% and 6%. The aggregate
initial notional amount of the caps was $126,086,843 which amortized over six
years. The Company paid an aggregate of $1,213,097 in premiums to purchase
these caps. The interest rate caps were not designated as hedges, and
accordingly, changes in the fair value of the interest rate caps were recorded
as unrealized gains or losses and reflected in net income. On April 28, 2005,
the Company terminated all interest rate caps outstanding in exchange for
proceeds of $840,000. The caps were terminated following the repayment of all
balances outstanding under the FIARC facility prior to the issuance of the
2005-A term notes. As a result, a realized loss of $373,097 was incurred
relative to the aggregate market value of the interest rate caps.

6.     Earnings Per Share   

Earnings per share amounts are based on the weighted
average number of shares of common stock and potential dilutive common shares
outstanding during the period. The weighted average number of shares used to
compute basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months
ended January 31, 2005 and 2006, is as follows:  

For
the three and nine months ended January 31, 2005 and 2006, the Company had
468,000 and 63,500, respectively, of stock options and stock warrants which
were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share. These were
not included in the computation of earnings per share because to do so would
have been antidilutive for the period presented.  

7.                   Investment in First Auto Receivables Corporation  

On
December 24, 2002, the Company invested $475,061 for a 40% ownership interest
in First Auto Receivables Corporation ( FARC ) and $712,591 for junior
mezzanine investments of FARC. FARC purchased a $197.5 million automobile loan
portfolio from UAFC-2 Corporation, a subsidiary of Union Acceptance
Corporation, with proceeds from $186 million in senior bridge debt, $8.9
million of senior mezzanine debt, $1.8 million of junior mezzanine debt and
$1.2 million of equity. The bridge debt interest rate is LIBOR plus 1%, the
senior mezzanine interest rate is 22.5% and the junior mezzanine interest rate
is 25%.  

The
Company accounts for its ownership investment in FARC using the equity method
in accordance with APB Opinion 18. In addition to the equity and debt
investments, the Company performs loan servicing and collection activities on
the portfolio. The Company recognized servicing revenue of  $207,505 and $122,462 for the three months
ended, and $707,997 and $423,367 for the nine months ended, January 31, 2005
and 2006, respectively, interest income of $27,473 and $21,048 for the three
months ended, and $82,418 and $75,933 for the nine months ended, January 31,
2005 and 2006, respectively, and equity in earnings in FARC of $156,652 and
$95,839 for the three months ended, and $526,880 and $333,033 for the nine
months ended, January 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively. As of April 30, 2005 the
equity investment in FARC of $968,327 and junior mezzanine debt of $716,675 and
as of January 31, 2006, the equity investment in FARC of $832,695 and junior
mezzanine debt of $417,431 are included in Deferred Financing Costs and Other
Assets on the balance sheet.  

8.                 New Accounting
Pronouncements  

In
February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,  Accounting for Certain
Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and
140  ( SFAS 155 ). This statement amends SFAS No. 133,  Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  ( SFAS 133 ), and SFAS
No. 140,  Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishments of Liabilities  and resolves issues addressed in SFAS 133
Implementation Issue No. D1,  Application of Statement 133 to Beneficial
Interest in Securitized Financial Assets . This Statement: (a) permits
fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an
embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation;
(b) clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not
subject to the requirements of SFAS 133; (c) establishes a requirement to
evaluate beneficial interests in securitized financial assets to identify
interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial
instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation;
(d) clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of
subordination are not embedded derivatives; and, (e) eliminates  

17  

restrictions on a qualifying
special-purpose entity s ability to hold passive derivative financial
instruments that pertain to beneficial interests that are or contain a
derivative financial instrument. The standard also requires presentation within
the financial statements that identifies those hybrid financial instruments for
which the fair value election has been applied and information on the income
statement impact of the changes in fair value of those instruments. The Company
is required to apply SFAS 155 to all financial instruments acquired, issued or
subject to a remeasurement event beginning January 1, 2007 although early
adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year. The
provisions of SFAS 155 are not expected to have a financial statement impact
recorded at adoption; however, the standard could affect the future income
recognition for securitized financial assets because there may be more embedded
derivatives identified with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  

In
May 2005, SFAS No. 154,  Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,  was issued.
This statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and
requires retrospective application to prior periods  financial statements of
changes in accounting principle, unless this would be impracticable. This
statement also makes a distinction between  retrospective application  of an
accounting principle and the  restatement  of financial statements to reflect
the correction of an error. This statement is effective for accounting changes
and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005.
The Company does not expect the adoption of this interpretation to have a
material impact on its financial position, cash flows and results of
operations.  

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R),   Share-Based
Payment - a revision to SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation   ( SFAS
No. 123(R) ) that addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions
in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity
instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair
value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the
issuance of such equity instruments. SFAS No. 123(R) eliminates the ability to
account for share-based compensation transactions using APB Opinion No. 25,   Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees  , and generally
requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a
fair-value-based method.  

SFAS
No. 123(R) is effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year that begins
after June 15, 2005. SFAS 123(R) applies to all awards granted after the
required effective date and to such awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled
after that date. The cumulative effect of initially applying SFAS No. 123(R),
if any, is recognized as of the required effective date. As of the required
effective date, all public entities that used the fair-value-based method for
either recognition or disclosure under SFAS No. 123 will apply SFAS No. 123(R)
using a modified version of the prospective application. Under that transition
method, compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date
for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not
yet been rendered, based on the grant-date fair value of those awards
calculated under SFAS No. 123 for either recognition or pro forma disclosures.
For periods before the required effective date, those entities may elect to
apply a modified version of retrospective application under which financial
statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro
forma disclosures required for those periods by SFAS No. 123. The Company has
not yet completed its evaluation of the impact that SFAS No. 123(R) will have
on its financial position and results of operations.  

9.     Shareholders 
Equity   

Preferred Stock   . The
Company has authorized 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a $1.00 par
value. As of January 31, 2006, no shares have been issued.  

Employee      Stock Option Plan  . In June 1995, the Board of Directors
adopted the Company s 1995 Employee Stock Option Plan (the Plan). The Plan is
administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and
provides that options may be granted to officers and other key employees for
the purchase of up to 300,000 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment in
the event of certain changes in capitalization. On September 10, 2002, the
number of shares of common stock available for issuance was increased to
500,000. Options may be granted either as incentive stock options (which are
intended to qualify for certain favorable tax treatment) or as non-qualified
stock options. The Compensation Committee selects the persons to receive
options and determines the exercise price, the duration, any conditions on
exercise and other terms of the options. In the case of options intended to be
incentive stock options, the exercise price may not be less than 100% of the
fair market value per share of common stock on the date of grant. With respect
to non-qualified stock options, the exercise price may be  

18  

fixed
as low as 50% of the fair market value per share at the time of grant. In no
event may the duration of an option exceed 10 years and no option may be
granted after the expiration of 10 years from the adoption of the Plan. As of
April 30, 2005 and January 31, 2006, a total of 533,500 options had been
issued, with 360,500 and 294,500, respectively, options outstanding under the
plan. This plan expired on June 27, 2005.  

On
September 8, 2005, the shareholders approved the Company s 2005 Employee Stock
Option Plan (the 2005 Plan). The 2005 Plan is administered by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors and provides that options may be granted to
officers and other key employees for the purchase of up to 200,000 shares of
common stock, subject to adjustment in the event of certain changes in
capitalization. Options may be granted either as incentive stock options (which
are intended to qualify for certain favorable tax treatment) or as non-qualified
stock options. The Compensation Committee selects the persons to receive
options and determines the exercise price, the duration, any conditions on
exercise and other terms of the options. The exercise price may not be less
than 100% of the fair market value per share of common stock on the date of
grant, and in no event may the duration of an option exceed 10 years and no
option may be granted after the expiration of 10 years from the adoption of the
Plan. As of January 31, 2006, 102,500 options were issued and outstanding under
the 2005 Plan, leaving 97,500 options remaining and available for issuance.  

The
exercise price of the option is payable in cash upon exercise. At the
discretion of the Compensation Committee, options may be issued in tandem with
stock appreciation rights entitling the option holder to receive an amount in
cash or in shares of common stock, or a combination thereof, equal in value to
any increase since the date of grant in the fair market value of the common
stock covered by the option.  

Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan    - In
September 2002, the Non-Employee Stock Option Plan was established to further
align the interests of the Company s directors with the interests of the
shareholders, as well as attracting and retaining qualified directors. The
Board of Directors administers the plan and the options will not be qualified
as incentive stock options. A total of 500,000 shares of common stock are
available for issuance. Option grants will be both automatic and discretionary.
Automatic grants of 20,000 shares for each non-employee director, or 100,000
shares total, were approved in September 2002. Subsequent automatic grants of
an option to purchase 20,000 shares shall be made to each non-employee director
on July 15 th  each year, beginning July 15, 2003. The plan also gives
the Board of Directors discretionary authority to provide for additional option
grants if the Company s annual financial performance exceeds parameters
established by the Board. No discretionary grants have been awarded. As of
April 30, 2005 and January 31, 2006, a total of 390,000 and 490,000,
respectively, options had been issued, with 390,000 and 450,000, respectively,
options outstanding under the plan, leaving a remaining 110,000 and 10,000,
respectively, available for issuance. In addition to the options granted above,
there were an additional 20,000 options granted to a director in 1995, before
the adoption of the Non-Employee Stock Option Plan.  

10.               Subsequent Event   

For
the three months ended January 31, 2006, the Company incurred legal expenses of
$214 and accrued legal expenses of $30 and settlement costs of $450 in
connection with its defense and settlement of a class action lawsuit filed
against a wholly-owned subsidiary alleging violations of the Fair Credit
Reporting Act. The Company s decision to settle the lawsuit was prompted by the
trial court s granting the plaintiff s motion for summary judgment on January
20, 2006. The Company and its counsel believe that the court s ruling is
contrary to the statute and the facts in the case, and believe that an appeal
would be successful. However, given the trial court s ruling, the Company
concluded that settlement is preferable to continuing to incur the costs
associated with the appeal and defense of the lawsuit. The settlement is
subject to approval of the court, which is anticipated on March 15, 2006.

ITEM 2.      MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     

Critical Accounting Policies   

Financial Reporting Release No. 60, which was issued by the Securities
and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), requires all registrants to discuss critical
accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements.
Note 2 to the consolidated condensed financial statements includes a summary of
the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the
Company s consolidated condensed financial statements.  

The preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
The following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates, as
well as the accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the
consolidated condensed financial statements.  

Receivables Held for Investment  . Receivables
Held for Investment represents the aggregate outstanding balance of installment
sales contracts and promissory notes originated by the Company through its
automobile dealer relationships or directly with consumers, which includes the
amortization of premiums or discounts associated with the loan originations.
The Company accrues interest income monthly using the effective interest
method. When a receivable becomes 90 days past due, the income accrual is
suspended until the payments become current. When a loan is charged off or the
collateral is repossessed, the remaining income accrual is written off. 

Other Income  .
Other Income consists of income received from servicing activities, late fees
and other loan-related fees, income from investments, reinvestment revenue, GAP
insurance and extended service contracts, and unrealized loss on interest rate
derivative positions. Servicing revenue is accrued as services are rendered.
Late fees and other loan-related fees are recognized when received. Income from
investments and reinvestment revenue are accrued based on the respective
interest rate of such investment. Revenue from the sale of GAP insurance and
extended service contracts is recognized when sold as the Company has no
further obligation after the sale. Unrealized gain or loss on interest rate
derivatives is recognized when incurred. 

Advertising Costs.    The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.  

Allowance for Credit Losses  . The Company calculates the allowance for credit losses in accordance
with SFAS No. 5  , Accounting for Contingencies.   SFAS
No. 114,   Accounting By Creditors for Impairment of a Loan  
does not apply to loans currently held by the Company because they comprise a
large group of smaller balance homogenous loans that are evaluated collectively
for impairment. 

The
Company initiates efforts to make customer contact as early as when the
customer is one day past due and become more aggressive as the loan becomes
further past due. Management reviews past due loans and considers various
factors including payment history, job status and any events that may have
occurred that prevent the customer from making a payment. Through the
evaluation, if it is determined that the loan is uncollectible, the collateral
is typically repossessed. Generally this occurs at 60 to 90 days after the loan
becomes past due. Upon repossession, the uncollectible portion of the loan and
100% of accrued interest is written off. The fair value of the collateral is
recorded as an Assets Held for Sale. Fair value is determined by estimating the
proceeds from the sale of the collateral, which primarily are comprised of
auction proceeds on the sale of the automobile less selling related expenses.
After collection of all proceeds, the Company records an adjustment, positive
or negative, based on the difference between the fair value estimate and the
proceeds received. In the event the collateral cannot be located or if the
customer refuses to pay and is not subject to bankruptcy court protection, the
Company will write off the entire balance of the loan once it reaches 180 days
past due. If the customer is subject to bankruptcy court protection, the loan
generally remains in bankruptcy status as long as payments are being received
from the trustee. If a payment is missed, the Company seeks to repossess the
collateral with approval of the court. If the customer is dismissed from
bankruptcy, the Company resumes collection efforts.  

The
Company applies a systematic methodology in order to determine the amount of
the allowance for credit losses. The specific methodology is a six-month
migration analysis whereby the Company compares the aging  

20  

status of each loan on a date
which is six months prior to the reporting date, to the aging loan status as of
the reporting date. These factors are then applied to the aging status of each
loan at the reporting date in order to calculate the number of loans that are
expected to migrate to impaired status. The estimated number of impairments is
then multiplied by the estimated loss per loan, which is based on historical
information. Effective for the quarter ended April 30, 2005, the Company
elected to increase its allowance for loan losses against loans that were
greater than 120 days past due and loans in which the collateral had been
assigned for repossession but had not yet been repossessed as of the reporting
date. The Company believes that this increase is warranted in light of the
change in federal bankruptcy laws enacted during the period and the recognition
that the migration trends of severely delinquent loans and loans subject to
bankruptcy are expected to become more protracted. Based on this, the Company
has assigned a specific allowance against these loans equal to the outstanding
balance of loans in these categories less the estimated recovery amount based
on current data regarding liquidation of the collateral and collection of any
additional payments. The Company utilized its most recent recovery rates in
order to assess fair value of these loans. For loans that are not classified
into these categories, the historical migration pattern is utilized in order to
establish the estimated impairment. Despite the increase in allowance
associated with the higher delinquency loans and bankrupt accounts, the total
allowance for loan losses decreased during the period as a percentage of
Receivables Held for Investment due to improving overall delinquency trends and
lower repossession and loss rates. The allowance for credit losses is based on
estimates and qualitative evaluations. Ultimate losses may vary from current
estimates. These estimates are reviewed periodically and as adjustments, either
positive or negative, become necessary, are reported in earnings in the period
they become known.  

Stock-Based Compensation  .
The Company has an employee stock option plan and a non-employee director stock
option plan. The Company has adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148,
  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition
and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123  . This
pronouncement requires prominent disclosures in both annual and interim
financial statements regarding the method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results.
The Company accounts for stock compensation awards under the intrinsic value method
of Accounting Principles Board ( APB ) Opinion No. 25,   Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees   which requires compensation cost to be
recognized based on the excess, if any, between the quoted market price of the
stock at the date of grant and the amount an employee must pay to acquire the
stock. All options awarded under the Company s plan are granted with an
exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market value on the date of
the grant. 

Managed
Receivables   

The Company s managed receivables are (dollars in thousands):  

21  

The following table sets
forth information with regard to the Company s net interest spread, which
represents the difference between the effective yield on Receivables Held for
Investment and the Company s average cost of debt utilized to fund these
receivables, and its net interest margin (averages based on month-end
balances):  

(1) Represents interest income as a
percentage of average Receivables Held for Investment outstanding.  

  (2) Represents interest expense as a
percentage of average debt outstanding.  

  (3) Represents effective yield on Receivables
Held for Investment less average cost of debt.  

  (4) Represents net interest income as a
percentage of average Receivables Held for Investment outstanding.  

Net
interest income is the difference between interest earned from the receivables
portfolio and interest expense incurred on the credit facilities used to
finance the receivables. Net interest income was $6.4 million and $18.4 million
for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2006, respectively, an increase
of 22% and 18% when compared to amounts reported for the three and nine months
ended January 31, 2005, respectively.  

The amount of net interest income is the result of the relationship
between the average principal amount of receivables held and average rate
earned thereon and the average principal amount of debt incurred to finance
such receivables and the average rates paid thereon. Changes in the principal
amount and rate components associated with the receivables and debt can be
segregated to analyze the periodic changes in net interest income. The
following table analyzes the changes attributable to the principal amount and
rate components of net interest income (dollars in thousands):  

22  

Results of Operations   

Three Months and Nine months Ended January
31, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)   

Key Factors.   The
critical factors affecting the Company s profitability during any period are (i) loan origination volume and the
corresponding growth in Receivables Held For Investment; (ii) the level of net
interest spread, which is defined as the difference between the effective yield
on Receivables Held for Investment and the cost of funds under the Company s
credit facilities and securitizations utilized to finance these receivables;
(iii) the level of provision for credit losses; (iv) the amount of income
derived from other activities; and (v) the ability of the Company to control
operating expenses relative to the total amount of the managed portfolio. 

Executive Summary.   Net
income for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2006 was $318 and
$2,007, respectively, compared to $279 and $582 for the three and nine months
ended January 31, 2005. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $0.07
for the three months ended January 31, 2006 compared to $0.06 for the three
months ended January 31, 2005. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were
$0.45 and $0.44, respectively, for the nine months ended January 31, 2006
compared to $0.12 and $0.12 for the nine months ended January 31, 2005. The
increase in net income for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2006
compared to January 31, 2005 is due to (i) an increase in interest income from
a 48% increase for the three months ended January 31, 2006 and a 41% increase
for the nine months ended January 31, 2006 in average Receivables Held for
Investment, (ii) a decrease in loss
frequency and severity from repossessions and (iii) an increase in other
interest income due to a larger portion of the Company s cash being reinvested,
partially offset by several factors including (i) a decline in effective
yields, (ii) an increase in interest expense due to an increase in the average
debt outstanding and an increase in the effective rate, (iii) a decline in loan
servicing income, (iv) an increase in printing and postage expenses as a result
of an increase in direct to consumer loans, and 
(v) settlement costs and legal
fees totaling $694 associated with defending and settling a lawsuit brought
against a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. 

Interest Income  . Interest income for the three and nine months
ended January 31, 2006 increased to $10,332 and $28,774, respectively, compared
to $7,220 and $21,174 for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2005. 

The level of interest income, a primary
driver of financial results, is impacted by the average outstanding balance of
the portfolio of Receivables Held for Investment, the weighted average interest
rate on receivables originated by the Company, the mix of direct and indirect
receivables within Receivables Held for Investment, and the level of
prepayments and charge-offs. Interest income on Receivables Held for Investment
increased     43% and 36% for the three and nine
months ended January 31, 2006, respectively, compared to the three and nine
months ended January 31, 2005. The increase in interest income for the three
and nine months ended January 31, 2006 is due to a 48% and 41% increase in the
average portfolio outstanding for the three and nine months ended January 31,
2006 compared the three and nine months ended January 31, 2005. This is
partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of 43
basis points for the three months ended, and 48 basis points for the nine
months, ended January 31, 2006 compared to the three and nine months ended
January 31, 2005. This reflects the Company s increased focus on receivables
originated directly to consumers which typically carry lower interest rates.  

Interest Expense  . Interest expense for the three and nine months
ended January 31, 2006 increased     to $3,938 and
$10,374, respectively, compared to $1,964 and $5,570 for the three and nine
months ended January 31, 2005. Interest expense on borrowings related to
Receivables Held for Investment increased 100% and 86% for the three and nine
months ended January 31, 2006. The increase in interest expense is primarily
due to (i) the average debt outstanding increasing $118,512, or 53%, for the
three months ended January 31, 2006 and $93,253, or 44%, for the nine months
ended January 31, 2006 compared to the three and nine months ended January 31,
2005 as a result of a 48% and 41% increase in the average portfolio of
Receivables Held for Investment for the three and nine months ended January 31,
2006 compared to January 31, 2005 and (ii) an increase of 109 and 103 basis
points for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2006, respectively, in
the average cost of debt due to an increase in overall market interest rates as
a result of the current economic environment and market rate increases adopted
by the Federal Reserve Board. 

23  

Provision for Credit Losses   . The provision for credit losses for the three and nine months ended
January 31, 2006 decreased to $1,822 and $5,538, respectively, as compared to
$2,575 and $7,459 for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2005. The
decrease in provision for credit losses is primarily due to (i) improving
economic trends (ii) a change in the portfolio mix resulting in more loans
originated directly to the customer, which typically have a lower loss
frequency and (iii) a lower delinquency and repossession experience.  

Net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended
January 31, 2006 decreased to $1,853 and $5,559, respectively, compared to
$2,473 and $7,246 for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2005. The
decrease in net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended January 31,
2006 is primarily due to (i) a decrease in loss frequency and severity from
repossessions and (ii) an increase in recoveries from defaulted loans.  

The level of the
provision for credit losses is a key driver of overall financial performance
and should be positively impacted by improvement in general economic
conditions, improvements in wholesale used car prices and lower delinquency rates
and net losses projected for the portfolio of Receivables Held for Investment.
Any additional economic deterioration or decline in wholesale used car prices
will negatively impact provision expense to the extent that these events cause
an increase in delinquency rates, bankruptcy rates or net charge-off rates in
the portfolio of Receivables Held for Investment.  

Servicing Revenue   .   On
December 24, 2002, the Company entered into an agreement to provide loan
servicing and collection activities on behalf of FARC. FARC, which is 40% owned
by the Company, purchased a portfolio of approximately $200 million of
installment loan receivables. On March 19, 2003, the Company entered into an
agreement to provide loan servicing and collection activities on $276 million
of installment loan receivables for unrelated third parties.   Servicing
revenue decreased to $433 and $1,506     for the three
and nine months ended January 31, 2006 compared to $821 and $2,696     for three and nine months ended January 31, 2005.   The
decrease in servicing revenue for the three and nine months ended January 31,
2006 is due to the liquidation of serviced receivables during the quarter.
Revenue derived from servicing activities will increase or decrease in direct
proportion to the average outstanding balance of serviced receivables.  

Other Finance Charges and Fees.    Late and loan related fees decreased to $697 and $1,803 for the three and
nine months ended January 31, 2006, compared to $700 and $1,934 for the three
and nine months ended January 31, 2005.   The
decrease is attributable to lower delinquencies, partially offset by increased
assessment and collection of fees due to a 41% increase in the average
portfolio of Receivables Held for Investment. Income derived from late fees and collection activities are recognized
when received, and therefore can be potentially volatile from period to period
based on overall cash collection, seasonality, delinquency rates and other
factors.  

Late fees and other income are driven by a number of
factors including overall delinquency rates, the percentage of customers
utilizing electronic payment products and growth rates in the Company s direct
lending business which will affect the ability of the Company to generate fee
income from marketing insurance and warranty products.  

Insurance
Products.    Insurance products revenue decreased to $226 for the three months ended
January 31, 2006, compared to $237 for the three months ended January 31, 2005.
The decrease is attributable to (i) a decrease in the penetration rates of the
insurance products sold and (ii) lower gross margins due to the Company s
increased costs in purchasing the insurance products. This is partially offset
by an increase   of 29% in loan
originations for the three months ended January 31, 2006.   Insurance products revenue increased to $780 for the
nine months ended January 31, 2006, compared to $569 for the nine months ended
January 31, 2005. The increase is due to an increase   of 90% in loan originations for the nine months ended January 31, 2006.
This is partially offset by   lower gross margins due to the Company s increased costs in purchasing
the insurance products.   Insurance products
revenue is primarily driven by growth rates in the Company s direct lending
business which will affect the ability of the Company to generate fee income
from marketing insurance and warranty products.  

Income from Investment   . Income
from investment decreased to $96 and $333     for the three
and nine months ended January 31, 2006 compared to $157 and $527     for three and nine months ended January 31, 2005.   The
decrease in income from investment for the three and nine months ended January
31, 2006 is due to the liquidation of serviced receivables during the quarter.
Revenue derived from income from investment will increase or decrease in direct
proportion to the average outstanding balance of serviced receivables.  

24  

Other Interest Income.    Other interest income increased to $336 and $869 for the three and nine
months ended January 31, 2006, compared to $118 and $284 for the three and nine
months ended January 31, 2005. The increase is attributable to (i) an increase
in the average cash on hand balance due to increased collections as a result of
a 48% and 41% increase in the average portfolio of Receivables Held for
Investment for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2006 and (ii) an
increase in overall market interest rates as a result of the current economic
environment and market rate increases adopted by the Federal Reserve Board.  

Unrealized and Realized Gain/(Loss) on Interest
Rate Derivative Positions   . In conjunction with the adoption of
SFAS No. 133, the Company is required to record interest rate derivative
positions at fair value. A realized loss of $195 and $175 for the three and
nine months ended January 31, 2006, compared to an unrealized gain of $6 and an
unrealized loss of $232 for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2005
are principally due to changes in the fair value of the Company s derivative
positions.  

Salaries and Benefit Expenses  . Salaries and benefit expense increased to
$2,700 and $7,903 for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2006,
compared to $2,304 and $6,583 for the three and nine months ended January 31,
2005. The increase is primarily due to an increase in staff due to a 29% and
90% increase in loan originations for the three and nine months ended January
31, 2006, respectively. This is partially offset by a decrease in staff
associated with a decrease in the Company s serviced portfolio. 

Operating Expenses.   Operating expenses increased to $1,226 for the
three months ended January 31, 2006, compared to $1,087 for the three months
ended January 31, 2005, while operating expenses decreased to $2,954 for the
nine months ended January 31, 2006, compared to $3,771 for the nine months
ended January 31, 2005. Expenses
characterized as operating expenses are generally variable in nature and are
typically dependent on a number of factors including origination volume, the
outstanding balance of the managed portfolio, credit quality and operating
efficiency levels. The increase for the three months ended January 31, 2006 was
primarily due to  increased costs in
generating higher direct loan originations. This was partially offset by an
increase in the dollar amount of expenses which the Company was able to
capitalize as deferred acquisition costs. The decrease for the nine months
ended January 31, 2006 was primarily due to an increase in the dollar amount of
expenses which the Company was able to capitalize as deferred acquisition
costs. Although expenses increased during the nine month period, the Company
was able to capitalize a higher level of these expenses due to the significant
increase in origination volume and increased efficiency in its loan origination
functions. The decline in operating expenses was also positively impacted by
lower collection-related costs as a result of improving credit quality. 

General and Administrative.   General and administrative expenses increased to
$1,655 and $3,668 for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2006,
compared to $960 and $2,819 for the three and nine months ended January 31,
2005. The three and nine months ended January 31, 2006 experienced an increase
in professional fees due to the Company s defense in a class action lawsuit.
General and administrative costs tend to be more fixed in nature and not as
dependent on the overall level of managed receivables. 

For
the three months ended January 31, 2006, the Company incurred legal expenses of
$214 and accrued legal expenses of $30 and settlement costs of $450 in
connection with its defense and settlement of a class action lawsuit filed
against a wholly-owned subsidiary alleging violations of the Fair Credit
Reporting Act. The Company s decision to settle the lawsuit was prompted by the
trial court s granting the plaintiff s motion for summary judgment on January
20, 2006. The Company and its counsel believe that the court s ruling is
contrary to the statute and the facts in the case, and believe that an appeal
would be successful. However, given the trial court s ruling, the Company
concluded that settlement is preferable to continuing to incur the costs
associated with the appeal and defense of the lawsuit. The settlement is
subject to approval of the court, which is anticipated on March 15, 2006.  

Other
than the litigation described above, the Company is not involved in any
litigation which might be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
Company s business or operations.  

Other Interest Expense  . Other interest expense increased to $357 and $922 for
the three and nine months ended January 31, 2006, compared to $140 and $375 for
the three and nine months ended January 31, 2005. The increase was primarily
due to (i) a 50% and 33% increase for the three and nine months ended January
31, 2006,  respectively, in the average
outstanding borrowings on the Company s working capital line and (ii) the
related 

25  

party
note having an average outstanding balance of $2,500 for the three and nine
months ended January 31, 2006, as compared to an average outstanding balance of
$0 for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2005.  

Portfolio Characteristics   

General   .
In selecting receivables for inclusion in its portfolio, the Company seeks to
identify potential borrowers whom it regards as creditworthy despite credit
histories that limit their access to traditional sources of consumer credit. In
addition to personal credit qualifications, the Company attempts to assure that
the characteristics of the automobile sold and the terms of the sale are likely
to result in a consistently performing receivable. These considerations include
amount financed, monthly payments required, duration of the loan, age of the
automobile, mileage on the automobile and other factors.  

Customer Profile   .
The Company s primary goal in credit evaluation is to make loans to customers
having stable personal situations, predictable incomes and the ability and
inclination to perform their obligations in a timely manner. Many of the
Company s customers are persons who have experienced credit difficulties in the
past by reason of illness, divorce, job loss, reduction in pay or other
adversities, but who appear to the Company to have the capability and
commitment to meet their obligations. Through its credit evaluation process,
the Company seeks to distinguish these persons from those applicants who are
chronically poor credit risks.  

Credit Evaluation   

General   .
In connection with the origination of a receivable by the Company, the Company
follows systematic procedures designed to eliminate unacceptable risks. This
involves a three-step process in which (i) the creditworthiness of the borrower
and the terms of the proposed transaction are evaluated and either approved,
declined or modified by the Company s credit verification department, (ii) the
loan documentation and collateralization is reviewed by the Company s funding
department, and (iii) additional collateral verification procedures and customer
interviews are conducted by the Company. During the course of this process, the
Company s credit verification and funding personnel coordinate closely with the
finance and insurance departments of the dealers or with individuals to whom
the Company lends directly. The Company has developed financing programs under
which it approves loans that vary in pricing and loan terms depending on the
relative credit risk determined for each loan. Credit or default risk is
evaluated by the Company s loan officers in conjunction with a proprietary,
empirical credit scoring model developed from the Company s 17 year database of
non-prime lending results.  

Collateral Verification   .
As a condition to the origination of each receivable by the Company, the
Company performs an individual audit evaluation to verify the details of the
credit application, and to confirm that the material terms of the sale conform
to the purchaser s understanding of the transaction. In the majority of
circumstances for dealer indirect loans, the Company conducts a personal
telephonic interview with each prospective obligor. For direct to consumer
loans, the Company verifies all information during the normal underwriting
procedures. The Company will originate a receivable only after receipt and review
of a satisfactory audit report.  

Liquidity and
Capital Resources   

Sources and Uses of Cash Flows  .
The Company s business requires significant cash flow to support its operating
activities. The principal cash requirements include (i) amounts necessary to acquire
receivables from dealers and fund required reserve accounts, (ii) amounts
necessary to fund premiums for credit enhancement insurance or other credit
enhancement required by the Company s financing programs, and (iii) amounts
necessary to fund costs to retain receivables, primarily interest expense. The
Company also requires a significant amount of cash flow for working capital to
fund fixed operating expenses, primarily salaries and benefits. 

The Company s most significant cash flow requirement is for the
origination of receivables. The Company originated $41.6 million and $189.9
million of receivables to be held for investment for the three and nine months
ended January 31, 2006 compared to $37.7 million and $104.9 million for the
three and nine months ended January 31, 2005.  

The Company funds loan originations through a combination of two
warehouse credit facilities. The FIRC credit facility generally permits the
Company to borrow up to the outstanding principal balance of qualified  

26  

receivables, not to exceed $50
million. Receivables that have accumulated in the FIRC credit facility may be
transferred to the FIARC commercial paper facility at the option of the
Company. The FIARC commercial paper facility provides an additional financing
source of up to $150 million. Additionally, the Company has transferred
receivables from the warehouse credit facilities and issued term notes.
Substantially all of the Company s receivables are pledged to collateralize
these credit facilities and term notes. The Company is obligated to meet
certain financial covenants. Noncompliance may significantly affect cash flow.  

The Company s most significant source of cash flow is the principal and
interest payments received from its receivables portfolios. The Company
received such payments in the amount of $34.6 million and $110.2     million during the three and nine months ended January 31,
2006, and $30.2 million and $91.3 million during the three and nine months
ended January 31, 2005. Such cash flow funds were used to repay amounts
borrowed under the Company s credit facilities and for other holding costs,
primarily interest expense, and servicing and custodial fees. During the three
and nine months ended January 31, 2006, the Company required net cash of $7.0
million and $79.8 million as compared to $7.6 million and $13.6 for the three
and nine months ended January 31, 2005, as the receivables originated exceeded
portfolio collections. The Company relies on borrowed funds to provide cash
flow in periods of growth. As of January 31, 2006, the Company had $178.3
million of available capacity in the FIRC and FIARC credit facilities to fund
future growth.  

In addition to the cash flow
generated from the principal and interest collections on its receivables
portfolio, the Company collects servicing fees from its managed receivables
portfolio. Servicing fees range from 1.4% to 2.5% of the outstanding principal
balance of the loans in the portfolio. Cash flow and servicing fees are
received after month end, but relate to the prior month activity. Thus upon
filing of the monthly servicing statements, a portion of the restricted cash is
converted to cash available to fund operations. At January 31, 2006 and 2005,
the Company s unencumbered cash was $4,173,400 and $721,167 respectively. The
increase in available cash is primarily due to (i) an increase in revenues due
to a 48% increase in the average portfolio of Receivables Held for Investment
and (ii) an increase in the amount due under the working capital line of credit
of $4.6 million. Management believes the unencumbered cash and cash inflows and
amounts available under the working capital facility are adequate to fund cash
requirements for operations.  

Capitalization   . The
Company expects to rely primarily on its credit facilities and the issuance of
secured term notes to acquire and retain receivables. The Company believes its
existing credit facilities have adequate capacity to fund the increase of the
receivables portfolio expected in the foreseeable future. While the Company has
no reason to believe that these facilities will not continue to be available,
their termination could have a material adverse effect on the Company s
operations if substitute financing on comparable terms was not obtained.  

Financing Arrangements.   The Company finances its loan origination
through two warehouse credit facilities. The Company s credit facilities
provide for one-year terms and have been renewed annually. Management of the
Company believes that the credit facilities will continue to be renewed or
extended or that it would be able to secure alternate financing on satisfactory
terms; however, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so. In
January, 2002 the Company issued $159 million in asset-backed notes ( Term
Notes ) secured by discrete pools of receivables. These notes were subsequently
called and redeemed in March, 2005. In November, 2003, the Company issued $140
million in Term Notes secured by a discrete pool of receivables. In May, 2005,
the Company issued $175 million in Term Notes secured by a discrete pool of
receivables. In January, 2006, the Company issued $189 million in Term Notes
secured by a discrete pool of receivables. Substantially all receivables
retained by the Company are pledged as collateral for the credit facilities and
the Term Notes. The weighted average interest rate for the Company s secured
borrowings including the effect of program fees and dealer fees was 3.5% and
4.4% for the periods ended January 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively.

Default Insurance (ALPI)  

FIRC   - In order to
obtain a lower cost of funding, the Company has agreed to maintain credit
enhancement insurance covering the receivables pledged as collateral under the
FIRC credit facility. The facility lenders are named as additional insureds
under these policies. The coverages are obtained on each receivable at the time
it is originated by the Company, and the applicable premiums are prepaid for
the life of the receivable. Each receivable is covered by three separate credit
insurance policies, consisting of basic default insurance under a standard auto
loan protection policy (known as  ALPI  insurance) together with certain
supplemental coverages relating to physical damage and other risks. Solely at
its expense, the Company carries these coverages and neither the vehicle purchasers
nor the dealers are charged for the coverages, nor are they usually aware of
their existence. The Company s ALPI insurance policy is written by National
Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh ( National Union ), which is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of American International Group. 

The premiums that the Company paid during the three months and nine
months ended January 31, 2006 for its three credit enhancement insurance
coverages, of which the largest component is basic ALPI insurance, represented
approximately 2.1% of the principal amount of the receivables originated during
the periods. Aggregate premiums paid for ALPI coverage alone were $1,028,980
and $584,613 during the three months ended, and $2,645,416 and $3,156,179 for
nine months ended, January 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively, and accounted for
2.8% and 1.2% during the three months ended, and 2.6% and 1.6% for the nine
months ended, January 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively, of the principal amount
of the receivables originated during such respective periods.  

In April 1994, the Company organized First Investors Insurance Company
(the  Insurance Subsidiary ) under the captive insurance company laws of the
State of Vermont. The Insurance Subsidiary is an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company and is a party to a reinsurance agreement whereby the
Insurance Subsidiary reinsures 100% of the risk under the Company s ALPI
insurance policy. At the time each receivable is insured by National Union, the
risk is automatically reinsured to its full extent and approximately 96% of the
premium paid by the Company to National Union with respect to such receivable
is ceded to the Insurance Subsidiary. When a loss covered by the ALPI policy
occurs, National Union pays it after the claim is processed, and National Union
is then reimbursed in full by the Insurance Subsidiary. In addition to the
monthly premiums and liquidity reserves of the Insurance Subsidiary, a trust
account is maintained by National Union to secure the Insurance Subsidiary s
obligations for losses it has reinsured.  

28  

The result of the foregoing reinsurance structure is that National
Union, as the  fronting  insurer under the captive arrangement, is
unconditionally obligated to the Company s credit facility lenders for all
losses covered by the ALPI policy, and the Company, through its Insurance
Subsidiary, is obligated to indemnify National Union for all such losses. As of
January 31, 2006, the Insurance Subsidiary had capital and surplus of
$2,761,279 and unencumbered cash reserves of $1,660,665 in addition to
$3,393,022 in a trust account.  

The ALPI coverage as well as the Insurance Subsidiary s liability under
the Reinsurance Agreement, remains in effect for each receivable that is
pledged as collateral under the warehouse credit facility. Once receivables are
transferred from FIRC to FIARC and financed under the commercial paper
facility, ALPI coverage and the Insurance Subsidiary s liability under the
Reinsurance Agreement is cancelled with respect to the transferred receivables.
Any unearned premium associated with the transferred receivables is returned to
the Company. The Company believes the losses its Insurance Subsidiary will be
required to indemnify will be less than the premiums ceded to it. However,
there can be no assurance that losses will not exceed the premiums ceded and
the capital and surplus of the Insurance Subsidiary.  

FIARC     Credit
Enhancement for the FIARC warehouse facility is provided to the commercial
paper investors by a cash reserve account equal to 1% of the receivables held
by FIARC and, additionally, a surety bond issued by MBIA. The Company is not a
guarantor of, or otherwise a party to, such commercial paper.

On December 4, 2003, the FIRC facility was renewed,
under similar terms and conditions, at the $50 million commitment level until
December 2, 2004, and was subsequently extended until February 14, 2007. On
June 15, 2004, the FIRC facility was increased to $65 million, and reverted
back to $50 million on September 13, 2004. As of April 30, 2005 and January 31,
2006, there was $43.6 million and $21.7, respectively, outstanding.  

On January 29, 2004, following a short-term
extension of the original maturity date, the FIARC facility was renewed, under
similar terms and conditions, to December 2, 2004, and was subsequently
extended until March 15, 2006. As of April 30, 2005 and January 31, 2006, there
was $127.9 and $0, respectively, outstanding.  

Management presently intends to seek further extensions to these
warehouse facilities prior to the current expiration dates. Management further
considers its relationship with its lenders to be satisfactory and has no
reason to believe that the FIRC and FIARC facilities will not be renewed at
each of their respective expiration dates.

Auto Trust totaled $135,643,109, which was previously owned by FIRC and FIARC,
secured the 2002-A Term Notes. In addition to the issuance of the Class A
Notes, the 2002 Auto Trust also issued a $4,819,000 Class B Note that was
retained by the Company and pledged to secure the Working Capital Facility as

asset quality covenants were not met, the reserve account target level would
increase to 6% of the then current principal balance of the receivables pool.
On February 28, 2005, the Company notified the note holders of the 2002-A
securitization of its intent to exercise its prepayment call provision. This
call provision was completed effective March 15, 2005, and therefore there was
no outstanding balance as of January 31, 2006 and April 30, 2005. 

On
November 20, 2003, the Company, through its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary
First Investors Auto Owner Trust 2003-A ( 2003 Auto Trust ) completed the issuance

B Note does not bear interest but requires principal reductions sufficient to
reduce the balance of the Class B Note to 3.9% of the outstanding balance of
the underlying receivables pool. A surety bond issued by MBIA Insurance
Corporation  

30  

provides credit enhancement for
the Class A Notes. In the event that certain asset quality covenants are not
met, the reserve account target level will increase to 6% of the then current
principal balance of the receivables pool. As of April 30, 2005, and January
31, 2006, the outstanding principal balances on the 2003-A term notes were
$70,050,511 and $44,184,622, respectively.  

On

the underlying receivables pool. A surety bond issued by MBIA Insurance
Corporation provides credit enhancement for the Class A Notes. In the event
that certain asset quality covenants are not met, the reserve account target
level will increase to 2% of the then current principal balance of the

the 2005-A Class A-1 and Class A-2 Term notes were $15,804,317 and $106,493,000
respectively.  

On
January 26, 2006, the Company, through its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary
First Investors Auto Owner Trust 2006-A ( 2006 Auto Trust ) completed the
issuance of $32,000,000 of 4.57% Class A-1 asset-backed notes, $47,000,000 of

initial pool of automobile receivables transferred to the 2006 Auto Trust
totaled $151,939,112, was previously owned by FIRC and FIARC, and secures the
2006-A Term Notes. In addition to the issuance of the Class A-1, Class A-2,
Class A-3, and Class A-4 notes, the 2006 Auto Trust also issued a $2,879,112
Class B Note that was retained by the Company and pledged to secure the Working
Capital Facility as further described below. Proceeds from the issuance, which
totaled $188,445,709 were used to (i) fund a $40,000,000 pre-funding account to
be used for future loan originations; (ii) repay all outstanding borrowings
under the FIARC commercial paper facility, (iii) reduce the outstanding
borrowings under the FIRC credit facility, (iv) pay transaction fees related to

1% or $1,519,391 of the initial receivables pledged. The 2006-A Term Notes
require monthly principal reductions sufficient to reduce the balance of the
notes to 96.75% of the outstanding balance of the underlying receivables pool.
The final maturity of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, and Class A-4 Term
Notes is January 16, 2007, March 16, 2009, February 15, 2011, and April 15,
2013, respectively. The Class B Note does not bear interest but requires
principal reductions sufficient to reduce the balance of the Class B Note to
3.25% of the outstanding balance of the underlying receivables pool. A surety
bond issued by MBIA Insurance Corporation provides credit enhancement for the
Class A Notes. In the event that certain asset quality covenants are not met,
the reserve account target level will increase to the greater of 2% of the
initial pool balance or 6% of the then current principal balance of the
receivables pool. As of January 31, 2006, there were no principal payments made
on the 2006-A Term Notes, and the outstanding balance is equal to the original
issuance amount of $189,060,000.  

Working Capital Facility  . The facility is provided to a special-purpose, wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company, First Investors Residual Funding LP. This facility
revolves monthly in accordance with a borrowing base consisting of the
overcollateralization amount and reserve account for each of the Company s other
credit facilities. The facility is secured solely by the residual cash flow and
cash reserve accounts related to the Company s warehouse credit facilities and
the existing and future term note facilities. The outstanding borrowings under
the facility bear interest at one-month LIBOR plus 2.25%. In addition, a
commitment fee of 1.5% is paid on the total amount of this facility. On October
26, 2004, the Working Capital Facility was extended 

31  

until October 10, 2005,
increasing the commitment amount from $9 million to $13.5 million. The interest
rate remained at LIBOR plus 2.25% and the commitment fee paid on the total
available amount of the facility was maintained at 1.5%. On August 15, 2005,
the Working Capital Facility was extended until February 15, 2006, increasing
the commitment amount to $23.5 million, and was subsequently extended on
February 15, 2006 until February 14, 2007. The interest rate remained at LIBOR
plus 2.25% and the commitment fee paid on the total available amount of the
facility was maintained at 1.5%. As of April 30, 2005 and January 31, 2006,
there was $10,500,000 and $15,149,641, respectively, outstanding under this
facility.  

The
Company presently intends to seek a renewal of the working capital facility
from its lender prior to maturity. Should the facility not be renewed, the
outstanding balance of the receivables would be amortized in accordance with
the borrowing base. Management considers its relationship with its lenders to
be satisfactory and has no reason to believe that this credit facility will not
be renewed. If the facility is not renewed, however, or if material changes are
made to its terms and conditions, it could have a material adverse effect on
the Company.  

Related Party Loans.   On December 3, 2001 the Company entered into an agreement with one of
its shareholders who is a member of its Board of Directors under which the
Company may, from time to time, borrow up to $2.5 million. On December 6, 2004,
the original $2.5 million shareholder loan was replaced with a $2.5 million
loan containing identical terms and conditions between the Company and a
limited partnership that is affiliated with a current shareholder and member of
the Board of Directors  The proceeds of the
borrowings have been utilized to fund certain private and open market purchases
of the Company s common stock pursuant to a Stock Repurchase Plan authorized by
the Board of Directors and for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the
facility bear interest at a fixed rate of 10% per annum. The facility is
unsecured and expressly subordinated to the Company s senior credit facilities.
The facility matures on December 3, 2008 but may be repaid at any time unless
the Company is in default on one of its other credit facilities. There was $2.5
million outstanding under this facility as of April 30, 2005 and January 31,
2006. The Company recorded interest expense of $0 and $63,014 for the three
months ended, and $0 and $189,041 for the nine months ended, January 31, 2005
and 2006, respectively. 

Loan Covenants  . The
documentation governing these credit facilities and Term Notes contains
numerous covenants relating to the Company s business, the maintenance of
credit enhancement insurance covering the receivables (if applicable), the
observance of certain financial covenants, the avoidance of certain levels of
delinquency experience and other matters. The breach of these covenants, if not
cured within the time limits specified, could precipitate events of default
that might result in the acceleration of the FIRC credit facility, the Term
Notes and the working capital facility or the termination of the commercial
paper facilities. The Company was not in default with respect to any financial
and non-financial covenants governing these financing arrangements at January
31, 2006. 

Interest Rate Management  .
The Company s warehouse credit facilities and working capital facilities bear
interest at floating interest rates which are reset on a short-term basis while
the secured Term Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of interest. The Company s
receivables bear interest at fixed rates that do not generally vary with a
change in market interest rates. Since a primary contributor to the Company s
profitability is its ability to manage its net interest spread, the Company
seeks to maximize the net interest spread while minimizing exposure to changes
in interest rates. In connection with managing the net interest spread, the
Company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps or caps to minimize the
effects of market interest rate fluctuations on the net interest spread. To the
extent that the Company has outstanding floating rate borrowings or has elected
to convert a portion of its borrowings from fixed rates to floating rates, the
Company will be exposed to fluctuations in short-term interest rates. 

During the nine months ended January 31, 2006, as a
requirement of the FIARC commercial paper facility, the Company entered into
seven interest rate cap transactions, with a strike rate of 6%. The aggregate
initial notional amount of the caps was $131,710,159 which amortizes over six
years. The Company paid $449,746 in premium to purchase these caps.  On January 26, 2006, the Company terminated all
interest rate caps outstanding in exchange for proceeds of $275,000. The caps
were terminated following the repayment of all balances outstanding under the
FIARC facility prior to the issuance of the 2006-A Term Notes. As a result, a
realized loss of $174,746 was incurred relative to the aggregate market value
of the interest rate caps.  

32  

During fiscal year 2005, as a requirement of
the FIARC commercial paper facility, the Company entered into nine interest
rate cap transactions, with strike rates between 5% and 6%. The aggregate
initial notional amount of the caps was $126,086,843 which amortized over six
years. The Company paid an aggregate of $1,213,097 in premiums to purchase
these caps. The interest rate caps were not designated as hedges, and
accordingly, changes in the fair value of the interest rate caps were recorded
as unrealized gains or losses and reflected in net income. On April 28, 2005,
the Company terminated all interest rate caps outstanding in exchange for
proceeds of $840,000. The caps were terminated following the repayment of all
balances outstanding under the FIARC facility prior to the issuance of the
2005-A term notes. As a result, a realized loss of $373,097 was incurred
relative to the aggregate market value of the interest rate caps.  

Delinquency and Credit Loss
Experience   

The
Company s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be
adversely affected by nonperforming receivables. The Company seeks to manage
its risk of credit loss through (i) prudent credit evaluations, (ii) risk
management activities, (iii) effective collection procedures, and (iv) by
maximizing recoveries on defaulted loans. The allowance for credit losses of
$2,227,471 as of January 31, 2006 and $2,248,599 as of April 30, 2005 as a
percentage of Receivables Held for Investment of $336,005,497 as of January 31,
2006 and $244,940,526 as of April 30, 2005 was 0.7% and 0.9% respectively.  

The
Company considers a loan to be delinquent when the borrower fails to make a
scheduled payment of principal and interest. Accrual of interest is suspended
when the payment from the borrower is over 90 days past due. Generally,
repossession procedures are initiated 90 to 120 days after the payment default.  

The
Company retains the credit risk associated with the receivables originated. The
Company purchases credit enhancement insurance from third party insurers, which
covers the risk of loss upon default and certain other risks. The Company
established a captive insurance subsidiary to reinsure certain risks under the
credit enhancement insurance coverage for all receivables. In addition,
receivables financed under the Auto Trust and FIARC commercial paper facilities
do not carry default insurance. Provisions for credit losses of $1,821,667 and $5,537,895
for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2006 compared to and $2,574,748
and $7,459,259 for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2005 have been
recorded.  

The Company calculates the allowance for credit losses in accordance
with SFAS No. 5  , Accounting for Contingencies.   SFAS
No. 114,   Accounting By Creditors for Impairment of a Loan  
does not apply to loans currently held by the Company because they are
comprised of a large group of smaller balance homogenous loans that are
evaluated collectively for impairment.  

The
Company applies a systematic methodology in order to determine the amount of
the allowance for credit losses. The specific methodology is a six-month
migration analysis whereby the Company compares the aging status of each loan
from six months prior to the aging loan status as of the reporting date. These
factors are then applied to the aging status of each loan at the reporting date
in order to calculate the number of loans that are expected to migrate to
impaired status. The estimated number of impairments is then multiplied by the
estimated loss per loan, which is based on historical information. During the
quarter ended April 30, 2005, the Company elected to increase its allowance for
loan losses against loans that were greater than 120 days past due and loans in
which the collateral had been assigned for repossession but had not yet been
repossessed as of the reporting date. The Company believes that this increase
is warranted in light of the change in federal bankruptcy laws enacted during
the period and the recognition that the migration trends of severely delinquent
loans and loans subject to bankruptcy are expected to become more protracted.
Based on this, the Company has assigned a specific allowance against these loans
equal to the outstanding balance of loans in these categories less the
estimated recovery amount based on current data regarding liquidation of the
collateral and collection of any additional payments. The Company utilized its
most recent recovery rates in order to assess fair value of these loans. For
loans that are not classified into these categories, the historical migration
pattern is utilized in order to establish the estimated impairment. Despite the
increase in allowance associated with the higher delinquency loans and bankrupt
accounts, the total allowance for loan losses decreased during the period as a
percentage of Receivables Held for Investment due to improving overall
delinquency trends and lower repossession and loss rates. The allowance for
credit losses is based on estimates and qualitative evaluations. Ultimate
losses may vary from current estimates. These estimates are reviewed
periodically and as adjustments, either positive or negative, become necessary,
are reported in earnings in the period they become known.  

33  

The following table sets forth certain information regarding the
Company s delinquency and charge-off experience over its last two fiscal years
(dollars in thousands):  

(1)           Delinquent amounts outstanding do not
include loans in bankruptcy status since collection activity is limited and
highly regulated for bankrupt accounts.  

(2)           The percentages have been annualized
and are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year.  

The
lower annualized charge-off rate results from an improving economic environment
coupled with an increase in the Company s direct to consumer lending program
and higher recovery rates on repossessions.  

As of
January 31, 2006, there were 298 accounts totaling $3,348,178 that were in
bankruptcy status and were more than 30 days past due. As of January 31, 2005,
there were 379 accounts totaling $3,869,214 that were in bankruptcy status and
were more than 30 days past due. As of January 31, 2006 and 2005, 80% and 89%,
respectively, of the bankruptcy delinquencies filed for protection under
Chapter 13.  

New Accounting Pronouncements   

In
February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,  Accounting for Certain
Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and
140  ( SFAS 155 ). This statement amends SFAS No. 133,  Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  ( SFAS 133 ), and SFAS
No. 140,  Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishments of Liabilities  and resolves issues addressed in SFAS 133
Implementation Issue No. D1,  Application of Statement 133 to Beneficial
Interest in Securitized Financial Assets . This Statement: (a) permits
fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an
embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation;
(b) clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not
subject to the requirements of SFAS 133; (c) establishes a requirement to
evaluate beneficial interests in securitized financial assets to identify
interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial
instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation;
(d) clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of
subordination are not embedded derivatives; and, (e) eliminates
restrictions on a qualifying special-purpose entity s ability to hold passive
derivative financial instruments that pertain to beneficial interests that are
or contain a derivative financial instrument. The standard also requires
presentation within the financial statements that identifies those hybrid
financial instruments for which the fair value election has been applied and
information on the income statement impact of the changes in fair value of
those instruments. The Company is required to apply SFAS 155 to all financial
instruments acquired, issued or subject to a remeasurement event beginning January 1,
2007 although early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entity s
fiscal year. The provisions of SFAS 155 are not expected to have a financial
statement impact recorded at adoption; however, the standard could affect the
future income recognition for securitized   

34  

financial assets because there
may be more embedded derivatives identified with changes in fair value
recognized in net income.  

In
May 2005, SFAS No. 154,  Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,  was issued.
This statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and
requires retrospective application to prior periods  financial statements of
changes in accounting principle, unless this would be impracticable. This
statement also makes a distinction between  retrospective application  of an
accounting principle and the  restatement  of financial statements to reflect
the correction of an error. This statement is effective for accounting changes
and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2005. The Company does not expect the adoption of this interpretation to have a
material impact on its financial position, cash flows and results of
operations.  

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R),   Share-Based
Payment - a revision to SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation   ( SFAS
No. 123(R) ) that addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions
in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity
instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair
value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the
issuance of such equity instruments. SFAS No. 123(R) eliminates the ability to
account for share-based compensation transactions using APB Opinion No. 25,   Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees  , and generally
requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a
fair-value-based method.  

SFAS
No. 123(R) is effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year that begins
after June 15, 2005. SFAS 123(R) applies to all awards granted after the
required effective date and to such awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled
after that date. The cumulative effect of initially applying SFAS No. 123(R),
if any, is recognized as of the required effective date. As of the required
effective date, all public entities that used the fair-value-based method for
either recognition or disclosure under SFAS No. 123 will apply SFAS No. 123(R)
using a modified version of the prospective application. Under that transition
method, compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date
for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not
yet been rendered, based on the grant-date fair value of those awards
calculated under SFAS No. 123 for either recognition or pro forma disclosures.
For periods before the required effective date, those entities may elect to
apply a modified version of retrospective application under which financial
statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro
forma disclosures required for those periods by SFAS No. 123. The Company has
not yet completed its evaluation of the impact that SFAS No. 123(R) will have
on its financial position and results of operations.  

Forward Looking Information   

Statements
and financial discussion and analysis included in this report that are not
historical are considered to be forward-looking in nature. Forward-looking
statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual
results to differ materially from anticipated results. Specific factors that
could cause such differences include unexpected fluctuations in market interest
rates, changes in economic conditions, changes in the competition for loans, or
the inability to renew or obtain financing. Further information concerning
risks and uncertainties is included in this report and the company s other
reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

The Company believes the factors discussed in its reports are important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
expressed in any forward looking statement made herein or elsewhere by the
Company or on its behalf. The factors listed are not necessarily all of the
important factors. Unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed could also
have material adverse effects on actual results. The Company does not intend to
update its description of important factors each time a potential important
factor arises. The Company advises its stockholders that they should:  (1) be aware that important factors not
described herein could affect the accuracy of our forward looking statements,
and (2) use caution and common sense when analyzing our forward looking
statements in this document or elsewhere. All of such forward looking
statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.  

35  

ITEM 3.        QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT   MARKET RISK     

The
market risk discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the analysis
that follows are forward-looking statements of market risk assuming certain
adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially
due to changes in the Company s product and debt mix, developments in the
financial markets, and further utilization by the company of risk-mitigating
strategies such as hedging.  

The
Company s operating revenues are derived almost entirely from the collection of
interest on the receivables it retains and its primary expense is the interest
that it pays on borrowings incurred to purchase and retain such receivables.
The Company s credit facilities bear interest at floating rates which are reset
on a short-term basis, whereas its receivables bear interest at fixed rates
which do not generally vary with changes in interest rates. The Company is
therefore exposed primarily to market risks associated with movements in
interest rates on its credit facilities. The Company believes that it takes the
necessary steps to appropriately reduce the potential impact of interest rate
increases on the Company s financial position and operating performance.  

The
Company relies almost exclusively on revolving credit facilities to fund its
origination of receivables. Periodically, the Company will transfer receivables
from a revolving to a term credit facility. Currently all of the Company s
credit facilities in bear interest at floating rates tied to either a commercial
paper index or LIBOR.  

As
of January 31, 2006, the Company had $36.8 million of floating rate secured
debt outstanding under the FIRC warehouse and working capital facilities. For
every 1% increase in LIBOR annual after-tax earnings would decrease by approximately
$.2 million assuming the Company maintains a level amount of floating rate debt
and assuming an immediate increase in rates. As of January 31, 2005, the
Company had $133.6 million of floating rate secured debt outstanding net of
swap and cap agreements. For every 1% increase in commercial paper rates or
LIBOR, annual after-tax earnings would decrease by approximately $.9 million
assuming the Company maintains a level amount of floating rate debt and
assuming an immediate increase in rates.  

ITEM 4.        CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

In accordance
with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, we carried out an evaluation, under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of January 31, 2006 to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and
forms.  

There has been
no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred
during the three months ended January 31, 2006 that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial
reporting.

Section
2.10              Federal Income Tax Matters   . 

(a)           It is the intent of the Depositor
that, for purposes of federal income, state and local income and franchise tax
and any other taxes, the Trust will not be treated as an association or
publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation. Any person having an
interest in the Certificate, including the Seller, by acceptance of its
interest in the Certificate, and the Owner Trustee agree to such treatment and
agree to take no action inconsistent with such treatment, including the making
of an election under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3 on behalf of the
Trust such that the Trust is treated as an association taxable as a
corporation.  

(b)           It is the intention of the Depositor
that, solely for income and franchise tax purposes, the Trust, shall be treated
as (i) a division of the Certificateholder that is ignored as an entity
separate from the Certificateholder if, for federal income tax purposes, there
is a single Certificateholder or (ii) a partnership if, for federal income tax
purposes, the Trust is considered to have more than one Certificateholder. The
parties agree that, unless otherwise required by appropriate tax authorities,
the Trust will file or cause to be filed annual or other necessary returns,
reports and other forms consistent with the characterization of the Trust, as
it relates to the assets in the Trust and the Certificate, as a division of the
Certificateholder or partnership, as just described, for such tax purposes and
that such parties will take no action inconsistent with such treatment.  

(c)           Pursuant to the Administration
Agreement, the Administrator has agreed to perform the following actions on
behalf of the Trust: (i) deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the
Certificateholder, as may be required by the Code and applicable Treasury
Regulations, such information as may be required (including Schedule K-1 to IRS
Form 1065, if the Trust, is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes), to enable the Certificateholder to prepare its federal and state
income tax returns, (ii) prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to
be filed, all tax returns relating to the Trust (including a partnership
information return and IRS Form 1065 if the Trust is treated as a partnership
for federal income tax purposes) and the Certificateholders shall direct the
Administrator in writing to make such elections as may from time to time be
required or appropriate under any applicable state or federal statute or rule
or regulation thereunder so as to maintain the characterization of the Trust as
a division of a single Certificateholder or a partnership, as the case may be,
for federal income tax purposes (in each case, in the sole determination of the
Certificateholders unless otherwise required by appropriate taxing authorites)
and (iii) prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be filed,
deliver or cause to be delivered any annual or other necessary returns, reports
or forms relating to the Notes and the Certificate (including information
returns on IRS Form 1099). The Trust shall make all elections pursuant to this
Section 2.10 on returns relating to the Certificate, if any, furnished to it in
execution form by the Administrator and any other returns as may be required by
law and so furnished to it by and at the direction of the Administrator, and in
doing so shall be entitled to, and shall be fully protected if it shall, rely
entirely upon, and shall have no liability for information provided by, or
calculations provided by, the Administrator. All tax returns in respect of the
Trust shall be signed by the Seller, and if the Seller shall no longer hold the
Certificate, the Certificateholder holding the greatest percentage interest in
the Certificate, unless some other party is required by law to sign such return
(in which case such other party shall sign). If the Trust is characterized as a
partnership for federal income tax  

8  

purposes, the Seller, and
if the Seller shall no longer hold any Owner Trust Certificate, the
Certificateholder holding the greatest percentage interest, shall be the  tax
matters partner  of the Trust pursuant to the Code.  

(d)           The holder of an interest in the
Certificate shall not sell or suffer to be transferred such interest unless it
shall first have either received an opinion of counsel to the effect that such
sale or transfer would not cause the Trust to be taxable as an association or
publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation or provided the Trust
indemnification satisfactory to the Owner Trustee with respect to any such tax
or other expense that might be imposed on or incurred by the Trust as a result
of such action.

accordance with this  Section 5.2 . The Owner Trustee and each Paying
Agent with respect to the Certificate is hereby authorized and directed to
retain (as directed in writing by the Administrator) from amounts otherwise
distributable to the holder of the Certificate, sufficient funds for the
payment of any such withholding tax that is legally owed by the Trust (but such
authorization shall not prevent the Trust from contesting any such tax in
appropriate proceedings, and withholding payment of such tax, if permitted by
law, pending the outcome of such proceedings). The amount of any withholding
tax imposed with respect to the holder of the Certificate shall be treated as
cash distributed to the holder of the Certificate at the time it is withheld by
the Trust and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. If there is a
possibility that withholding tax is payable with respect to a distribution, the
Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificate may, in its
sole discretion, withhold such amounts in accordance with this  Section 5.2 .
If the holder of the Certificate wishes to apply for a refund of any such
withholding tax, the Owner Trustee shall reasonably cooperate with the holder
of the Certificate in making such claim so long as the holder of the
Certificate agrees to reimburse the Owner Trustee, as such and in its
individual capacity, for any expenses incurred.  

Section
5.3                 Method of Payment   . 

Subject to  Section 9.1(c) , distributions
required to be made to the holder of the Certificate on any Payment Date shall
be made to the holder of the Certificate by wire transfer, in immediately
available funds, to the account (reasonably identified to the Paying Agent in
writing) of the holder of the Certificate at a bank or other entity having
appropriate facilities therefor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the final
distribution in respect of the Certificate (whether on the Final Note Payment
Date or otherwise) will be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the
Certificate at the office of the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificate.  

Section
5.4                 No Segregation of Monies; No Interest   . 

Subject to  Sections 5.1  and  5.2 , monies
received by the Owner Trustee hereunder need not be segregated in any manner

interest thereon.

received, the Owner Trustee shall not be personally liable, on account of such
action or inaction, to any Person. If the Owner Trustee shall not have received

shorter period of time as reasonably may be specified in such notice or may be
necessary under the circumstances) it may, but shall be under no duty to, take
or refrain from taking such action as it shall deem to be in the best interests
of the Depositor and shall have no personal liability to any Person for such
action or inaction.

its successors, assigns, directors, officers, employees, agents and servants

from and against, any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, taxes,
claims, actions and suits, and any and all reasonable costs, expenses and
disbursements (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of any kind and
nature whatsoever (collectively,     Expenses    )
which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Owner
Trustee in its individual capacity, or any other Indemnified Party in any way
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents,
the Owner Trust Estate, the administration of the Owner Trust Estate or the
action or inaction of the Owner Trustee hereunder;  provided ,  however ,

removal of the Owner Trustee and the termination of this Agreement.  

(b)           Any
obligations of the Depositor under this Agreement are obligations solely of the
Depositor and will not constitute a claim against the Depositor to the extent

obligations. In furtherance of and not in derogation of the foregoing, the
Owner Trustee, by entering into or accepting this Agreement, acknowledges and
agrees that it has no right, title or interest in or to the Other Assets of the
Depositor. To the extent that, notwithstanding the agreements and provisions
contained in the preceding sentence, the Owner Trustee either (i) asserts an
interest or claim to, or benefit from, Other Assets, or (ii) is deemed to have
any such interest, claim to, or benefit in or from Other Assets, whether by
operation of law, legal process, pursuant to applicable provisions of
insolvency laws or otherwise (including by virtue of Section 1111(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code or any successor provision having similar effect under the
Bankruptcy Code), then the Owner Trustee further acknowledges and agrees that
any such interest, claim or benefit in or from Other Assets is and will be
expressly subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full, which, under the
terms of the relevant documents relating to the securitization or conveyance of
such Other Assets, are entitled to be paid from, entitled to the benefits of,
or otherwise secured by such Other Assets (whether or not any such entitlement
or security interest is legally perfected or otherwise entitled to a priority
of distributions or application under applicable law, including insolvency
laws, and whether or not asserted against the Depositor), including the payment
of post-petition interest on such other obligations and liabilities. This
subordination agreement will be deemed a subordination agreement within the
meaning of Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Owner Trustee further
acknowledges and agrees that no adequate remedy at law exists for a breach of
this  Section 8.2(b)  and the terms of this  Section 8.2(b)  may be
enforced by an action for specific performance. The provisions of this  Section
8.2(b)  will be for the third party benefit of those entitled to rely
thereon and will survive the termination of this Agreement.

maturity or other liquidation of the last Contract and
the disposition of any amounts received upon liquidation of any property
remaining in the Trust;  provided ,  however , in each case, that the
Policy shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms and returned to

Agreement or the Trust, entitle the Depositor s legal representatives or heirs
to claim an accounting or to take any action or proceeding in any court for a
partition or winding up of all or any part of the Trust or Owner Trust Estate
or otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties
hereto.

Depositor shall not be entitled to revoke or terminate the Trust.  

(c)           Notice
of any dissolution of the Trust, specifying the Payment Date upon which the
Depositor shall surrender the Certificate to the Paying Agent with respect to
the Certificate for payment of the final distribution and cancellation, shall
be given by the Owner Trustee by letter to the Depositor mailed within five (5)
Business Days of receipt by the Owner Trustee of written notice of such
dissolution from the Servicer, stating (i) the Payment Date upon or with
respect to which final payment of the Certificate shall be made upon
presentation and surrender of the Certificate at the office of the Paying Agent
therein specified, (ii) the amount of any such final payment and (iii) that the
Record Date otherwise applicable to such Payment Date is not applicable,
payments being made only upon presentation and surrender of the Certificate at
the office of the Paying Agent therein specified. The Owner Trustee shall give
such notice to the Certificate Registrar (if other than the Owner Trustee) and
the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificate at the time such notice is
given to the Depositor. Upon presentation and surrender of the Certificate, the
Paying Agent with respect to the Certificate shall cause to be distributed to
the Depositor amounts distributable on such Payment Date pursuant to  Section
5.2 . In the event that the Depositor shall not surrender the Certificate
for cancellation within six (6) months after the date specified in the above
mentioned written notice, the Owner Trustee shall give a second written notice
to the Depositor to surrender the Certificate for cancellation and receive the
final distribution with respect thereto. If within one year after the second
notice the Certificate shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the
Owner Trustee may take appropriate steps, or may appoint an agent to take
appropriate steps, to contact the Depositor concerning surrender of the
Certificate and the cost thereof shall be paid out of the funds and other
assets that shall remain subject to this Agreement. Subject to applicable
escheat laws, any funds remaining in the Trust after exhaustion of such
remedies shall be distributed by the Paying Agent with respect to the
Certificate to the holder of the Certificate.  

(d)           Upon
the completion of the winding up of the Trust, the Owner Trustee, at the
written direction of the Administrator, shall cause the Certificate of Trust to

The Owner Trustee shall at all times (a) be a Person
satisfying the provisions of Section 3807(a) of the Statutory Trust Act, (b) be
authorized to exercise corporate trust powers, (c) have or have a parent that
has a combined capital, surplus and undivided profits of at least $50,000,000 and
be subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authorities and
(d) have (or have a parent that has) a long-term debt rating of investment
grade by each of the Rating Agencies or otherwise be acceptable to each of the
Rating Agencies and the Insurer (provided that no Insurer Default shall have
occurred and be continuing). If such Person shall publish reports of condition
at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid
supervising or examining authority, then for the purpose of this  Section
10.1  the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be
its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of
condition so published. If at any time the Owner Trustee shall cease to be
eligible in accordance with the provisions of this  Section 10.1 , the
Owner Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect
specified in  Section 10.2 .  

Section
10.2              Resignation or Removal of Owner Trustee   . 

The Owner Trustee may at any time resign and be
discharged from the trusts hereby created by giving written notice thereof to
the Administrator and the Insurer. Upon receiving such notice of resignation,
the Administrator shall promptly appoint a successor Owner Trustee, with the
consent of the Insurer, by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which
instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Owner Trustee and one copy to
the successor Owner Trustee. If no successor Owner Trustee shall have been so
appointed and have accepted appointment within thirty (30) days after the
giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Owner Trustee may petition
any court of competent jurisdiction at the expense of the Administrator for the
appointment of a successor Owner Trustee.  

If at any time the Owner Trustee shall cease to be
eligible in accordance with the provisions of  Section 10.1  and shall
fail to resign after written request therefor by the Administrator, or if at
any time the Owner Trustee shall be legally unable to act, or shall be adjudged
bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the Owner Trustee or of its property
shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the
Owner Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation,
conservation or liquidation, then the Administrator may remove the Owner
Trustee. If the Administrator shall remove the Owner Trustee under the
authority of the immediately preceding sentence, the Administrator shall
promptly appoint a successor Owner Trustee, with the consent of the Insurer, by
written  

25  

instrument, in duplicate,
one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the removed Owner Trustee
and one copy to the successor Owner Trustee.  

Any resignation or removal of the Owner Trustee and
appointment of a successor Owner Trustee pursuant to this  Section 10.2 
shall not become effective until either (a) acceptance of appointment by the
successor Owner Trustee pursuant to  Section 10.3  and payment of all
amounts owed to the outgoing Owner Trustee in its individual capacity or (b)
the Trust has been dissolved pursuant to  Section 9.1  hereof and all
amounts received, if any, in connection with the liquidation of the Trust shall
have been distributed to the Noteholders and the Depositor and all amounts
owing to the Insurer have been paid. The Administrator shall provide notice of
such resignation or removal of the Owner Trustee to the Indenture Trustee, the
Depositor, the Noteholders and each of the Rating Agencies.  

Section
10.3              Successor Owner Trustee   . 

Any successor Owner Trustee appointed pursuant to  Section
10.2  shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Administrator and to its
predecessor Owner Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment under this
Agreement, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor Owner
Trustee shall become effective and such successor Owner Trustee, without any
further act, deed or conveyance, shall become fully vested with all the rights,
powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor under this Agreement, with
like effect as if originally named as Owner Trustee. The predecessor Owner
Trustee shall, upon payment of amounts owing to it in its individual capacity,
deliver to the successor Owner Trustee all documents, statements and monies
held by it under this Agreement, and the Administrator and the predecessor
Owner Trustee shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such other
things as may reasonably be required for fully and certainly vesting and
confirming in the successor Owner Trustee all such rights, powers, duties and
obligations.  

No successor Owner Trustee shall accept appointment as
provided in this  Section 10.3  unless, at the time of such acceptance,
such successor Owner Trustee shall be eligible pursuant to  Section 10.1 .  

Any successor Owner Trustee appointed pursuant to this
 Section 10.3  shall file an amendment to the Certificate of Trust with
the Secretary of State reflecting the name and principal place of business of
such successor in the State of Delaware.  

Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor Owner
Trustee pursuant to this  Section 10.3 , the Administrator shall mail
notice of such appointment to the Depositor, the Indenture Trustee, the
Noteholders and the Rating Agencies. If the Administrator shall fail to mail
such notice within ten (10) days after acceptance of appointment by the
successor Owner Trustee, the successor Owner Trustee shall cause such notice to
be mailed at the expense of the Administrator.  

Section
10.4              Merger or Consolidation of Owner Trustee   . 

(a)           If
the Owner Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all
or substantially all its corporate trust business or assets to, another Person,
the resulting, surviving or transferee Person without any further act shall be
the successor Owner  

26  

Trustee;  provided ,  however , that such
Person must be otherwise qualified and eligible under  Section 10.1 . The
Owner Trustee shall provide the Rating Agencies and Insurer with prior written
notice of any such transaction.  

(b)           If
at the time such successor or successors by consolidation, merger or conversion
to the Owner Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Agreement, a
Certificate shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor
to the Owner Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any
predecessor trustee and deliver the Certificate so authenticated, and in case
at that time the Certificate shall not have been authenticated, such successor
to the Owner Trustee may authenticate the Certificate either in the name of any
predecessor trustee or in the name of the successor to the Owner Trustee. In
all such cases such certificate shall have the full force which the Certificate
or this Agreement provide that the certificate of the Owner Trustee shall have.  

Section
10.5              Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee   . 

(a)           Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Agreement, at any time, for the purpose of meeting
any legal requirement of any jurisdiction in which any part of the Owner Trust
Estate or any Financed Vehicle may at the time be located, the Administrator
and the Owner Trustee acting jointly shall have the power and authority (with
the consent of the Insurer, provided that no Insurer Default shall have
occurred and be continuing) and may execute and deliver an instrument to
appoint one or more Persons approved by the Owner Trustee to act as co-trustee
or co-trustees, jointly with the Owner Trustee, or separate trustee or separate
trustees, of all or any part of the Owner Trust Estate, and to vest in such
Person or Persons, in such capacity and for the benefit of the Depositor, such
title to the Owner Trust Estate, or any part thereof, and, subject to the other
provisions of this  Section 10.5 , such powers, authority, duties,
obligations, rights and trusts as the Administrator and the Owner Trustee may
consider necessary or desirable. If the Administrator shall not have joined in
such appointment within fifteen (15) days after the receipt by it of a request
to do so, the Owner Trustee alone shall have the power to make such
appointment. No co-trustee or separate trustee under this Agreement shall be
required to meet the terms of eligibility as a successor trustee under  Section
10.1  and no notice of the appointment of any co-trustee or separate trustee
shall be required under  Section 10.3 .  

(b)           Each
separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, be
appointed and act subject to the following provisions and conditions:  

(i)            all
rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed upon the Owner
Trustee shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed by the
Owner Trustee and such separate trustee or co-trustee jointly (it being
understood that such separate trustee or co-trustee shall not be authorized to
act separately without the Owner Trustee joining in such act), except to the
extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or
acts are to be performed the Owner Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified
to perform such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and
obligations (including the holding of title to the Owner Trust Estate or any
portion thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed
singly by such separate trustee or co-trustee, but solely at the direction of
the Owner Trustee;  

27  

(ii)           no
trustee under this Agreement shall be personally liable by reason of any act or
omission of any other trustee under this Agreement; and  

(iii)          the
Administrator and the Owner Trustee acting jointly may at any time accept the
resignation of or remove any separate trustee or co-trustee.  

(c)           Any
notice, request or other writing given to the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to
have been given to each of the then separate trustees and co-trustees as
effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument appointing any
separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and the conditions
of this  Article X . Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon its
acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or
property specified in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the
Owner Trustee or separately, as may be provided therein, subject to all the
provisions of this Agreement, specifically including every provision of this
Agreement relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability of, or affording
protection to, the Owner Trustee. Each such instrument shall be filed with the
Owner Trustee and a copy thereof given to the Administrator.  

(d)           Any
separate trustee or co-trustee may at any time constitute the Owner Trustee,
its agent or attorney-in-fact with full power and authority, to the extent
permitted by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this Agreement on
its behalf and in its name. If any separate trustee or co-trustee shall die,
become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates,
properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the
Owner Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the appointment of a new
or successor trustee.

the interests of any Noteholder and (B) an Opinion of Counsel shall be
furnished to the Indenture Trustee, the Insurer and the Owner Trustee to the
effect that such amendment (1) will not materially adversely affect the federal
or any Applicable Tax State income or franchise taxation of any outstanding
Note or any Noteholder and (2) will not cause the Trust to be an association or

THE HOLDER OF THIS CERTIFICATE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ITS RIGHTS TO RECEIVE DISTRIBUTIONS IN RESPECT OF THIS CERTIFICATE ARE
SUBORDINATED TO THE RIGHTS OF THE NOTEHOLDERS AS DESCRIBED IN THE SALE AND
ALLOCATION AGREEMENT AND THE TRUST AGREEMENT.  

It is the intent of the Depositor that, for purposes
of federal income, state and local income tax and any other income taxes, the
Trust will not be treated as an association or publicly traded partnership
taxable as a corporation. Any person having an interest in the Certificate by
acceptance of its interest in the Certificate agrees to such treatment and
agrees to take no action inconsistent with such treatment.  

The holder of this Certificate, by its acceptance of
this Certificate or any beneficial interest therein, covenants and agrees and shall
be deemed to covenant and agree that it will not at any time institute against
or knowingly or intentionally cooperate or encourage any other Person in
instituting against the Trust, or join in any institution against the Trust,
any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation
proceedings, or other proceedings under any United States federal or state
bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations relating to the
Notes, the Trust Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents (as
defined in the Trust Agreement).  

Distributions on this Certificate will be made as
provided in the Trust Agreement by the Paying Agent by wire transfer or check
mailed to the holder of this Certificate without the  

A-2  

presentation or surrender of this Certificate or the
making of any notation hereon. Except as otherwise provided in the Trust
Agreement and notwithstanding the above, the final distribution on this
Certificate will be made after due notice by the Owner Trustee of the pendency
of such distribution and only upon presentation and surrender of this
Certificate at the office or agency maintained for the purpose by the Paying
Agent.  

Unless the certificate of authentication hereon shall
have been executed by an authorized officer of the Owner Trustee, or its
authenticating agent by manual signature, this Certificate shall not entitle
the holder of this Certificate to any benefit under the Trust Agreement or the
Sale and Allocation Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

temporary Class A Notes that are printed, lithographed, typewritten,
mimeographed or otherwise produced of the tenor of the Definitive Notes in lieu
of which they are issued and with such variations not inconsistent with the
terms of this Indenture as the officers executing such Class A Notes may
determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Notes.  

10  

(b)           If
temporary Class A Notes are issued, the Issuer shall cause Definitive Notes to

After the preparation of Definitive Notes in accordance with  Section
2.13 , the temporary Class A Notes shall be exchangeable for Definitive
Notes upon surrender of the temporary Class A Notes at the office or agency of
the Issuer to be maintained as provided in  Section 3.2 , without charge
to the Class A Holder.  Upon surrender
for cancellation of any one or more temporary Class A Notes, the Issuer shall
execute, and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange
therefor, a like principal amount of Definitive Notes of authorized
denominations.  Until so exchanged, the
temporary Class A Notes shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits

Section 2.4.           Tax Treatment.   

The Issuer has entered into this Indenture, and the
Notes shall be issued, with the intention that, for federal, state and local
income and franchise tax purposes, the Notes shall qualify as indebtedness of
the Issuer secured by the Trust Estate. 
The Issuer, by entering into this Indenture, and each Noteholder, by its
acceptance of a Note (and each Note Owner by its acceptance of an interest in
the applicable Book-Entry Note), agree to treat the Notes as indebtedness of
the Issuer for federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes.  

Section 2.5.           Registration; Registration of Transfer and Exchange.   

(a)           The
Issuer shall cause to be kept a register (the  Note Register ) in which,
subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Issuer shall
provide for the registration of Notes and the registration of transfers of
Notes.  The Indenture Trustee initially
shall be the registrar (the     Note
Registrar    ) for the purpose of registering Notes and transfers
of Notes as herein provided.  Upon any
resignation of any Note Registrar, the Issuer shall promptly appoint a
successor or, if it elects not to make such an appointment, assume the duties
of Note Registrar.  In addition, the
Indenture Trustee hereby accepts its appointment as Certificate Registrar, as
defined in and pursuant to Section 3.4 of the Trust Agreement.  

(b)           If
a Person other than the Indenture Trustee is appointed by the Issuer as Note
Registrar, (i) the Issuer shall give the Indenture Trustee prompt written
notice of the appointment of such Note Registrar and of the location, or any
change in the location, of the Note Register, (ii) the Indenture Trustee shall
have the right to inspect the Note Register at all reasonable times and to
obtain copies thereof and (iii) the Indenture Trustee shall have the right to
rely upon a certificate executed on behalf of the Note Registrar by an
Executive Officer thereof as to the names and addresses of the Noteholders and
the principal amounts and number of such Notes.  

(c)           Upon
surrender for registration of transfer of any Note at the office or agency of
the Issuer to be maintained as provided in  Section 3.2 , if the requirements
of Section 8-401 of the Relevant UCC are met, the Issuer shall execute, and the
Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Noteholder making such
surrender, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more
new Notes in any authorized denomination, of a like aggregate principal
amount.  The Indenture Trustee may rely
upon the Administrator with respect to the determination of whether the
requirements of Section 8-401 of the Relevant UCC are met.  

11  

(d)           At
the option of the Noteholder, Notes may be exchanged for other Notes of the
same class in any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal
amount, upon surrender of the Notes to be exchanged at such office or
agency.  Whenever any Notes are so
surrendered for exchange, if the requirements of Section 8-401 the Relevant UCC
are met, the Issuer shall execute, and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate
and deliver to the Noteholder making such exchange, the Notes which such
Noteholder is entitled to receive.  The
Indenture Trustee may rely upon the Administrator with respect to the
determination of whether the requirements of Section 8-401 of the Relevant UCC
are met.  

(e)           All
Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes shall be
the valid obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to
the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Notes surrendered upon such
registration of transfer or exchange.  

(f)            All
Notes presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall
be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in
the form of the Assignment attached to  Exhibits A-1 ,  A-2 ,  A-3 ,
 A-4  or  B , as the case may be, satisfactory to the Indenture
Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or such Holder s attorney duly
authorized in writing, with such signature guaranteed by an  eligible guarantor
institution  meeting the requirements of the Note Registrar.  

(g)           No
service charge shall be made to a Holder for any registration of transfer or
exchange of Notes, but the Issuer may require payment by such Holder of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in
connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, other than
exchanges pursuant to  Section 2.3  or  9.5  not involving any
transfer.  

(h)           The
Issuer shall not be required to make, and the Note Registrar need not register,
transfers or exchanges of Notes selected for redemption or Notes with respect
to which the due date for any payment will occur within 15 days.  

Section 2.6.            Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Notes .   

(a)           If
(i) any mutilated Note is surrendered to the Indenture Trustee, or the
Indenture Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction,
loss or theft of any Note, and (ii) there is delivered to the Indenture Trustee
such security or indemnity as may be required by it to hold the Issuer and the
Indenture Trustee harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Issuer, the
Note Registrar or the Indenture Trustee that such Note has been acquired by a
protected purchaser, and provided that the requirements of Section 8-405 of the
Relevant UCC are met, the Issuer shall execute and the Indenture Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Note, a replacement Note; provided, however, that if
any such destroyed, lost or stolen Note, but not a mutilated Note, shall have
become or within seven (7) days of the Indenture Trustee s receipt of evidence
to its satisfaction of such destruction, loss or theft shall be due and
payable, or shall have been called for redemption in whole pursuant to  Section
10.1 , instead of issuing a replacement Note, the Issuer may pay such
destroyed, lost or stolen Note when so due or payable or upon the Redemption
Date without surrender thereof.  The
Indenture Trustee may rely upon the Administrator with respect to the determination
of whether the requirements of Section 8-405 of the Relevant UCC  

12  

are met.  If,
after the delivery of such replacement Note or payment of a destroyed, lost or
stolen Note pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, a protected
purchaser of the original Note in lieu of which such replacement Note was
issued presents for payment such original Note, the Issuer and the Indenture
Trustee shall be entitled to recover such replacement Note (or such payment)
from the Person to whom such replacement Note was delivered or any Person
taking such replacement Note from such Person to whom such replacement Note was
delivered or any assignee of such Person, except a protected purchaser, and
shall be entitled to recover upon the security or indemnity provided therefor
to the extent of any loss, damage, cost or expense incurred by the Issuer or
the Indenture Trustee in connection therewith.  

(b)           Upon
the issuance of any replacement Note under this  Section 2.6 , the Issuer
may require the payment by the Holder of such Note of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with
such issuance and any other reasonable expenses (including the fees and
expenses of the Indenture Trustee) related thereto.  

(c)           Every
replacement Note issued pursuant to this  Section 2.6  in replacement of
any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original
additional contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and
shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and
proportionately with any and all other Notes duly issued hereunder.  

(d)           The
provisions of this  Section 2.6  are exclusive and shall preclude (to the
extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or
payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.  

Section 2.7.            Persons Deemed Owners .   

Prior to due presentation of a Note for registration
of transfer, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or
the Indenture Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Note is
registered in the Note Register (as of the day of determination) as the owner
of such Note for the purpose of receiving payments of principal of and interest
on such Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Note
shall be overdue, and none of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or any agent of
the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the
contrary.

16  

the nominee of the
initial Clearing Agency, and no Note Owner thereof shall receive a Definitive

in  Section 2.13 . Unless and until definitive, fully registered Class A
Notes (the     Definitive Notes    )
have been issued to such Note Owners pursuant to Section 2.13:  

(a)           the
provisions of this  Section 2.11  shall be in full force and effect;  

(b)           the
Note Registrar and the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to deal with the

or directions hereunder) as the sole Holder of the Class A Notes, and shall
have no obligation to the Note Owners;

the extent that the provisions of this  Section 2.11  conflict with any
other provisions of this Indenture, the provisions of this Section shall

Agency Participants; and  

(e)           whenever
this Indenture requires or permits actions to be taken based upon instructions
or directions of Noteholders evidencing a specified percentage of the Class A
Note Balance, the Clearing Agency shall be deemed to represent such percentage
only to the extent that it has received instructions to such effect from Note
Owners and/or Clearing Agency Participants owning or representing,
respectively, such required percentage of the beneficial interest in the Class
A Notes and has delivered such instructions to the Indenture Trustee.  

Section 2.12.         Notices to Clearing Agency .   

Whenever a notice or other communication to the Class
A Noteholders is required under this Indenture, unless and until Definitive
Notes shall have been issued to such Note Owners pursuant to  Section 2.13 ,
the Indenture Trustee shall give all such notices and communications specified
herein to be given to Class A Noteholders to the Clearing Agency, and shall
have no obligation to such Note Owners.

willing or able to properly discharge its responsibilities with respect to the
Book-Entry Notes and the Indenture Trustee or the Administrator is unable to
locate a qualified successor, (b) the Administrator, at its option, advises the
Indenture Trustee in writing that it elects to terminate the book-entry system
through the Clearing Agency, (c) at any time the Clearing Agency shall no

applicable, is unable to appoint a qualified successor or (d) after the  

17  

occurrence of an
Event of Default or an Event of Servicing Termination, Note Owners of the
Book-Entry Notes representing beneficial interests aggregating not less than
51% of the principal amount of such Notes advise the Indenture Trustee and the
Clearing Agency in writing that the continuation of a book-entry system through
the Clearing Agency is no longer in the best interests of such Note Owners,
then the Clearing Agency shall notify all Note Owners and the Indenture Trustee
of the occurrence of such event and of the availability of Definitive Notes to
Note Owners requesting the same.  Upon
surrender to the Indenture Trustee of the typewritten Note representing the
Book-Entry Notes by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration
instructions, the Issuer shall execute and the Indenture Trustee shall
authenticate the Definitive Notes in accordance with the instructions of the
Clearing Agency.  None of the Issuer, the
Note Registrar or the Indenture Trustee shall be liable for any delay in
delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be
protected in relying on, such instructions. 
Upon the issuance of Definitive Notes, the Indenture Trustee shall
recognize the Holders of the Definitive Notes as Noteholders.  

Section 2.14.         Authenticating Agents .   

The Indenture Trustee may appoint one or more Persons
(each, an     Authenticating Agent    )

authentication of Notes in connection with issuance, transfers and exchanges
under  Sections    2.2 ,  2.3 ,  2.5 ,  2.6  and  2.13 ,
as fully to all intents and purposes as though each such Authenticating Agent
had been expressly authorized by those Sections to authenticate such
Notes.  For all purposes of this
Indenture, the authentication of Notes by an Authenticating Agent pursuant to
this  Section 2.14  shall be deemed to be the authentication of Notes  by
the Indenture Trustee.   

Any corporation into which any Authenticating Agent
may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any
corporation resulting from any merger, consolidation or conversion to which any
Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or
substantially all of the corporate trust business of any Authenticating Agent,
shall be the successor of such Authenticating Agent hereunder, without the
execution or filing of any further act on the part of the parties hereto or
such Authenticating Agent or such successor corporation.  

Any Authenticating Agent may at any time resign by
giving written notice of resignation to the Indenture Trustee and the Owner
Trustee.  The Indenture Trustee may at
any time terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent by giving written
notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent and the Owner Trustee.  Upon receiving such notice of resignation or
upon such a termination, the Indenture Trustee shall appoint a successor Authenticating
Agent and shall give written notice of any such appointment to the Owner
Trustee.  

The Administrator agrees to pay to each Authenticating
Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services.  The provisions of  Sections 2.9  and  6.4 
shall be applicable to any Authenticating Agent.  

Section 2.15.         Restrictions on Transfers of Class A Notes .   

(a)           The
Class A Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act
and no Class A Note or any interest therein may be reoffered, resold, pledged
or otherwise  

18  

transferred except as contemplated by the legend set
forth in  paragraph (d)  below.  Any
resale or other transfer, or attempted resale or other transfer which is not
made in compliance with the restrictions set forth in such legend shall not be
recognized by the Issuer.  Authorization
of the Issuer of a purchase, resale or transfer of a Class A Note will be
granted only if made to a qualified institutional buyer and, in each case, in
accordance with the other requirements applicable to a sale of Class A
Notes.  Each purchaser acknowledges and
is deemed to acknowledge that no representation is made by the Issuer as to the
availability of any exemption under the Securities Act or any state securities
laws for resale of the Class A Notes and that such purchaser may be required to
bear the financial risks of this investment for an indefinite period of time.  

(b)           Each
purchaser and any account for which such purchaser is acquiring the Class A
Notes are  Qualified Institutional Buyers  (as defined in Rule 144A under the
Securities Act).  Each purchaser has such
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Class A Notes, and
each purchaser and any account for which such purchaser is acting are each able
to bear the economic risk of such investment.  

(c)           Each
purchaser, by its acceptance of its Class A Note, acknowledges that the Class A
Notes are being sold to it pursuant to an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act.  No
purchaser is purchasing its Class A Notes with a view to resale, distribute or
dispose of in any other manner thereof in violation of the Securities Act.  Each purchaser has had access to such
financial and other information concerning the Issuer and the Class A Notes as
it deemed necessary or appropriate in order to make an informed investment
decision with respect to such purchase of the Class A Notes, including an
opportunity to ask questions of and request information from the Issuer.  

(d)           Each
Class A Note evidencing Book-Entry Notes and Definitive Notes (and all Class A
Notes issued in exchange therefor or substitution thereof) shall bear a legend
in substantially the following form:  

THIS CLASS A NOTE HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE  SECURITIES ACT ),
OR THE APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE. 
ACCORDINGLY, TRANSFER OF THIS CLASS A NOTE IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN
RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 2.15 OF THE INDENTURE.  BY ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THIS CLASS A NOTE, THE
HOLDER OF THIS CLASS A NOTE IS DEEMED TO REPRESENT TO THE TRUST AND THE
INDENTURE TRUSTEE THAT IT IS A  QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER  AS DEFINED IN
RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND IS ACQUIRING THIS CLASS A NOTE FOR ITS
OWN ACCOUNT (AND NOT FOR THE ACCOUNT OF OTHERS) OR AS A FIDUCIARY OR AGENT FOR
OTHERS (WHICH OTHERS ALSO ARE QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYERS).  

NO SALE, PLEDGE OR OTHER TRANSFER OF THIS CLASS A NOTE
SHALL BE MADE UNLESS SUCH SALE, PLEDGE OR OTHER TRANSFER IS (A) PURSUANT TO AN
EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, (B) FOR SO LONG AS
THE CLASS A NOTES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RESALE PURSUANT TO

the Indenture Trustee as hereinafter provided in this  Article V , either
(i) if the Class A Noteholders accelerated, the Class A Noteholders evidencing
not less than 66 2/3% of the Class A Note Balance (with the prior written
consent of the Insurer if the Insurer Default referred to in clause (b) above
has been cured) or (ii) if the Insurer accelerated, the Insurer, by written

declaration and its consequences if:  

(A)          the Issuer has deposited with the
Indenture Trustee a sum sufficient to pay all principal of and interest on the

nonpayment of the principal of the Class A Notes that has become due solely by
such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in  Section 5.12 .  

No such rescission
shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereto.

an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Insurer may (i) if the
Notes have been accelerated in accordance with  Section 5.2(a)  or  5.2(b)

portion of the Class A Note Balance, plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon

Servicing Agreement;  provided ,  however , that the Insurer shall
fulfill its obligations under the Policy.

Indenture Trustee.   

(a)           If
(i) default is made in the payment of any interest on any Class of Class A
Notes when the same becomes due and payable, and such default continues for a
period of five (5) Business Days, or (ii) default is made in the payment of the
principal of any Class of Class A Notes when the same becomes due and payable,
the Issuer shall pay to the Indenture Trustee, for the benefit of the
applicable Noteholders, the amount then due and payable on such Class of Class

the Issuer shall fail forthwith to pay such amounts upon such demand, the
Indenture Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may with
the written consent of the Insurer (provided that no Insurer Default shall have

Proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute
such Proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against

Insurer by such appropriate Proceedings as the Indenture Trustee shall deem
most effective to protect and enforce such rights, whether for the specific
enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the

there shall be pending, relative to the Issuer or any other obligor upon the
Notes or any Person having or claiming an ownership interest in the Trust
Estate, Proceedings under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other
applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or if
a receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator,
sequestrator or similar official shall have been appointed for or taken
possession of the Issuer or its property or such other obligor or Person, or if
there shall be pending any other comparable judicial Proceedings relative to
the Issuer or any other obligor upon the Notes, or to the creditors or property
of the Issuer or such other obligor, the Indenture Trustee, irrespective of
whether the principal of any Notes shall then be due and payable as therein
expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the
Indenture Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of this
 Section 5.3 , shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such

Trustee such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover reasonable compensation to
the Indenture Trustee and each predecessor Indenture Trustee, and their
respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and all other amounts due and owing
to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to  Section 6.7 .  

(e)           Nothing
herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Indenture Trustee to
authorize or consent to or vote for or accept or adopt on behalf of any
Noteholder any plan of

any Proceedings brought by the Indenture Trustee (and also any Proceedings
involving the interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the
Indenture Trustee shall be a party), the Indenture Trustee shall be held to
represent all the Noteholders, and it shall not be necessary to make any
Noteholder a party to any such Proceedings.

payable on the Class A Notes or under this Indenture with respect thereto,
whether by declaration or otherwise, enforce any judgment obtained, and collect
from the Issuer and any other obligor upon the Notes monies adjudged due;  

(ii)           institute Proceedings from time to
time for the complete or partial foreclosure of this Indenture with respect to
the Trust Estate;  

(iii)          exercise any remedies of a secured

Trustee and the Class A Noteholders; or  

(iv)          sell the Trust Estate or any portion
thereof or rights or interest therein at one or more public or private sales
called and conducted in any manner permitted by law;  

provided   ,  however , that the Indenture
Trustee may not sell or otherwise liquidate the Trust Estate following an Event
of Default unless: (A) if no Insurer Default has occurred and is continuing,
the Insurer so directs or consents thereto; or if an Insurer Default has
occurred, 100% of the Holders of the Class A Notes (excluding Class A Notes
held by the Depositor, the Seller, the Servicer or any of their respective
Affiliates) consent thereto; (B) the proceeds of such sale or liquidation are
sufficient to pay in full the Class A Note Balance and all accrued but unpaid
interest on the outstanding Class A Notes and all amounts due to the Insurer
under the Insurance  

40  

Agreement and the
Policy; (C) if an Insurer Default has occurred and is continuing, the Indenture
Trustee determines that the Trust Estate will not continue to provide
sufficient funds for the payment of principal of and interest on each Class of
Class A Notes as they would have become due if the Class A Notes had not been
declared due and payable, and the Indenture Trustee obtains the consent of the
Class A Noteholders evidencing not less than 66 2/3% of the Class A Note
Balance (excluding Class A Notes held by the Depositor, the Seller, the
Servicer or any of their respective Affiliates), or (D) if no Insurer Default
has occurred or is continuing, the Insurer makes the determination specified in
clause (C) and consents.  In determining
such sufficiency or insufficiency with respect to  clauses (B)  and  (C) 
above, the Indenture Trustee may, but need not, obtain and rely upon an opinion
of an Independent investment banking or accounting firm of national reputation
as to the feasibility of such proposed action and as to the sufficiency of the
Trust Estate for such purpose.  

(b)           (X)
If the Indenture Trustee collects any money or property pursuant to this  Section
5.4  or (Y) if the Notes have been accelerated in accordance with  Section
5.2 , the Indenture Trustee shall, in the case of  clause (X)  from
such money or property, or in the case of clause (Y) from all funds available
to it, pay such amounts in the following order of priority:  

(i)            to the Back-up Servicer, the Indenture
Trustee, the Custodian and the Owner Trustee, in its individual capacity,
respectively, any unpaid or unreimbursed fees and any out-of-pocket expenses
(including, but not limited to, attorneys  fees and transition expenses);  provided 
that such expenses shall not exceed $50,000 in the aggregate per year and
$100,000 in the total aggregate;  

(ii)           to the Servicer, all amounts due to
the Servicer as compensation pursuant to Sections 2.08 and 2.11 of the

the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Class A Notes, to be paid in
accordance with  Section 2.8(f)(i) ;  

(vi)          to the Insurer, any unreimbursed
payments under the Policy plus accrued interest on any such payments at the
rate set forth in the Insurance Agreement and any other amounts due the Insurer
under the Insurance Agreement and the Policy;  

(vii)         to the Servicer (so long as First

Indenture and the other Transaction Documents; and  

(x)            to the Depositor Account any
remaining amounts for distribution in accordance with Section 5.2 of the Trust
Agreement.  

The Indenture
Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Noteholders
pursuant to this  Section 5.4 .  At
least fifteen (15) days before such record date, the Issuer shall mail to each
Noteholder and the Indenture Trustee a notice that states the record date, the
payment date and the amount to be paid.  

(c)           When
the Class A Notes have been paid in full, including all accrued and unpaid
interest owing thereon, all amounts owing the Insurer have been paid in full
and the Policy has been returned for cancellation, the rights of the Class A
Noteholders under this Indenture and any other Transaction Document, including,
without limitation, with rights with respect to the Trust Estate, shall
automatically vest in the Class B Noteholders.  

Section 5.5.            Optional Preservation of the Contracts .   

If the Notes have been declared to be due and payable
under  Section 5.2  following an Event of Default, and such declaration
and its consequences have not been rescinded and annulled, the Indenture
Trustee shall, at the direction of the Insurer (if no Insurer Default has
occurred and is continuing), or at the direction of the Class A Noteholders
evidencing not less than 66 2/3% of the Class A Note Balance (if an Insurer
Default has occurred and is continuing), maintain possession of the Trust
Estate and apply proceeds as if there had been no declaration of acceleration;
provided, however, that the Total Available Funds shall be applied in
accordance with such declaration of acceleration in the manner specified in
Sections 3.5(d), (e), (f) and (g) of the Sale and Allocation Agreement.  It is the desire of the parties hereto and
the Noteholders that there be at all times sufficient funds for the payment of
principal of and, if applicable, interest on the Notes, and the Indenture
Trustee shall take such desire into account when determining whether or not to
maintain possession of the Trust Estate. 
In determining whether to maintain possession of the Trust Estate, the
Indenture Trustee may, but need not, obtain and rely upon an opinion of an
Independent investment banking or accounting firm of national reputation as to
the feasibility of such proposed action and as to the sufficiency of the Trust
Estate for such purpose.  

Section 5.6.            Limitation of Suits .   

No Holder of any Note shall have any right to
institute any Proceeding with respect to this Indenture or for the appointment
of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:  

(a)           such
Holder has previously given written notice to the Indenture Trustee of a
continuing Event of Default;  

(b)           the
Noteholders evidencing not less than 25% of the Class A Note Balance have made
written request to the Indenture Trustee to institute such Proceeding in
respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Indenture Trustee
hereunder;  

42  

(c)           such
Holder or Holders have offered to the Indenture Trustee reasonable indemnity
against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in complying with
such request;  

(d)           the
Indenture Trustee for sixty (60) days after its receipt of such notice, request
and offer of indemnity has failed to institute such Proceedings;  

(e)           no
direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the
Indenture Trustee during such 60-day period by the Noteholders evidencing not
less than 51% of the Class A Note Balance; and  

(f)            an
Insurer Default has occurred and is continuing.  

It is understood and intended that no one or more
Noteholders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by
availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice
the rights of any other Noteholders or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority
or preference over any other Noteholders or to enforce any right under this
Indenture, except in the manner herein provided.  

In the event the Indenture Trustee shall receive
conflicting or inconsistent requests and indemnity from two or more groups of
Noteholders, each evidencing less than 51% of the Class A Note Balance, the
Indenture Trustee in its sole discretion may determine what action, if any,
shall be taken, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture.  

Section 5.7.            Unconditional Rights of Noteholders to Receive
Principal and Interest .   

Notwithstanding any other provisions in this
Indenture, the Holder of any Note shall have the right, which is absolute and
unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and, with respect to the
Class A Notes, interest, if any, on such Note on or after the respective due
dates thereof expressed in such Note or in this Indenture (or, in the case of
redemption, on or after the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the
enforcement of any such payment, and such right shall not be impaired without
the consent of such Holder.  

Section 5.8.            Restoration of Rights and Remedies .   

If the Indenture Trustee, the Insurer or any
Noteholder has instituted any Proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under
this Indenture and such Proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any
reason or has been determined adversely to the Indenture Trustee, the Insurer
or such Noteholder, then and in every such case the Issuer, the Indenture
Trustee, the Insurer and the Noteholders shall, subject to any determination in
such Proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former
positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Indenture
Trustee and the Noteholders shall continue as though no such Proceeding had
been instituted.  

43  

Section 5.9.            Rights and Remedies Cumulative Rights .   

No right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved
to the Indenture Trustee, the Insurer or the Noteholders is intended to be
exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to
the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right
and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or
otherwise.  The assertion or employment
of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the
concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.  

Section 5.10.         Delay or Omission Not a Waiver .   

No delay or omission of the Indenture Trustee, the
Insurer or any Holder of any Note to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon
any Default or Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or
constitute a waiver of any such Default or Event of Default or any acquiescence
therein.  Every right and remedy given by
this  Article V  or by law to the Indenture Trustee, the Insurer or the
Noteholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed
expedient, by the Indenture Trustee, the Insurer or the Noteholders, as the
case may be.  

Section 5.11.         Control by Noteholders.    

The Class A Noteholders evidencing not less than 51%
of the Class A Note Balance shall have the right to direct the time, method and
place of conducting any Proceeding for any remedy available to the Indenture
Trustee with respect to the Notes or exercising any trust or power conferred on
the Indenture Trustee;  provided ,  however , that:  

(a)           such
direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture;  

(b)           subject
to the express terms of  Section 5.4 , any direction to the Indenture
Trustee to sell or liquidate the Trust Estate shall be by the Class A
Noteholders evidencing not less than 100% of the Class A Note Balance;  

(c)           if
the conditions set forth in  Section 5.5  have been satisfied and the
Indenture Trustee elects to retain the Trust Estate pursuant to such section,
then any direction to the Indenture Trustee by the Noteholders evidencing less
than 100% of the Class A Note Balance to sell or liquidate the Trust Estate
shall be of no force and effect;  

(d)           the
Indenture Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Indenture
Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction; and  

(e)           an
Insurer Default shall have occurred and is continuing.  

Notwithstanding the rights of Noteholders set forth in
this  Section 5.11 , subject to  Section 6.1 , the Indenture Trustee
need not take any action that it reasonably believes might involve it in costs,
expenses and liabilities for which it will not be adequately indemnified or
might materially and adversely affect the rights of any Class A Noteholders not
consenting to such action.  

44  

Section 5.12.         Waiver of Past Defaults .   

Prior to the declaration of the acceleration of the
maturity of the Class A Notes as provided in  Section 5.2 , the Insurer
(if no Insurer Default shall have occurred and be continuing) or the
Noteholders evidencing not less than 51% of the Class A Note Balance, with the
consent of the Insurer (if no Insurer Default shall have occurred and be
continuing), may waive any past Default or Event of Default and its
consequences except a Default or Event of Default (a) in the payment of
principal of or interest on any Class of Class A Notes or (b) in respect of a
covenant or provision hereof that cannot be amended, supplemented or modified
without the consent of all the Holders. 
Upon any such waiver, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the Insurer and
the Holders shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder,
respectively, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other
Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereto.  Upon any such waiver, such Default or Event
of Default shall cease to exist and be deemed to have been cured and not to
have occurred, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to
have been cured and not to have occurred, for every purpose of this Indenture,
but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of
Default or impair any right consequent thereto.  

Section 5.13.         Undertaking for Costs .   

All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder
of any Note by such Holder s acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed,
that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement
of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the
Indenture Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Indenture
Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay
the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess
reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys  fees, against any party
litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the
claims or defenses made by such party litigant;  provided ,  however ,
that the provisions of this  Section 5.13  shall not apply to (a) any suit
instituted by the Indenture Trustee, (b) any suit instituted by any Noteholder
or group of Noteholders, in each case holding Notes evidencing in the aggregate
more than 10% of the Class A Note Balance or (c) any suit instituted by any
Noteholder for the enforcement of the payment of principal of or, with respect
to the Class A Notes, interest on any Note on or after the respective due dates
expressed in such Note and in this Indenture (or, in the case of redemption, on
or after the Redemption Date).  

Section 5.14.         Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws .   

The Issuer covenants (to the extent that it may
lawfully do so) that it shall not at any time insist upon, or plead or in any
manner whatsoever, claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or
extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, that may
affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture, and the Issuer (to
the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or
advantage of any such law, and covenants that it shall not hinder, delay or
impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Indenture Trustee, but
will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law
had been enacted.  

45  

Section 5.15.         Action on Notes .   

The Indenture Trustee s right to seek and recover judgment
on the Notes or under this Indenture shall not be affected by the seeking,
obtaining or application of any other relief under or with respect to this
Indenture.  Neither the lien of this
Indenture nor any rights or remedies of the Indenture Trustee or the
Noteholders shall be impaired by the recovery of any judgment by the Indenture
Trustee against the Issuer or by the levy of any execution under such judgment
upon any portion of the Trust Estate or upon any of the assets of the Issuer.  Any money or property collected by the
Indenture Trustee shall be applied in accordance with  Section 5.4(b) .  

Section 5.16.         Performance and Enforcement of Certain Obligations .   

(a)           Promptly
following a request from the Indenture Trustee to do so, and at the Administrator s
expense, the Issuer shall take all such lawful action as the Indenture Trustee
may request to compel or secure the performance and observance by the Servicer
of its obligations to the Issuer under or in connection with the Sale and
Allocation Agreement or by the Seller and the Issuer of each of its obligations
under or in connection with the Servicing Agreement, and to exercise any and
all rights, remedies, powers and privileges lawfully available to the Issuer
under or in connection with the Sale and Allocation Agreement to the extent and
in the manner directed by the Indenture Trustee, including the transmission of
notices of default on the part of the Seller or the Servicer thereunder and the
institution of legal or administrative actions or proceedings to compel or
secure performance by the Seller or the Servicer of each of their obligations
under the Sale and Allocation Agreement.  

(b)           If
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Indenture Trustee may
with prior written consent of the Insurer (provided that no Insurer Default has
occurred and is continuing), and at the direction (which direction shall be in
writing or by telephone (confirmed in writing promptly thereafter)) of the
Class A Noteholders evidencing not less than 66 2/3% of the Class A Note
Balance (with the prior written consent of the Insurer, or, at the direction of
the Insurer, in each case provided that no Insurer Default has occurred and is
continuing) shall, exercise all rights, remedies, powers, privileges and claims
of the Issuer against the Servicer under or in connection with the Sale and
Allocation Agreement or against the Servicer under or in connection with the
Servicing Agreement, including the right or power to take any action to compel
or secure performance or observance by the Seller or the Servicer, as the case
may be, of each of their obligations to the Issuer thereunder and to give any
consent, request, notice, direction, approval, extension or waiver under the
Sale and Allocation Agreement or the Servicing Agreement, as the case may be,
and any right of the Issuer to take such action shall be suspended.

Section 6.7.            Compensation and Indemnity .   

(a)           The
Issuer shall pay to the Indenture Trustee from time to time reasonable
compensation for its services in accordance with Section 3.5(d) of the Sale and
Allocation Agreement and the Indenture Trustee Fee Letter and, to the extent
such amounts are not promptly paid by the Issuer, the Issuer shall cause the
Administrator to pay such amounts in accordance with the Administration
Agreement.  The Indenture Trustee s
compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an
express trust.  The Issuer shall, or
shall cause the Administrator to, reimburse the Indenture Trustee for all
expenses reasonably incurred or made by it, including costs of collection, in
addition to the compensation for its services;  provided ,  however ,
that neither the Issuer nor the Administrator need reimburse the Indenture
Trustee for any expense incurred through the Indenture Trustee s willful
misconduct, negligence, or bad faith. 
Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation and expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Indenture Trustee s agents, counsel,
accountants and experts.  The Issuer
shall, or shall cause the Administrator to, indemnify the Indenture Trustee and
the Custodian against any and all loss, liability or expense (including attorneys 
fees) (collectively, together with the amounts specified as  Losses  in  Section
6A.3(d) , the     Losses    )
incurred by it in connection with the administration of this trust and the
performance of its duties hereunder;  provided ,  however , that
neither the Issuer nor the Administrator need indemnify the Indenture Trustee
or the Custodian for any such loss, liability or expense incurred through the
Indenture Trustee s or Custodian s willful misconduct, negligence, or bad
faith, as applicable.  The Indenture Trustee
or Custodian shall notify the Issuer and the Administrator promptly of any
claim for which it may seek indemnity. 
Any failure by the Indenture Trustee or the Custodian to so notify the
Issuer and the Administrator shall not, however, relieve the Issuer or the
Administrator of its obligations hereunder. 
The Issuer shall, or shall cause the Servicer to, defend any such claim,
and the Indenture Trustee or the Custodian, as applicable, may have separate
counsel and the Issuer shall, or shall cause the Servicer to, pay the fees and
expenses of such counsel. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Losses shall be paid pursuant to this  Section
6.7  by the Issuer solely from amounts in excess of funds necessary to pay
all outstanding interest and principal due to the Noteholders and all other
amounts payable in accordance with the priorities set forth in Section 3.5(d)
of the Sale and Allocation Agreement and shall in any case be nonrecourse as to
the Issuer and, to the extent funds are not so available to pay any Losses when
due and owing, the claims relating thereto shall not constitute a claim (as
defined in Section 101 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code)
against the Issuer but shall continue to accrue.  Each party hereto agrees that the payment of
any claim of any such party in respect of Losses payable by the Issuer shall be
subordinated to the payment in full of all outstanding interest and principal
due to each Class of Class A Noteholders.  

(b)           Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Indenture Trustee and the Custodian will not be liable:  

50  

(i)            for any error of judgment made by it
in good faith unless it is proved that the Indenture Trustee or the Custodian,
as applicable, was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;  

(ii)           for any action it takes or omits to
take in good faith in accordance with directions received by it from the
requisite percentage of Noteholders in accordance with the terms herein or in
the other applicable Transaction Documents; or  

(iii)          for interest on any money received by
the Indenture Trustee except as the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer may agree
in writing.  

(c)           The
Issuer s payment obligations to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this  Section
6.7  shall survive the resignation or removal of the Indenture Trustee and
the discharge of this Indenture.  When
the Indenture Trustee incurs expenses after the occurrence of a Default
specified in  Section 5.1(e)  or  (i)  with respect to the Issuer,
the expenses are intended to constitute expenses of administration under Title
11 of the United States Code or any other applicable federal or state
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

this Indenture and all amounts received, if any, in connection with the payment
and discharge of the Notes have been distributed to the Noteholders.  The Indenture Trustee may resign at any time
by so notifying the Issuer and the Insurer. 
The Insurer, provided an Insurer Default shall not have occurred and be
continuing, or the Noteholders evidencing not less than 51% of the Class A Note
Balance (with the prior written consent of the Insurer (provided that no
Insurer Default has occurred and is continuing)) may remove the Indenture
Trustee without cause by so notifying the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer and
shall appoint a successor Indenture Trustee. 
The Issuer shall remove the Indenture Trustee if:

(B)           an Insolvency Event occurs with
respect to the Indenture Trustee;  

(C)           a receiver or other public officer
takes charge of the Indenture Trustee or its property; or  

(D)          the Indenture Trustee otherwise
becomes incapable of acting.  

If (a) the Indenture Trustee resigns or is removed,
(b) the Class A Noteholders fail to appoint a successor Indenture Trustee acceptable
to the Insurer (provided that no Insurer Default has occurred and is
continuing) following the removal of the Indenture Trustee without cause or (c)
if a vacancy exists in the office of Indenture Trustee for any reason (the
Indenture Trustee in such event being referred to herein as the retiring
Indenture Trustee), the Issuer shall promptly  

51  

appoint a
successor Indenture Trustee acceptable to the Insurer (provided that no Insurer
Default has occurred and is continuing).  

(b)           Any
successor Indenture Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its
appointment to the retiring Indenture Trustee, the Insurer and the Issuer.  Upon delivery of such written acceptance, the
resignation or removal of the retiring Indenture Trustee shall become effective
and the successor Indenture Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and
duties of the Indenture Trustee under this Indenture.  The successor Indenture Trustee shall mail a
notice of its succession to the Noteholders. 
The retiring Indenture Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held
by it as Indenture Trustee to the successor Indenture Trustee.  

(c)           If
a successor Indenture Trustee does not take office within sixty (60) days after
the retiring Indenture Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Indenture
Trustee, the Issuer or the Noteholders evidencing not less than 51% of the
Class A Note Balance may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Indenture Trustee. 
If the Indenture Trustee fails to comply with  Section 6.10 , any
Noteholder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of
the Indenture Trustee and the appointment of a successor Indenture Trustee.  

(d)           Notwithstanding
the replacement of the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this Section 6.8, the
Issuer s and the Administrator s obligations under  Section 6.7  shall
continue for the benefit of the retiring Indenture Trustee.  

Section 6.9.            Successor Indenture Trustee .   

(a)           If
the Indenture Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers
all or substantially all its corporate trust business or assets to, another
corporation or banking association, the resulting, surviving or transferee
corporation or banking association without any further act shall be the
successor Indenture Trustee;  provided ,  however , that such
corporation or banking association must be otherwise qualified and eligible
under  Section 6.10 .  The Indenture
Trustee shall provide the Rating Agencies and the Insurer with prior written
notice of any such transaction.  

(b)           If
at the time such successor or successors by consolidation, merger or conversion
to the Indenture Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture,
any of the Notes shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such
successor to the Indenture Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication
of any predecessor trustee and deliver such Notes so authenticated, and in case
at that time any of the Notes shall not have been authenticated, any such
successor to the Indenture Trustee may authenticate such Notes either in the
name of any predecessor trustee or in the name of the successor to the
Indenture Trustee.  In all such cases
such certificates shall have the full force which the Notes or this Indenture
provide that the certificate of the Indenture Trustee shall have.  

Section 6.10.         Eligibility; Disqualification .   

(a)           Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Indenture, at any time, for the purpose of meeting
any legal requirement of any jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Estate
may at the time be located, the Indenture Trustee shall have the power and may
execute  

52  

and deliver an instrument to appoint one or more Persons
to act as a co-trustee or co-trustees, jointly with the Indenture Trustee, or
separate trustee or separate trustees, of all or any part of the Trust Estate,
and to vest in such Person or Persons, in such capacity and for the benefit of
the Noteholders, such title to the Trust Estate, or any part hereof, and,

appointed and act subject to the following provisions and conditions:  

(i)            all rights, powers, duties and
obligations conferred or imposed upon the Indenture Trustee shall be conferred
or imposed upon and exercised or performed by the Indenture Trustee and such
separate trustee or co-trustee jointly (it being understood that such separate
trustee or co-trustee shall not be authorized to act separately without the
Indenture Trustee joining in such act), except to the extent that under any law
of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be performed the
Indenture Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or
acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations (including the
holding of title to the Trust Estate or any portion thereof in any such
jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed singly by such separate trustee
or co-trustee, but solely at the direction of the Indenture Trustee;  

(ii)           no trustee under this Indenture shall
be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of any other trustee
under this Indenture; and  

(iii)          the Indenture Trustee may at any time
accept the resignation of or remove any separate trustee or co-trustee.  

(c)           Any
notice, request or other writing given to the Indenture Trustee shall be deemed

refer to this Indenture and the conditions of this  Article VI .  Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon
its acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or
property specified in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the
Indenture Trustee or separately, as may be provided therein, subject to all the
provisions of this Indenture, specifically including every provision of this
Indenture relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability of, or affording

its agent or attorney-in-fact with full power and authority, to the extent
permitted by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this Indenture on
its behalf and in its name.  If any
separate trustee or co-trustee shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or
be removed, all of its estates, properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall
vest in and be exercised by the Indenture Trustee, to the extent permitted by
law, without the appointment of a new or successor trustee.

(f)            The
duties and responsibilities of the Custodian hereunder shall be determined
solely by the express provisions of this Indenture, and no other or further
duties or responsibilities shall be implied.

(j)            Anything
in this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the

or the Issuer, make any appropriate claim under such bond or insurance; and
(ii) to the extent of the Indenture Trustee s or the Issuer s losses or
damages, pay the proceeds thereof to the Indenture Trustee, or if all of the
Issuer s obligations under this Indenture and the Notes and the Insurance
Agreement have been paid in full, to the Issuer, unless the Custodian has
replaced the lost or destroyed items or has otherwise reimbursed the Indenture
Trustee or the Issuer, as applicable, for such losses or damages.  The Custodian shall maintain the Contract

all Contract Files in the Custodian s possession, whether such right of offset
arises by contract, operation of law or otherwise.  

(o)           The
Custodian specifically acknowledges and agrees that so long as Wells Fargo
Bank, National Association, is acting as Custodian under this Indenture in the
event that Wells Fargo Bank, National Association shall either be terminated or

the successor Custodian may reasonably designate.  Any entity acting as Custodian hereunder may
not resign as such unless such entity also resigns its capacity as Indenture Trustee.

action which would or would be likely to impair the security interests created
or existing under any Contract or Financed Vehicle or to impair the value of

certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more other
such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify or give an
opinion as to such matters in one or several documents.  

(b)           Any
certificate or opinion of an Authorized Officer of the Issuer may be based,
insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or
representations by, counsel, unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of
reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations
with respect to the matters upon which such Issuer s Certificate or opinion is
based are erroneous.  Any such
certificate of an Authorized Officer or Opinion of Counsel may be based,
insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or
representations by, one or more officers of the Servicer, the Seller, the
Administrator or the Issuer, stating that the information with respect to such
factual matters is in the possession of the Servicer, the Seller, the
Administrator or the Issuer, unless such Authorized Officer or counsel knows,
or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or
opinion or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous.  

(c)           Where
any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications,
requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other instruments
under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one
instrument.  

(d)           Whenever
in this Indenture, in connection with any application or certificate or report
to the Indenture Trustee, it is provided that the Issuer shall deliver any
document as a condition of the granting of such application, or as evidence of
the Issuer s compliance with any term hereof, it is intended that the truth and
accuracy, at the time of the granting of such application or at the effective
date of such certificate or report (as the case may be), of the facts and
opinions stated in such document shall in such case be conditions precedent to
the right of the Issuer to have such application granted or to the sufficiency
of such certificate or report.  The
foregoing shall not, however, be construed to affect the Indenture Trustee s
right to rely upon the  

68  

truth and accuracy of any statement or opinion
contained in any such document as provided in Article VI.

similar tenor signed by the Noteholders in person or by agents duly appointed
in writing, and except as herein otherwise expressly provided such action shall
become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the
Indenture Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the
Issuer.  Such instrument or instruments
(and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes
referred to as the  Act  of the Noteholders signing such instrument or
instruments.  Proof of execution of any
such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient
for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to  Section 6.1 )
conclusive in favor of the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer, if made in the
manner provided in this  Section 11.3 .  

(b)           The
fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing
may be proved in any manner that the Indenture Trustee deems sufficient.

ownership of Notes shall be proved by the Note Register.  

(d)           Any
request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other
action by the Holder of any Notes shall bind the Holder of every Note issued
upon the registration thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof, in
respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Indenture
Trustee or the Issuer in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such
action is made upon such Note.  

Section 11.4.         Notices, etc. to Indenture Trustee .

shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in
writing and mailed, first-class, postage prepaid to each Noteholder affected by
such event, at its address as it appears on the Note Register, not later than
the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the
giving of such notice.  In any case where
notice to Noteholders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice
nor any defect in any notice so mailed to any particular Noteholder shall
affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Noteholders, and
any notice that is mailed in the manner herein provided shall conclusively be
presumed to have been duly given.  

(b)           Where
this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in
writing by any Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after
the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice.  Waivers of notice by Noteholders shall be
filed with the Indenture Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition
precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such a waiver.  

(c)           If,
by reason of the suspension of regular mail service as a result of a strike,
work stoppage or similar activity, it shall be impractical to mail notice of
any event to Noteholders when such notice is required to be given pursuant to
any provision of this Indenture, then any manner of giving such notice as shall
be satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee shall be deemed to be a sufficient
giving of such notice.  

(d)           Where
this Indenture provides for notice to the Rating Agencies, failure to give such
notice shall not affect any other rights or obligations created hereunder, and
shall not under any circumstance constitute a Default or Event of Default.  

Section 11.6.         Alternate Payment and Notice Provisions .

cause payments to be made and notices to be given in accordance with such

If no Insurer Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Insurer shall have the right to exercise all rights, including
voting rights, which the Class A Noteholders are entitled to exercise pursuant
to this Indenture, without any consent of such Class A Noteholders except for

  to Indenture  

Perfection Representations,
Warranties And Covenants   

In addition to the representations, warranties and
covenants contained in the Indenture, the Issuer hereby represents, warrants,
and covenants to the Indenture Trustee as follows on the Closing Date, and on
each Additional Contract Purchase Date, in each case only with respect to the
Collateral pledged to the Indenture Trustee on the Closing Date, or the

General   

1.             The Indenture creates a valid and
continuing security interest (as defined in the Relevant UCC Section 9-102) in
the Collateral in favor of the Indenture Trustee, which security interest is
prior to all other Liens, except as set forth below, and is enforceable as such
as against creditors of and purchasers from and assignees of the Issuer.  

2.             Each Contract constitutes  tangible
chattel paper  and not  electronic chattel paper , within the meaning of the
Relevant UCC Section 9-102.  

3.             The Issuer has taken or will take
all steps necessary actions with respect to the Contracts to perfect the
security interest of the Indenture Trustee in the Contracts.  

Creation   

1.             The Issuer owns and has good and
marketable title to the Collateral, free and clear of any Lien, claim or
encumbrance of any Person, excepting only tax liens, mechanics  liens and other
liens that arise by the operation of law, in each case on any of the Financed
Vehicles and arising solely as a result of an action or omission of the related
Obligor.  

Perfection   

1.             The Issuer has caused the filing of
all appropriate financing statements in the proper filing office in the
appropriate jurisdictions under applicable law in order to perfect the security
interest in the Collateral granted to the Indenture Trustee under the
Indenture.  

2.             With respect to Collateral that
constitutes tangible chattel paper, such tangible chattel paper is in the
possession of the Custodian, and the Issuer has received a written
acknowledgment from the Custodian that it is holding such tangible chattel
paper for the benefit of the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer.  All financing statements filed or to be filed
against the Issuer in favor of the Indenture Trustee in connection with this
Indenture describing the Collateral contain a statement to the following
effect:  A purchase of or security interest in any collateral described in this
financing statement will violate the rights of the Secured Party.   

Priority   

1.             Other than the security interest
granted to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this Indenture, the Issuer has not
pledged, assigned, sold, granted a security interest in, or otherwise conveyed
any of the Collateral.  The Issuer has
not authorized the filing of, or is aware of any financing statements against

the Collateral and proceeds related thereto other than any financing
statement:  (i) relating to the sale of
the Contributed Property by the Seller to the Depositor under the Contribution Agreement;
(ii) relating to the sale of the Trust Property by the Depositor to the Issuer
under the Sale and Allocation Agreement; (iii) relating to the security
interest granted to the Indenture Trustee by the Issuer under the Indenture; or
(iv) that has been terminated or amended to reflect a release of the
Collateral.  

2.             The Issuer is not aware of any
judgment, ERISA or tax lien filings against either the Seller, the Depositor or
the Issuer.  

3.             None of the tangible chattel paper
that constitutes or evidences the Contracts has any marks or notations
indicating that it has been pledged, assigned or otherwise conveyed to any
Person other than the Seller, the Depositor, the Issuer or the Indenture
Trustee.

of this Indenture, the Contribution Agreement, the Sale and Allocation
Agreement or any other Transaction Document, the Perfection Representations,

the Issuer with the consent of the Noteholders evidencing not less than 51% of
the Class A Note Balance (subject to the right of the Insurer to exercise such
consent provided that no Insurer Default shall have occurred and be continuing).  The Indenture also permits the Indenture
Trustee and the Issuer to enter into supplemental indentures with respect to
certain terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture without the consent of
Holders of the Class A Notes issued thereunder.  

The term  Issuer,  as used
in this Class A-3 Note, includes any successor to the Issuer under the
Indenture.  

The Class A-3 Notes are
issuable only in registered form in denominations as provided in the Indenture,
subject to certain limitations therein set forth.  

This Class A-3 Note and the
Indenture shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of New York, without reference to its conflict of law provisions, and
the obligations, rights and remedies of the parties hereunder and thereunder
shall be determined in accordance with such laws.

shall be personally liable for, nor shall recourse be had to any of them for,
the payment of principal or of interest on this Class A-3 Note or performance
of, or omission to perform, any of the covenants, obligations or
indemnifications contained in the Indenture. 
The Holder of this Class A-3 Note, by its acceptance hereof (and each
Note Owner, by its acceptance of a beneficial interest herein), agrees that,
except as expressly provided in the Transaction Documents, in the case of an
Event of Default under the Indenture, the Holder shall have no claim against
any of the foregoing for any deficiency, loss or claim therefrom;  provided ,
 however , that nothing contained herein shall be taken to prevent
recourse to, and enforcement against, the assets of the Issuer for any and all

the Additional Purchase Price for such Additional Contracts from the Prefunding
Account to such account as the Trust, through the Servicer, may specify.

the Insurer in the manner set forth in  Article III  of this
Agreement.  

Section 5.17.         Subordination .   

Any obligations of the Depositor under this
Agreement are obligations solely of the Depositor and will not constitute a
claim against the Depositor to the extent that the Depositor does not have
funds sufficient to make payment of such obligations.  In furtherance of and not in derogation of
the foregoing, each party to this Agreement, by entering into or accepting this
Agreement, acknowledges and agrees that it has no right, title or interest in
or to the Other Assets of the Depositor. 
To the extent that, notwithstanding the agreements and provisions
contained in the preceding sentence, any party to this Agreement either (i) asserts
an interest or claim to, or benefit from, Other Assets, or (ii) is deemed
to have any such interest, claim to, or benefit in or from Other Assets,
whether by operation of law, legal process, pursuant to applicable provisions of
insolvency laws or otherwise (including by virtue of Section 1111(b) of
the Bankruptcy Code or any successor provision having similar effect under the
Bankruptcy Code), then such party further acknowledges and agrees that any such
interest, claim or benefit in or from Other Assets is and will be expressly
subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full, which, under the terms of the
relevant documents relating to the securitization or conveyance of such Other
Assets, are entitled to be paid from, entitled to the benefits of, or otherwise
secured by such Other Assets (whether or not any such entitlement or security
interest is legally perfected or otherwise entitled to a priority of
distributions or application under applicable law, including insolvency laws,
and whether or not asserted against the Depositor), including the payment of
post-petition interest on such other obligations and liabilities.  This subordination provision will be deemed a
subordination provision within the meaning of Section 510(a) of the
Bankruptcy Code.  Each party to this
Agreement further acknowledges and agrees that no adequate remedy at law exists
for a breach of this  Section 5.17  and the terms of this  Section 5.17 
may be enforced by an action for specific performance.  The provisions of this  Section 5.17 
will be for the third party benefit of those entitled to rely thereon and will
survive the termination of this Agreement.

Perfection
Representations, Warranties and Covenants  

In addition to the representations, warranties
and covenants contained in this Agreement, the Depositor hereby represents,
warrants, and covenants to the Trust as follows on the Closing Date and on each
Additional Contract Purchase Date on which the Trust purchases Contracts, in
each case only with respect to the Collateral sold to the Trust on the Closing
Date or the relevant Additional Contract Purchase Date, as applicable:  

General   

1.             The Agreement creates a valid and
continuing security interest (as defined in the Relevant UCC Section 9-102)
in the Collateral in favor of the Trust, which security interest is prior to
all other Liens, except as set forth below and is enforceable as such against
creditors of and purchasers from and assignees of the Trust.  

2.             Each Contract constitutes  tangible
chattel paper  and not  electronic chattel paper  within the meaning of the
Relevant UCC Section 9-102.  

3.             The Depositor has taken or will
take all steps necessary actions with respect to the Contracts to perfect the
security interest of the Trust in the Contracts.  

Creation   

1.             The Depositor owns and has good and
marketable title to the Collateral, free and clear of any Lien, claim or
encumbrance of any Person, excepting only tax liens, some mechanics  liens and
other liens that arise by the operation of law, in each case on any of the
Financed Vehicles and arising solely as a result of an action or omission of
the related Obligor.  

Perfection   

1.             The Depositor has caused the filing
of all appropriate financing statements in the proper filing office in the
appropriate jurisdictions under applicable law in order to perfect the security
interest in the Collateral granted to the Trust hereunder.  

2.             With respect to Collateral that
constitutes tangible chattel paper, such tangible chattel paper is in the
possession of the Custodian.  All
financing statements filed or to be filed against the Depositor in favor of the
Trust in connection with this Agreement describing the Collateral contain a
statement to the following effect:  A purchase of or security interest in any
collateral described in this financing statement will violate the rights of the
Secured Party.   

Priority   

1.             Other than the security interest
granted to the Trust pursuant to this Agreement, the Depositor has not pledged,
assigned, sold, granted a security interest in, or otherwise conveyed   

Schedule 3-1  

any of the Collateral.  Neither the Seller nor the Depositor has
authorized the filing of, or is aware of any financing statements against
either the Seller or the Depositor that includes a description of the Collateral
and proceeds related thereto other than any financing statement:  (i) relating to the transfer of the
Contracts by the Seller to the Depositor under the Contribution Agreement; (ii) relating
to the sale of the Contracts by the Depositor to the Trust under this
Agreement; (iii) relating to the security interest granted to the
Indenture Trustee by the Trust under the Indenture; or (iv) that has been
terminated or amended to reflect a release of the Collateral.  

2.             Neither the Seller nor the
Depositor is aware of any judgment, ERISA or tax lien filings against either
the Seller or the Depositor.  

3.             None of the tangible chattel paper
that constitutes or evidences the Contracts has any marks or notations
indicating that it has been pledged, assigned or otherwise conveyed to any
Person other than the Depositor, the Trust or the Indenture Trustee.  

Survival of Perfection
Representations   

1.             Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, the Contribution Agreement, the Indenture or any other
Transaction Document, the Perfection Representations, Warranties and Covenants
contained in this Schedule shall be continuing, and remain in full force
and effect until such time as all obligations under this Sale and Allocation
Agreement, the Contribution Agreement and the Indenture have been finally and
fully paid and performed.  

No Waiver   

1.             The parties hereto: (i) shall
not, without obtaining a confirmation of the then-current rating of the Class A
Notes (without giving effect to the Policy), waive any of the Perfection
Representations, Warranties or Covenants; (ii) shall provide the Rating
Agencies with prompt written notice of any breach of the Perfection
Representations, Warranties or Covenants, and shall not, without obtaining a
confirmation of the then-current rating of the Class A Notes (without
giving effect to the Policy) as determined after any adjustment or withdrawal
of the ratings following notice of such breach) waive a breach of any of the

represent, warrant and covenant as of the Date of Issuance, each as to those

(a)             Due Organization and
Qualification  .  Each of the

in good standing and has obtained all licenses, permits, charters,
registrations and approvals (together,  approvals ) necessary for the conduct
of its business as currently conducted and as described in the Offering
Document and the performance of its obligations under the Transaction
Documents, in each jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified or to
obtain such approvals would render any Transaction Document unenforceable in
any respect or would have a material adverse effect upon the Transaction, the
Owners or the Insurer.  

6  

(b)             Power and Authority  .  Each of the Servicer, the Seller and the
Depositor has all necessary corporate power and authority to conduct its
business as currently conducted and, as described in the Offering Document, to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents
and to consummate the Transaction.  

(c)             Due Authorization  .  The execution, delivery and performance of
the Transaction Documents by the Servicer, the Seller and the Depositor have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and do not require any
additional approvals or consents of, or other action by or any notice to or
filing with any Person, including, without limitation, any governmental entity
or the Servicer s, the Seller s or the Depositor s stockholders, which have not
previously been obtained or given by the Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor.  

(d)             Noncontravention  .  None of the execution and delivery of the
Transaction Documents by the Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor, the
consummation of the Transaction contemplated thereby or the satisfaction of the
terms and conditions of the Transaction Documents:  

(i)            conflicts with or results in any
breach or violation of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of the Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor or any law, rule,
regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award
currently in effect having applicability to the Servicer, the Seller or the
Depositor or any of their material properties, including regulations issued by
an administrative agency or other governmental authority having supervisory powers
over the Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor;  

(ii)           constitutes a default by the
Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor under or a breach of any provision of any
loan agreement, mortgage, indenture or other agreement or instrument to which
the Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor is a party or by which any of its or
their respective properties, which 
individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on
the Transaction; or  

(iii)          results in or requires the creation of
any lien upon or in respect of any assets of the Servicer, the Seller or the
Depositor, except as contemplated by the Transaction Documents.  

(e)             Legal Proceedings  .  There is no action, proceeding or
investigation by or before any court, governmental or administrative agency or
arbitrator against or affecting the Servicer, the Seller, the Depositor or any
of its or their subsidiaries, or any properties or rights of the Servicer, the
Seller, the Depositor or any of its or their subsidiaries, pending or, to the
Servicer s, the Seller s or the Depositor s knowledge after reasonable inquiry,
threatened, which, in any case, could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Change with respect to the Servicer, the Seller or the
Depositor.  

(f)              Valid and Binding Obligations  .  The Obligations, when executed, authenticated
and issued in accordance with the Indenture, and the Transaction  

7  

Documents
(other than the Obligations), when executed and delivered by the Servicer, the
Seller and the Depositor, will constitute the legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Servicer, the Seller, the Depositor and the Trust, as
applicable, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as
such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors  rights generally and
general equitable principles and public policy considerations as to rights of
indemnification for violations of federal securities laws.  None of the Servicer, the Seller or the
Depositor will at any time in the future deny that the Transaction Documents
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Servicer, the
Seller, the Depositor or the Trust, as applicable.  

(g)             Financial Statements  .  The Financial Statements of FIFSG, copies of
which have been furnished to the Insurer, (i) are, as of the dates and for
the periods referred to therein, complete and correct in all material respects,
(ii) present fairly the financial condition and results of operations of
the companies reported therein as of the dates and for the periods indicated
and (iii) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied, except as noted therein (subject as
to interim statements to normal year-end adjustments).  Since the date of the most recent Financial
Statements, there has been no Material Adverse Change in respect of the
Servicer or the Seller.  Except as
disclosed in the Financial Statements, the Servicer and the Seller are not
subject to any contingent liabilities or commitments that, individually or in
the aggregate, have a material possibility of causing a Material Adverse Change
in respect of the Servicer or the Seller.  

(h)             Compliance With Law, Etc  .  No practice, procedure or policy employed, or
proposed to be employed, by the Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor in the
conduct of its business violates any law, regulation, judgment, agreement,
order or decree applicable to any of them that, if enforced, could reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change with respect to the
Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor. 
None of the Servicer, the Seller and the Depositor is in breach of or in
default under any applicable law or administrative regulation of its respective
jurisdiction of incorporation, or any department, division, agency or
instrumentality thereof or of the United States or any applicable judgment
or decree or any loan agreement, note, resolution, certificate, agreement or
other instrument to which the Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor is a party
or is otherwise subject which, if enforced, would have a material adverse
effect on the ability of the Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor, as the case
may be, to perform its respective obligations under the Transaction Documents.  

(i)              Taxes  .  The Servicer, the Seller and the Depositor
and the Servicer s, the Seller s and the Depositor s parent company or
companies have filed prior to the date hereof all federal and state tax returns
that are required to be filed and paid all taxes, including any assessments
received by them that are not being contested in good faith, to the extent that
such taxes have become due, except for any failures to file or pay that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not result in a Material Adverse Change
with respect to the Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor.  

8  

(j)              Accuracy of Information  .  Neither the Transaction Documents, nor other
information relating to the Contracts, the operations of the Servicer, the
Seller or the Depositor (including servicing or origination of loans) or the
financial condition of the Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor (collectively,
the  Documents ), as amended, supplemented or superseded, furnished to the
Insurer by the Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor contains any statement of
a material fact by the Servicer, the Seller or Depositor which was untrue or
misleading in any material respect when made. 
None of the Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor has any knowledge of
circumstances that could reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse
Change with respect to the Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor.  Since the furnishing of the Documents, there
has been no change or any development or event involving a prospective change
known to the Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor that would render any of the
Documents untrue or misleading in any material respect.  

(k)             Compliance With Securities
Laws  .  The offer and sale of
the Obligations comply in all material respects with all requirements of law,
including all registration requirements of applicable securities laws.  Without limitation of the foregoing, the
Offering Document does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact and
does not omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; provided, however, that no representation is made with respect to
the information in the Offering Document set forth under the heading  Description
of the Insurer and the Insurance Policy  or the consolidated financial
statements of the Insurer incorporated by reference in the Offering Document;
and provided, further, that no representation is made with respect to the
statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page of the
Offering Document regarding the delivery of the Obligations and the disclosure
under the heading  Plan of Distribution  in the Offering Document.  Neither the offer nor the sale of the
Obligations has been or will be in violation of the Securities Act or any other
federal or state securities laws.  The
Issuer is not required to be registered as an  investment company  under the
Investment Company Act.  

(l)              Transaction Documents  .  Each of the representations and warranties of
the Servicer, the Seller and the Depositor contained in the Transaction
Documents is true and correct in all material respects, and each of the
Servicer, the Seller and the Depositor hereby make each such representation and
warranty to, and for the benefit of, the Insurer as if the same were set forth
in full herein.  

(m)            Solvency, Fraudulent
Conveyance  .  The Servicer, the
Seller and the Depositor are solvent and will not be rendered insolvent by the
Transaction and, after giving effect to the Transaction, none of the Servicer,
the Seller or the Depositor will be left with an unreasonably small amount of
capital with which to engage in its business. None of the Servicer, the Seller
or the Depositor intend to incur, or believe that it has incurred, debts beyond
its ability to pay as they mature.  None
of the Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor contemplates the commencement of
insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or consolidation proceedings or the
appointment of a receiver, liquidator, conservator, trustee or similar official
in respect of the Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor or any of  

9  

their
assets.  The amount of consideration
being received by the Issuer upon the sale of the Obligations to the Initial
Purchaser constitutes reasonably equivalent value and fair consideration for
the interest in the Contracts evidenced by the Obligations.  The Seller 
is not transferring the Contracts to the Issuer and the Issuer is not
selling the Obligations to any Initial Purchaser, as provided in the
Transaction Documents, with any intent to hinder, delay or defraud any of the
Seller s or the Depositor s creditors.

Seller or the Depositor under this Section 3.04, notify the Servicer, the

of the commencement thereof, the Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor shall be
entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall wish, to assume

shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless the employment of
counsel by such indemnified party has been authorized by the Servicer, the

expenses of attorneys, consultants and auditors and reasonable costs of
investigations) or obligations whatsoever of any nature arising out of the
breach by the Indenture Trustee of any of its obligations under this Insurance
Agreement or the Indenture.  This
indemnity provision shall survive the termination of this Insurance Agreement
and shall survive until the statute of limitations has run on any causes of
action which arise from one of these reasons and until all suits filed as a
result thereof have been finally concluded.  

(e)           In addition to any and all rights of
indemnification or any other rights of the Insurer pursuant hereto or under law

employees, agents, including each person, if any, who controls the Insurer

of the Securities Exchange Act from and against any and all claims, losses,
liabilities (including penalties), actions, suits, judgments, demands, damages,
costs or reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees
and expenses of attorneys, consultants and auditors and reasonable costs of
investigations) or obligations whatsoever of any nature arising out of the
breach by the Back-up Servicer of any of its obligations under this Insurance
Agreement or the Servicing Agreement. 
This indemnity provision shall survive the termination of this Insurance
Agreement and shall survive until the statute of limitations has run on any
causes of action which arise from one of these reasons and until all suits
filed as a result thereof have been finally concluded.

event of any payment by the Insurer, the Indenture Trustee, the Servicer, the

America in immediately available funds at the notice address for the Insurer as
specified in Section 6.02 hereof on the date when due or as the Insurer
shall otherwise direct by written notice to the other parties hereto.  In the event that the date of any payment to
the Insurer or the expiration of any time period hereunder occurs on a day
which is not a Business Day, then such payment or expiration of time period
shall be made or occur on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force
and effect as if such payment was made or time period expired on the scheduled
date of payment or expiration date. 
Payments to be made to the Insurer under this Insurance Agreement shall
bear interest at the Late Payment Rate from the date when due to the date paid.

entitled to assign or pledge to any bank or other lender providing liquidity or

the Insurer, or in which the Insurer has a security interest, in connection
with the Transaction.  

(d)           Except as provided herein with

insufficient, fraudulent or forged (unless the Insurer shall have actual
knowledge thereof).  In furtherance and
not in limitation of the foregoing, the Insurer (or its Fiscal Agent) may
accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without

(x) with respect to which the Servicer, Depositor, the Seller or any
affiliate thereof (each a  First Investors Company ) is a party (including,
without limitation, an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding in respect of any
First Investors Company) which affects the Trust Estate, the Policy or the
obligations of the Insurer under the Transaction Documents, and (y) with
respect to which such First Investors Company fails to defend or answer, the
Insurer shall have the right to direct, assume or otherwise participate in the
defense thereof (so long as no Insurer Default has occurred and is
continuing).  In such event, the Insurer

exclusive-right to determine, in its sole discretion, the actions necessary to
preserve and protect the Trust Estate. 
All costs and expenses of the Insurer in connection with such action,
proceeding or investigation, (including, without limitation, any judgment or
settlement entered into or paid by the Insurer), shall be included in the
Insurance Payment Amount and shall be payable to the Insurer pursuant to Section 3.5(d)(vi) of

discretion shall direct with respect to such court proceeding.  The Indenture Trustee shall not be liable to
the Insurer for any such action that conforms to the direction of the

Indenture Trustee for such costs and expenses within 60 days of such
nonpayment.  

(d)           The Indenture Trustee hereby agrees

Insurer hereunder or under the Policy or the other Transaction Documents,
including (without limitation) any insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding in
respect of the Servicer, Depositor, the Seller or any affiliate thereof.  

(e)           Notwithstanding anything contained
herein or in any of the other Transaction Documents to the contrary, the
Indenture Trustee shall not, without the Insurer s prior written consent or
unless directed by the Insurer (so long as no Insurer Default has occurred and
is continuing), undertake or join any litigation or agree to any settlement of
any action, proceeding or investigation affecting the Owner Trustee, the Issuer
or the Trust Estate or the rights or obligations of the Insurer hereunder or
under the Policy or the other Transaction Documents.

subrogated to any remedies against the Depositor, the Seller or the Servicer or
in respect of the Contracts available to the Indenture Trustee under the
Indenture or Sale and Allocation Agreement.

to execute such instruments prepared by the Insurer and to take such reasonable
actions as, in the sole judgment of the Insurer, are necessary to evidence such

forth in Section 3.5 of the Sale and Allocation Agreement, and to the
extent such proceeds of the Collateral are insufficient to meet the obligations
of the Issuer hereunder in full, the Issuer shall have no further liability in
respect of any such outstanding obligations, it being agreed between the
parties that, upon realization of the Collateral and its reduction to zero, all
claims arising out of or in connection with this Agreement against the Issuer
shall thereupon extinguish and shall not thereafter revive.  

Section 6.14.        Subordination  .  Any obligations of the Depositor under this
Agreement are obligations solely of the Depositor and will not constitute a
claim against the Depositor to the extent that the Depositor does not have
funds sufficient to make payment of such obligations.  In furtherance of and not in derogation of
the foregoing, the parties hereto (other than the Depositor), by entering into
or accepting this Agreement, each acknowledges and agrees that it has no right,
title, or interest in or to the Other Assets of the Depositor.  To the extent that, notwithstanding the
agreements and provisions contained in the preceding sentence, any party hereto
either (i) asserts an interest or claim to, or benefit from, Other Assets,
or (ii) is deemed to have any such interest, claim to, or benefit in or
from Other Assets, whether by operation of law, legal process, pursuant to
applicable provisions of insolvency laws or otherwise (including by virtue of Section 1111(b) of
the Bankruptcy Code or any successor provision having similar effect under the
Bankruptcy Code), then such party further acknowledges and agrees that any such
interest, claim or benefit in or from Other Assets is and will be expressly
subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full, which, under the terms of the
relevant documents relating to the securitization or conveyance of such Other
Assets, are entitled to be paid from, entitled to the benefits of, or otherwise
secured by such Other Assets (whether or not any such entitlement or security
interest is legally perfected or otherwise entitled to a priority of
distributions or application under applicable law, including insolvency laws,
and whether or not asserted against the Depositor), including the payment of
post-petition interest on such other obligations and liabilities.  This subordination provision will be deemed a
subordination provision within the meaning of Section 510(a) of the
Bankruptcy Code.  Each party hereto
(other than the Depositor) further acknowledges and agrees that no adequate
remedy at law exists for a breach of this Section 6.14 and the terms of
this Section 6.14 may be enforced by an action for specific
performance.  The provisions of this Section 6.14
will be for the third party benefit of those entitled to rely thereon and will
survive the termination of this Agreement.

acting as agent for the Indenture Trustee, and shall be deemed to be holding
such funds in trust on behalf of, and as agent for, the Indenture Trustee.

the Back-up Servicer shall for any reason no longer be acting as such (including

hereof), the Successor Back-up Servicer shall thereupon assume all of the
rights and obligations of the outgoing Back-up Servicer under this Servicing
Agreement. In such event, the Successor Back-up Servicer shall be deemed to
have assumed all of the outgoing Back-up Servicer s interest herein and to have
replaced the outgoing Back-up Servicer as a party to this Servicing Agreement
to the same extent as if this Servicing Agreement had been assigned to the
Successor Back-up Servicer, except that the outgoing Back-up Servicer shall not
thereby be relieved of any liability or obligations on its part under this
Servicing Agreement arising prior to such replacement. The outgoing Back-up
Servicer shall, at the reasonable expense of the Issuer pursuant to the
priority of payments set forth in Section 3.5(d) of the Sale and Allocation
Agreement, deliver to the Successor Back-up Servicer all documents and records
relating to this Servicing Agreement and the Contracts then being serviced
hereunder and an accounting of amounts collected and held by it and otherwise

Servicing Agreement to the Successor Back-up Servicer. Compensation and expense

date that the outgoing Back-up Servicer ceases to render services.  

(f)                The Issuer
shall, at its own expense, duly and punctually perform and observe its obligations
to the Back-up Servicer and the Servicer under this Servicing Agreement in
accordance with the terms hereof. In addition, promptly following a request
from the Indenture Trustee to do so and at the Issuer s own expense, the Issuer
shall take all such lawful action as the Indenture Trustee (which shall so
request if directed by Noteholders evidencing not less than 51% of the Class A
Note Balance, with the consent of the Insurer, to do so) may request to compel
or secure the performance and observance by the Back-up Servicer and the
Servicer of each of its respective obligations to the Issuer under or in
connection with this Servicing Agreement, in accordance with the terms hereof,
and in effecting such request shall exercise any and all rights, remedies,
powers and privileges lawfully available to the Issuer under or in connection
with this Servicing Agreement to the extent and in the manner directed by the
Indenture Trustee, including, without limitation, the transmission of notices
of default on the part of the Back-up Servicer or the Servicer hereunder and
the institution of legal or administrative actions or proceedings to compel or
secure performance by the Back-up Servicer or the Servicer of its respective
obligations under this Servicing Agreement.  

(g)               The Servicer or
the Back-up Servicer, if applicable, may enter into one or more subservicing
agreements (each, a   Subservicing Agreement  ) with one or more
Subservicers (each, a   Subservicer  ) for the servicing and
administration of certain of the Contracts;  provided ,  however, 
that unless the Insurer otherwise agrees in writing, the only servicing
functions that may be performed by Subservicers of the initial Servicer are (i)

Obligor on a monthly basis, (iii) receipt and posting of all payments received
with respect to the Contracts, (iv) tracking of Obligor compliance with

the Financed Vehicles and (viii) other functions pursuant to any other Subservicing
Agreement approved in writing by the Insurer;  provided ,  however ,
that entering into a Subservicing Agreement shall not relieve the Servicer or
the Back-up Servicer from any of their respective obligations hereunder.
References in this Servicing Agreement to actions taken or to be taken by the
Servicer in servicing the Contracts include actions taken or to be taken by a
Subservicer on behalf of the Servicer. Each Subservicing Agreement will be upon
such terms and conditions as are not inconsistent with this Servicing Agreement
and as the Servicer, or Back-up Servicer, as applicable, and the Subservicer
have agreed. The Servicer, or Back-up Servicer, as applicable, and a
Subservicer may enter into amendments thereto;  provided ,  however ,
that any such amendments shall be consistent with and not violate the
provisions of this Servicing Agreement.  

(h)               The Back-up
Servicer may be removed by the Insurer or, if an Insurer Default has occurred
and is continuing, by the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer, or the Indenture
Trustee at the direction of the Class A Noteholders evidencing not less than
51% of the Class A Note Balance, with or without cause upon thirty days 
written notice to the Back-up Servicer;  provided ,  however , that
(A) such removal may be made immediately and shall not require notice if: (i)
the Back-up Servicer shall consent to the appointment of a conservator,
receiver or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshalling of
assets and liabilities, or similar proceedings of or relating to the Back-up
Servicer or relating to all or substantially all of its property; or (ii) a
decree or order of a court or agency or supervisory authority having
jurisdiction in the premises for the appointment of a conservator or receiver
or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshalling of assets
and liabilities, or similar proceedings, or for the winding up or liquidation
of its affairs shall have been entered against the Back-up Servicer, and such
decree or order shall have remained in force undischarged or unstayed for a
period of 60 days; or (iii) the Back-up Servicer shall become insolvent or

assignment for the benefit of its creditors or voluntarily suspend payment of
its obligations; or (iv) a petition is filed against the Back-up Servicer
seeking relief under any applicable debtor relief laws of the United States or
any state or other competent jurisdiction, and such petition, order, judgment
or decree shall have remained in force undischarged or unstayed for a period of
60 days after its entry; and (B) such removal shall not be effective unless and
until a Successor Back-up Servicer is appointed by the Insurer or, if an
Insurer Default has occurred and is continuing, by the Indenture Trustee at the
direction of Noteholders evidencing not less than 51% of the Class A Note
Balance;  provided ,  however , that the Back-up Servicer may petition
a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a Successor Back-up Servicer if
one is not chosen within 60 days.

(b)               The Servicer
shall keep books and records, satisfactory to the Insurer, pertaining to each

hereby represents to the Servicer, based on certain representations the
Depositor has made to the Issuer concerning the Contracts in the Sale and
Allocation Agreement, and on which representations the Issuer has relied in
acquiring the Contracts and with respect to the pledge of the Contracts to the
Indenture Trustee, that each Contract and the sale of the related Financed
Vehicle complied at the time it was originated or made and on the Cutoff Date,
as the case may be, does comply in all material respects with all requirements
of applicable federal, state and local laws, and regulations thereunder.  

(b)               The Servicer
covenants that in the event that the Servicer realizes upon any Contract, the
methods utilized by the Servicer to realize upon such Contract or otherwise
enforce any provisions of the Contract, will not subject the Servicer, the
Issuer, the Noteholders, the Insurer or the Indenture Trustee to liability
under any federal, state or local law, and that such enforcement by the
Servicer will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Servicing
Agreement, the standard of care set forth in  Section 2.18  hereof and in
the Collection Policy.  

2.18.             Standard of
Care   . In performing its duties and obligations hereunder and in
administering and enforcing the Insurance Policies relating to the Contracts
pursuant to this Servicing Agreement, the Servicer will comply with all
applicable state and federal laws and shall service and administer the
Contracts by employing such procedures (including collection  

16  

procedures) and degree of care, in each case consistent with prudent
industry standards, as are customarily employed by the Servicer in servicing
and administering motor vehicle retail installment sales contracts and notes
owned or serviced by the Servicer comparable to the Contracts. In performing
such duties, so long as First Investors Servicing Corporation is the Servicer
(i) it shall comply with the Collection Policy, and (ii) it shall not make any
material amendment to such Collection Policy without the prior written consent
of the Insurer (provided that no Insurer Default shall have occurred and be continuing)

that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer shall not, except pursuant to
a judicial order from a court of competent jurisdiction, or as otherwise
required by applicable law or regulation, release or waive the right to collect
the unpaid balance on any Contract. In performing its duties and obligations
hereunder, the Servicer shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws
and regulations, shall maintain all state and federal licenses and franchises

behalf of the Noteholders in the Collateral.  

2.19.             Records   . The Servicer
shall maintain or cause to be maintained such books of account and other
records as will enable the Issuer and the Insurer to determine the status of
each Contract and any Insurance Policy relating thereto.  

2.20.             Inspection   .  

(a)               At all times during
the term hereof, the Servicer shall afford the Issuer, the Insurer, the Back-up
Servicer and the Indenture Trustee and their authorized agents, upon three
Business Days  prior written notice, reasonable access during normal business

records by the Issuer, the Insurer, the Back-up Servicer or the Indenture
Trustee, and will permit such parties to discuss the affairs, finances and
accounts of the Servicer with the chief operating officer and chief financial
officer of the Servicer. The examination referred to in this  Section 2.20 
will be conducted in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere with the
Servicer s normal operations or customer or employee relations. Without
otherwise limiting the scope of the examination, the Issuer, the Insurer, the
Back-up Servicer or the Indenture Trustee may, using generally accepted audit
procedures, verify the status of each Contract and review the Servicer Files
and records relating thereto for conformity to Monthly Servicer Reports
prepared pursuant to  Section 2.02(c)  and compliance with the standards
represented to exist as to each Contract in this Servicing Agreement. Nothing
herein shall require the Issuer, the Insurer, the Back-up Servicer or the
Indenture Trustee to conduct any inspection pursuant to this Section. Such
parties may, with the Servicer s consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the Servicer
with the Servicer s independent accountants, provided that an officer of the
Servicer shall have the right to be present during such discussions.  

(b)               At all times
during the term hereof, the initial Servicer shall keep available at its office
located at 380 Interstate North, Atlanta, Georgia 30559 (or such other location

and the Insurer), for inspection by the Issuer, the Insurer, the Back-up
Servicer and the Indenture Trustee a copy of the Contract Schedule, as amended.  

17  

(c)               All information
obtained by the Issuer, the Insurer, the Back-up Servicer or the Indenture Trustee
regarding the Obligors and the Contracts, whether upon exercise of its rights
under this  Section 2.20  or otherwise, shall be maintained by the Issuer,
the Insurer, the Back-up Servicer or the Indenture Trustee in confidence and
shall not be disclosed to any other Person, except as otherwise required by
applicable law or regulation.  

(d)               The Servicer
will, at the Issuer s or the Insurer s request, provide the Issuer or the
Insurer with a data extract disk of portfolio information.  

(e)               The Servicer and
the Insurer and their agents and representatives shall at all times have full
and free access during normal business hours to all computer tapes, books,
correspondence and records of the Back-up Servicer insofar as they relate to
the Contracts and the Insurer and its agents and representatives may examine
the same, take extracts therefrom and make photocopies thereof. The Servicer
and the Insurer each agree that all such information, practices, books,
correspondence and records are to be regarded as confidential information and
that (a) it shall retain in strict confidence and shall use its best efforts to
ensure that its representatives retain in strict confidence and will not
disclose without the prior written consent of the Back-up Servicer any or all of
such information practices, books, correspondence and records furnished to it
and (b) it will not, and it will use its best efforts (in the case of the
Insurer, consistent with Section 2.02 of the Insurance Agreement) to ensure
that its agents and representatives will not make any use whatsoever (other
than for purposes contemplated by this Agreement) of any of such information
practices, computer tapes books, correspondence and records without the prior
written consent of the Back-up Servicer, unless such information (i) is
generally available to the public, (ii) is required by law, regulation, or
court order to be disclosed or is requested by any governmental authority
having authority over the Servicer and the Insurer, or is necessary to preserve
any of such Persons  rights under or to enforce any provision of the Indenture,
or (iii) is required by the Rating Agencies in connection with their rating of
the related Notes or the implied rating of the facility.  

2.21.             Enforcement   .  

(a)               The Servicer
will, consistent with the standard of care required by Section 2.18 hereof, act
with respect to the Contracts and the Insurance Policies in such manner as
will, in the reasonable judgment of the Servicer, maximize the amount to be
received by the Indenture Trustee with respect thereto.  

(b)               The Servicer
shall to the extent consistent with the servicing standards set forth in  Section
2.18 , including the Collection Policy, or at the written direction of the
Insurer, sue to enforce or collect upon the Contracts and the Insurance
Policies (including unpaid claims), in its own name, if possible, or as agent
for the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee. If the Servicer commences a legal
proceeding to enforce a Contract or an Insurance Policy, the act of
commencement shall be deemed to be an automatic assignment of the Contract and
the related rights under the Insurance Policies by the Issuer to the Servicer
for purposes of collection only. If, however, in any enforcement suit or legal
proceeding it is held that the Servicer may not enforce a Contract or an
Insurance Policy on the grounds that it is not a real party in interest or a
holder entitled to enforce the Contract or the Insurance Policy, the Issuer
shall, at the Servicer s request, assign the Contract or the Insurance Policy
to the Servicer to the limited extent  

18  

necessary to enforce the Contract or the Insurance Policy, or take such
steps as the Issuer deems necessary to enforce the Contract or the Insurance
Policy, including bringing suit in its name.  

(c)               The Servicer
shall exercise any rights of recourse against third persons that exist with
respect to any Contract in accordance with the standard of care required by  Section
2.18  hereof. In exercising such recourse rights, the Servicer is hereby
authorized on the Issuer s behalf to reassign the Contract and to deliver the
certificate of title to the Financed Vehicle to the person against whom
recourse exists at the price set forth in the document creating the recourse.  

(d)               The Servicer
may grant to the Obligor on any Contract that has been repaid in full any
rebate, refund or adjustment that the Servicer in good faith believes is
required because of prepayment in full of the Contract, and may deduct the
amount of any such rebate, refund or adjustment from the amount otherwise
payable by the Servicer into the Collection Account. The Servicer may not
permit any rescission or cancellation of any Contract nor may it take any
action with respect to any Contract, except as required by applicable law,
regulation or court order, or Insurance Policy which would materially impair
the rights of the Indenture Trustee, the Insurer or the Noteholders therein or
in the proceeds thereof.  

2.22.             Payment in Full
on Contract   . Upon payment in full on any Contract, the Servicer
shall notify the Custodian prior to the next succeeding Determination Date by a
written request for the release of such Contract (which shall include a
statement of an officer of the Servicer to the effect that all amounts received
in connection with such payment in full which are required to be deposited in
the Collection Account pursuant to  Sections 3.02  and  3.03  hereof
have been so deposited).

specified herein, the Back-up Servicer shall be entitled to assume for all
purposes that the information received by it is true, correct and complete, and
the Back-up Servicer shall be fully protected in relying upon such information
without any independent investigation or audit to prove the facts stated
therein. The Back-up Servicer shall utilize such methods as it deems reasonable
and necessary to reconcile information provided by the Servicer with the cash

any discrepancy between the information set forth in subparagraphs (b) and (c),
as calculated by the Servicer, from that determined or calculated by the
Back-up Servicer, the Back-up Servicer shall promptly notify the Servicer, the
Indenture Trustee, and the Insurer of such discrepancy. If within ten days of
such notice being provided to the Servicer, the Back-up Servicer and the
Servicer are unable to resolve such discrepancy, the Back-up Servicer shall
promptly notify the Rating Agencies, the Insurer, the Indenture Trustee and any
other Persons identified on a list provided to the Back-up Servicer, as such
list may be amended from time to time, of such discrepancy.

Servicer shall have no obligation to supervise, verify, monitor or administer
the performance of the Servicer and shall have no liability for any action
taken or omitted by the Servicer.

Servicer shall consult fully with the Servicer as may be necessary from time to
time to perform or carry out the Back-up Servicer s obligations hereunder,

20

Omissions Insurance   . The Servicer has obtained, and shall continue to
maintain in full force and effect, errors and omissions insurance and employee

of any of its rights or powers, if the repayment of such funds or adequate
written indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to
it in writing prior to the expenditure or risk of such funds or incurrence of
financial liability.  

2.27.             Re-Liening   . Upon the
occurrence of a Re-Liening Trigger, the Insurer may instruct the Servicer to

title documents relating to such Financed Vehicles or by such other reasonable
means as may, in the judgment of the Insurer or its counsel, be necessary or

Issuer, as the case may be, shall inform the parties to this Agreement
promptly, in writing, upon the discovery of any breach or failure to be true of

Agreement. If such breach or failure shall not have been cured by the close of
business on the last day of the Collection Period which includes the thirtieth
(30th) day after the date on which the Servicer becomes aware of or receives
written notice from the Seller, the Insurer or the Issuer of, such breach or
failure, and such breach or failure materially and adversely affects the
interest of the Issuer or the Insurer in a Contract, the Servicer shall
repurchase such Contract from the Issuer on the Business Day next preceding the
Payment Date immediately following such Collection Period. In consideration of
the repurchase of a Contract hereunder, the Servicer shall remit the Purchase
Amount of such Contract in the manner specified in Section 3.4 of the Sale and
Allocation Agreement. The sole remedy of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the
Insurer (except as otherwise specified in the Insurance Agreement), and the
Noteholders with respect to a breach or failure to be true of the representations
and warranties made by the Servicer pursuant to this Agreement shall be to
require the Servicer to repurchase Contracts pursuant to this  Section 2.28 .
Neither the Owner Trustee nor the Indenture Trustee shall have any duty to
conduct an affirmative investigation as to the occurrence of any condition
requiring the repurchase of any Contract pursuant to this  Section 2.28 
or the eligibility of any Contract for purposes of this Agreement.

Association shall have no duty, responsibility, obligation or liability for the
acts and omissions of the prior Servicer;  provided ,  however , that

any error, inaccuracy, omission or incorrect or non-standard practice or
procedure (collectively,   Errors  ) exist in any Predecessor Servicer
Work Product and such Errors make it materially more difficult to service or
should cause or materially contribute to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association

circumstances to the Indenture Trustee and the Insurer and shall have no duty,
responsibility, obligation or liability for such Continued Errors;  provided ,

best efforts to prevent further Continued Errors. In the event that Wells Fargo
Bank, National Association becomes aware of Errors or Continued Errors, Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association shall, with the prior consent of the Indenture
Trustee and the Insurer, use its best efforts to reconstruct and reconcile such
data as is commercially reasonable to correct such Errors and Continued Errors

Trustee (to the extent an officer of the Indenture Trustee has actual knowledge
thereof), the Issuer, or the Indenture Trustee at the direction of Noteholders
evidencing not less than 51% of the Class A Note Balance), by notice given in
writing to the Servicer or the Back-up Servicer, as the case may be (  Termination
Notice  ) (with copies to the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer if given by
the Insurer), may terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Servicer
or the Back-up Servicer, as the case may be, under this Servicing Agreement
(except as set forth in  Section 5.03 ). On or after the receipt by the
Servicer of such Termination Notice, all authority, power, duties, obligations
and responsibilities of the Servicer under this Servicing Agreement, whether
with respect to the Contracts, or otherwise, automatically shall pass to, be
vested in and become obligations and responsibilities of the Back-up Servicer
(or such other Successor Servicer appointed in accordance herewith);  provided ,
 however , that the Successor Servicer shall have no liability with
respect to any obligation which was required to be performed by the terminated
Servicer prior to the date that the Successor Servicer becomes the Servicer or
any claim based on any alleged action or inaction of the terminated Servicer.
The Successor Servicer is authorized and empowered by this Agreement to execute
and deliver, on behalf of the terminated Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or
otherwise, any and all documents and other instruments and to do or accomplish
all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of
such Termination Notice, whether to complete the transfer and endorsement of
the Contracts and related documents to show the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee
as lienholder or secured party on the related title documents, or otherwise.
The terminated Servicer agrees to cooperate with the Successor Servicer in
effecting the termination of the responsibilities and rights of the terminated
Servicer under this Servicing Agreement, including, without limitation, the
transfer to the Successor Servicer for administration by it of all cash amounts
that shall at the time be held by the terminated Servicer for deposit, or have
been deposited by the terminated Servicer, in the Collection Account or
thereafter received with respect to the Contracts and the delivery to the
Successor Servicer of all Servicer Files, collection records and a computer
tape in  

29  

readable form as of the most recent Business Day containing all
information necessary to enable the Back-up Servicer or other Successor
Servicer, as the case may be, to service the Contracts. The terminated Servicer
shall grant the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the Successor Servicer and the
Insurer reasonable access to the terminated Servicer s premises at the
terminated Servicer s expense. Subject to  Section 2.08(b) , the Successor
Servicer shall be entitled to be reimbursed pursuant to Section 3.5(d)(i) of
the Sale and Allocation Agreement, to the extent described therein, and any
excess pursuant to 3.5(d)(x) of the Sale and Allocation Agreement for
reasonable costs incurred by it in connection with a transfer of servicing from
the Servicer to such Successor Servicer.  

(b)               On and after
the time the Servicer receives a Termination Notice pursuant to  Section
5.02(a) , the Back-up Servicer (unless the Insurer shall have exercised its
option pursuant to the following paragraph to appoint an alternate Successor
Servicer) shall be the successor in all respects to the Servicer in its
capacity as servicer under this Servicing Agreement and the transactions set
forth or provided for in this Servicing Agreement, and shall be subject to all
the rights, responsibilities, restrictions, duties, liabilities and termination
provisions relating thereto placed on the Servicer by the terms and provisions
of this Servicing Agreement except as otherwise stated herein. The Issuer and
such successor shall take such action, consistent with this Servicing
Agreement, as shall be necessary to effectuate any such succession. If a
Successor Servicer is acting as Servicer hereunder, it shall only be subject to
termination under  Section 5.02  upon the occurrence of any Event of
Servicing Termination with respect to such Successor Servicer.  

(c)               On and after
the receipt by the terminated Servicer of a Termination Notice pursuant to this
 Section 5.02 , the terminated Servicer shall continue to perform all
servicing functions under this Servicing Agreement until the date specified in
the Termination Notice. The Insurer (provided that no Insurer Default shall
have occurred and be continuing) may exercise at any time (after a Termination
Notice is given) its right to appoint as Successor Back-up Servicer or as
Successor Servicer a Person other than the Person serving as Indenture Trustee
or Back-up Servicer, as the case may be, at the time, and (without limiting the
Insurer s obligations under the Policy with respect to the Class A Notes) shall
have no liability to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the Person then serving
as Back-up Servicer, any Noteholder or any other Person if it does so. If a
Successor Servicer is not chosen within 90 calendar days after the receipt by
the Servicer of the Termination Notice, the Back-up Servicer shall act as
Successor Servicer unless it is legally unable to do so, in which event the
outgoing Servicer shall continue to act as Servicer until a successor has been
appointed and accepted such appointment. If the Back-up Servicer shall be
legally unable to act as Servicer, and an Insurer Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, the Back-up Servicer, the Indenture Trustee, Noteholders
evidencing not less than 51% of the Class A Note Balance or the Issuer may
petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an Eligible Servicer as
the Successor Servicer. Notwithstanding the above, no provision of this
Servicing Agreement shall be construed as relieving the Back-up Servicer of its
obligation to succeed as Successor Servicer upon the termination of the
Servicer pursuant to this  Section 5.02  or the resignation of the
Servicer pursuant to  Section 5.09 . If, upon the termination of the
Servicer pursuant to this  Section 5.02  or the resignation of the
Servicer pursuant to  Section 5.09 , the Insurer appoints a Successor
Servicer other than the Back-up Servicer, the Back-up Servicer shall not be
relieved of its duties as Back-up Servicer hereunder. Within 30 days of
termination of the Servicer, if such termination causes a change in the address  

30  

to which Obligor payments are to be sent, the Successor Servicer shall
send, or cause to be sent, to each Obligor, a written notice of the name and
mailing address of the Successor Servicer to which payments on the Contracts
are to be made.  

(d)               The Insurer or,
if an Insurer Default has occurred and is continuing, the Indenture Trustee,
the Issuer, or the Indenture Trustee at the direction of Noteholders evidencing
not less than 51% of the Class A Note Balance shall as promptly as possible
appoint a Successor Back-up Servicer following delivery of a Termination Notice
with respect to the Back-up Servicer. If the Insurer or Indenture Trustee, as
applicable, shall fail to approve a Successor Back-up Servicer within 30 days
of the date of a Termination Notice, the Indenture Trustee may petition a court
of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a Successor Back-up Servicer
that is an Eligible Servicer. Notwithstanding the above, the Indenture Trustee
shall, if it is legally unable so to act, petition a court of competent
jurisdiction to appoint any Eligible Servicer as the Successor Back-up Servicer
hereunder.  

(e)               Upon its
appointment, the Successor Servicer or Successor Back-up Servicer, as the case
may be, shall be the successor in all respects to the terminated Servicer or
Back-up Servicer, as the case may be, with respect to servicing functions under
this Servicing Agreement and shall be subject to all the responsibilities,
duties and liabilities (arising on and after the time of such appointment
except for liability arising from the condition of the Servicer s records at
the time the servicing duties are transferred to the Back-up Servicer or other
Successor Servicer or for actions or omissions of other Persons) relating
thereto placed on the Servicer or Back-up Servicer, respectively, by the terms
and provisions hereof (except as otherwise provided in this Servicing Agreement
with respect to the Back-up Servicer acting as Servicer), any Successor
Servicer shall become the successor Administrator in accordance with Section 20
of the Administration Agreement, and all references in this Servicing Agreement
to the Servicer or Back-up Servicer shall be deemed to refer to the Successor
Servicer or Successor Back-up Servicer unless the context otherwise requires;  provided ,
 however , that the Successor Servicer shall have (i) no liability with
respect to any obligation which was required to be performed by the terminated
Servicer prior to the date that the Successor Servicer becomes the Servicer or
any claim of a third party based on any alleged action or inaction of the
terminated Servicer, (ii) no obligation to perform any repurchase or advancing obligations,
if any, of the Servicer, (iii) no obligation to pay any taxes required to be
paid by the Servicer, (iv) no obligation to pay any of the fees and expenses of
any other party involved in this transaction and (v) no liability or obligation
with respect to any Servicer indemnification obligations of any prior servicer
including the original servicer. The indemnification obligations of the Backup
Servicer, upon becoming a Successor Servicer, are expressly limited to matters
arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Backup Servicer
in its role as Successor Servicer.  

(f)                In connection
with such appointment and assumption, the Back-up Servicer may make such
arrangements for the compensation of itself and the Successor Servicer out of
collections of Contract payments, as it and such Successor Servicer shall
agree;  provided ,  however , that no such compensation shall be in
excess of the Back-up Servicing Fees and Monthly Servicing Fees permitted to
the Back-up Servicer and the Servicer, respectively, pursuant to this Servicing
Agreement without the approval of the Insurer or, if an Insurer Default has
occurred and is continuing, Noteholders evidencing not less than 51% of the
Class A Note Balance.  

31  

5.03.             Indemnity by
the Servicer   . The Servicer shall be liable to the Issuer, the
Insurer, the Indenture Trustee, the Holders of the Class A Notes, the Owner
Trustee, the Paying Agent and Certificate Registrar under the Trust Agreement
and the Back-up Servicer (collectively, the   Indemnified Parties  ) to
the extent of the following:  

(a)               The Servicer
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties and any of
the officers, directors, employees and agents of the Indemnified Parties from
and against any and all costs, expenses, losses, damages, claims and
liabilities, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and expenses of
litigation, arising out of or resulting from the use, ownership or operation by
the Servicer or any affiliate thereof of a Financed Vehicle.  

(b)               The Servicer
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties and any of
the officers, directors, employees and agents of the Indemnified Parties from
and against any and all costs, expenses, losses, claims, damages and
liabilities to the extent that such cost, expense, loss, claim, damage or
liability arose out of, or was imposed upon any such Person through the breach
of this Servicing Agreement by the Servicer, the negligence, misfeasance or bad
faith of the Servicer in the performance of its duties under this Servicing
Agreement or by reason of reckless disregard of its obligations and duties
under this Servicing Agreement.  

(c)               The Servicer
shall be strictly accountable for all payments actually received on the
Contracts.  

THE FOREGOING
INDEMNIFICATION SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT SUCH  SECTION 5.03  LIABILITIES
AND COSTS ARE IN ANY WAY OR TO ANY EXTENT OWED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, UNDER ANY
CLAIM OR THEORY OF STRICT LIABILITY, OR ARE CAUSED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY ANY
NEGLIGENT ACT OR OMISSION OF ANY KIND BY ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY.  

(d)               Notwithstanding
any thing herein to the contrary, the Servicer shall not be obligated to
indemnify any Person with respect to any amounts representing recourse for
uncollectible Contracts.  

(e)               Notwithstanding
any other provision in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to the
contrary, should the Back-up Servicer by any means become Successor Servicer,
the Back-up Servicer shall not inherit any of the indemnification obligations
with respect to the actions of any prior servicer including the original
Servicer.  

5.04.             Procedure for
Indemnification   . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Servicing Agreement, in the event that an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to the terms of this Servicing Agreement, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnity
may be sought (hereinafter called the   Indemnifying Party  ) in writing
and the Indemnifying Party, upon request of the Indemnified Party, shall retain
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party or, at the Indemnified
Party s option, such Indemnified Party may select its own counsel with the
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, to represent the Indemnified Party  

32  

and any others the Indemnified Party may designate in such proceeding
and shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to
such proceeding. It is understood that the Indemnifying Party shall not, in
connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction,
be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm
at any one time (in addition to any local counsel) for all such Indemnified
Parties (unless necessary because of conflicts of interest), and all such fees
and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be
designated in writing by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, but if
settled with such consent or if there be an adverse final judgment, the
Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against

by reason of any act, contract or transaction performed in good faith by the
Back-up Servicer pursuant to this Servicing Agreement nor shall it be liable
for any loss resulting therefrom or for any lost profit derived therefrom or
any errors in judgment, so long as such act, contract or transaction shall, at
the time at which it was performed or entered into, have been reasonable and
prudent under the circumstances and shall have conformed in all material
respects to the express provisions of this Servicing Agreement or (ii) for any
action taken or for errors in judgment committed directly resulting from fraud,

expiration of any applicable grace period, the Servicer or the Back-up Servicer

Unless the Insurer, or if an Insurer Default has occurred and is continuing,
Noteholders evidencing not less than 51% of the Class A Note Balance, gives
written notice to the Servicer or the Back-up Servicer, as the case may be,
within seven Business Days of receipt of such notice from the Servicer or the
Back-up Servicer that the Insurer or Noteholders evidencing not less than 51%
of the Class A Note Balance, as the case may be, have waived such Event of
Servicing Termination, the Servicer or the Back-up Servicer, as the case may
be, shall then give notice in writing to the Rating Agencies, the Issuer and
any other Persons identified on a list provided to the Servicer or the Back-up

5.07.             Waiver of Event

shall have occurred and be continuing) may waive any Event of Servicing
Termination, except for an Event of Servicing Termination arising by virtue of
a default in making any required deposits to or payments from the Collection
Account, the Class A Note Payment Account, the Class B Note Payment Account or
the Reserve Account in accordance with this Servicing Agreement.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Insurer (if no Insurer Default
shall have occurred and be continuing) may, on behalf of all Noteholders, waive
any Event of Servicing Termination. Upon any such waiver of an Event of  

33  

Servicing Termination, such default shall cease to exist, and any
default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been remedied for every
purpose of this Servicing Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other default or impair any rights of the Noteholders or the
Insurer with respect to subsequent Events of Servicing Termination consequent
thereon except to the extent expressly so waived.  

5.08.             Survival   . The
agreements in  Section 5.03  shall survive the termination of the
Indenture, the removal, resignation or replacement of the Servicer and the
payment in full of the Notes.  

5.09.             Servicer and
Back-up Servicer Not to Resign   . Subject to the provisions
of  Section 5.02 , neither the Servicer nor the Back-up Servicer shall
resign from the obligations and duties imposed on it by this Servicing
Agreement as Servicer or Back-up Servicer except upon a determination that by
reason of a change in legal requirements the performance of its duties under
this Servicing Agreement would cause it to be in violation of such legal
requirements in a manner which would have a material adverse effect on the
Servicer or the Back-up Servicer, as the case may be, and the Insurer does not
elect to waive the obligations of the Servicer or the Back-up Servicer, as the
case may be, to perform the duties which render it legally unable to act or to
delegate those duties to another Person. Any such determination permitting the
resignation of the Servicer or Back-up Servicer shall be evidenced by an
opinion of counsel to such effect delivered and acceptable to the Issuer, the
Indenture Trustee, and the Insurer. No resignation of the Servicer shall become
effective until the Back-up Servicer or an entity acceptable to the Insurer (if
no Insurer Default shall have occurred and be continuing) shall have assumed
the responsibilities and obligations of the Servicer. No resignation of the
Back-up Servicer shall become effective until an entity acceptable to the
Insurer shall have assumed the responsibilities and obligations of the Back-up
Servicer;  provided ,  however , that in the event a successor
Back-up Servicer is not appointed within 60 days after the Back-up Servicer has
given notice of its resignation and has provided the opinion of counsel
required by this  Section 5.09 , the Back-up Servicer may petition a court
of competent jurisdiction for its removal.

FIRST INVESTORS FINANCIAL SERVICES   

RETAIL COLLECTION POLICY   OPERATING PROCEDURES   

March 2003  

Preface    

This procedure explains the First Investors Financial
(FIFS) policy for collections. In addition, this section explains the various
methods to be employed by office personnel to maximize collection efforts; FIFS
complies with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and all applicable state
and federal laws and regulations. (For specific requirements or specific state
legislation refer to Legal Procedures.)  

Note:  Any  exception       to this policy manual needs to
be approved by a Manager or higher Authority.    

Office
Responsibilities    

The office goals are:  

Successful
and profitable liquidation of accounts receivables; 

To
maintain client satisfaction- which leads to repeat business. 

The office can meet these
objectives by establishing timely and effective collection practices.  

The importance of immediate
follow-up on a delinquent account cannot be over-emphasized. The later in the
delinquency cycle a customer is contacted, the fewer options are available to
FIFS and the customer.  

Profitability on an account
is effected by more than the potential loss on repossession. An account that
must be contacted every month for payment is incrementally less profitable than
an account that pays  as agreed,  even though all payments are made in both
cases.  

Collections
Unit Organization    

FIFS organizes the
collection department by utilizing an online (auto dialer system) and offline
system consisting of three steps:  

Accounts
are assigned to collection queues determined by: 1) the delinquency of the
account (days past due), 2) the status of the account (repossession,
bankruptcy, skip, etc.) and 3) the balance of workloads. 

Accounts
are assigned to in-house collectors titled Account Service Representatives.
(ASR s) according to experience level and previous performance. 

The
ASR is responsible for ensuring proper collection follow-up for all assigned
accounts. The ASR s are separated into two departments. The front-line
collection  group handles accounts under
30 days past due. Back-end collectors handle accounts over 30 days past due
until resolution ( i.e. account brought 

2  

current, paid-in-full, repossessed or
forwarded to a specialty unit such as bankruptcy or litigation).  

Account
Distribution    

The basis of the FIFS
collection philosophy is that all past due accounts not already awaiting
resolution or another specific strategy, will be reviewed for daily activity. This
is the minimum requirement, but collectors are encouraged to follow up as often
as conditions warrant. Daily Routine will be governed by each collection
department to ensure best coverage and delinquency management for all past due
accounts.  

Account
Tracking    

FIFS uses an automated collection system that tracks
all delinquent accounts. The system is extremely flexible and allows FIFS
maximum ability to organize collection follow-up. The collection system
contains data on all accounts and provides collector  queues  based on a number
of variables including, balance, days past due, behavioral score, test group,
and credit score.  

On the first day of delinquency, accounts are placed
in the collection system for follow-up. Each ASR is given a collection queue to
manage on a daily basis. The accounts are randomly distributed to each queue
based on delinquency level and ASR experience. Accounts remain with the
assigned collector until a point is reached requiring designation of another
ASR or department.  

Telephone
Collection Concept    

Emphasis is placed on the use of the telephone as the
primary tool for customer contact. It is the most effective collection tool. Telephone
contact is quick and provides immediate results. Poor follow-up results in the
loss of revenue and potential repeat customers.  

The
advantages of telephone collection follow-up are: 

Efficiency-  The collector is able to contact more customers
during a given time period. 

Low Cost-  In comparison to travel and direct contact
expenses. 

Privacy-  The collector is able to take notes and refer to
records without distracting the customer. 

The
Collection Call    

An effective collection call is made up of a series of
logical steps. These steps assure that all the information needed from
customers is obtained, while also meeting all of FIFS legal and ethical
requirements.  

3  

The steps of an effective collection call are listed
and described below. Always follow and complete the steps as the customer and
the nature of the individual call dictate. This will ensure a thorough and
successful contact.

customer 

                                                Set
customer expectations 

Before ending the call, verify pertinent customer
information such as residence address and telephone, current employment and
telephone and any mobile or pager numbers, to facilitate the next contact.   Always determine the location of and who is in possession of our
collateral.    

If the customer states the delinquent payment was
mailed, the ASR should confirm the amount of the payment mailed, type of
payment (check, cashier check, etc.), and source of the funds.   The customer should be reminded that there is no grace period and to
allow for mailing time.    

If the customer has not mailed a payment to bring the
loan current, arrangements for bringing the account current should be made. Arrangements
for all past due monies as well as future payments should be set-up by the
collector and agreed upon by the customer.   On all collection calls
the reason for delinquency (RFD) should be discussed and noted.    

The ASR should attempt to use urgency payments on all
past due payments. Western Union Quick Collect should be the main source of
urgency suggested (express mail is another good delivery tool).   Phone Pay should be offered on EVERY collection call.    

The customer benefits of using phone pay are: 1)it is
less expensive than Western Union Quick Collect, 2) the customer s voided check
provides them with a permanent record and 3) the customer receives a
confirmation letter from Western Union.  

It is important that all details of the collection
call be noted for future use.   

Working
with the Customer    

Proper account handling is critical to the success of
First Investors Financial Services. The first step in providing quality account
servicing is to recognize who the customer is. Virtually every person whom we
come in contact with while acting as a FIFS employee is our customer. The next
step is to understand the elements that comprise Quality Customer Service  
service that not only meets, but also exceeds our customers  expectations.  

The
Three C s    

Quality Customer Service consist of three basic
elements:  

Competence 

                     Concern 

                     Courtesy 

5  

Competence   

The ability to deliver quality customer service depends
on the employee s competence   having the knowledge and skill necessary to do
the job properly.  

Simply having job knowledge and skills is just the
starting point. Each employee must also   demonstrate   to
both internal and external customers that he/she can do the job- that the
employee can deliver on our promise of quality customer service. Few things are
more frustrating to a customer than dealing with a company whose employees lack
competence. When competence is missing in a customer contact, the customer
doubts the ability of the employee to provide quality service.  

The specific knowledge and skill required to perform a
task completely differ from job to job, but there are four broad competency
standards that apply to any job:  

1.                                            Demonstrate efficient job skill:    Every job at FIFS has a set of job skills
necessary for performance of the job. It is important to understand that
whatever a person s job, our customers expect employees to know how to perform
the skills for which they are responsible in quick and efficiently manner. 

2.                                            Demonstrate knowledge of FIFS, its policies and procedures.   To
the customer, each employee is FIFS. Therefore, employees will often be in the
position of having to explain company policies and procedures in a way that
makes them sound logical and customer-oriented, rather than arbitrary. This
includes understanding your own span of authority. Know when it is appropriate
to get others involved when helping customers (i.e. when customers request
exceptions to settlement policy requirements). 

3.                                            Provide complete information.   Customers expect that FIFS
will provide all the information they will reasonably need about its 
processes, procedures and policies. It is every employee s responsibility to
know these things and to be able to tell the customer what they need to know. We
should never leave it up to the customer to discover things on his or her own. 

4.                                            Know where to get information.   Another requirement of
competency is to know what resources to consult, whether those resources are
manuals or fellow employees. An employee is not expected to know everything. Even
the most demanding customers will understand that the person they re speaking
with may not have the answer to a problem, as long as an answer can be obtained
within a timely fashion. 

Show concern.   All customers want
to feel the companies they deal with have a genuine concern for them and their
needs. Without concern, the positive impression created by Competence will
quickly disappear. When concern is missing, customers feel like they are just a
number and are not valued. Showing concern involves following a few simple
guidelines: 

1.                                            Project a warm, friendly presence.   A smile goes a long way
toward making customer s feel that their concerns really matter. That may seem
obvious when dealing with a 

6  

customer face-to-face, but it is equally true
over the telephone. Studies have shown that when people smile while talking on
the telephone, the person on the other end of the line  hears the smile  in
their voice. An added benefit is that smiling tends to make a person more
relaxed and less stressed.  

2.                                            Use the customer s name.   All people like to be recognized
and respected. One simple way to show respect and recognition of customers as
individuals with their own unique identity is by using their names. When using
customers  names, do so at times when it is natural. Do not use names so
frequently that it becomes forced or insincere. A good rule of thumb is to try
to use the customer s name two to three times during a conversation. 

3.                                            Express empathy.   Empathy is the ability for the ASR to put
him/herself in the  customers  shoes    to show understanding of their points
of views and concerns. Expressing empathy requires careful listening to what
the customer says, and sincere understanding of his/her underlying feelings of
frustration, fear, or anger. A simple  I m sorry that happened  when mistakes
occur goes a long way toward defusing customer anger, and shows that the ASR
understands the customer s point of view. It is possible to show we understand
a customer s problem without accepting fault on the part of the company. 

4.                                            Take responsibility for customer satisfaction.   When contact
is made with a customer, the ASR s job is not finished until the customer s
needs have been met. If the ASR can not personally satisfy the need, the
customer should be directed to someone who can. Also, when the ASR is presented
with a problem that the customer perceives to be  our  fault, it is extremely
important to avoid blaming someone else in the company. We all  own  customer
problems and blaming others simply appears to the customer as  passing the buck .
Whatever agreement is made with a customer be sure that the agreement is
carried through and followed-up as stated. 

5.                                            The ASR should give the customer their undivided attention.   No
one is more important than the customer. No office activity is more important
than a conversation with a customer. To make sure customers get this message
loudly and clearly, the ASR will need to take precautions to ensure that when
serving a customer, they keep interruptions to an absolute minimum. In
particular, they should avoid side conversations with other employees unless it
is directly related to the customer s need. If it becomes necessary to leave
the customer to obtain information, clearly explain where you are going, and
how long it will take. 

Courtesy   

Practicing courtesy towards a customer sounds like
simple common sense. Who would be intentionally rude to a customer?  However, one s behavior can sometimes appear
discourteous unintentionally. Unprofessional greetings, abrupt, unexplained
holds, and long waits equal bad business conduct because customers perceive
these behaviors as rude.  

7  

Courtesy is almost synonymous with respectfulness.
  Being courteous in a business setting is a matter of
following rules of etiquette designed to show respect. 

Greet and respond to customers quickly and
properly.   It is common courtesy that the ASR responds quickly
and properly to any customer who calls on the telephone. Remember that
customers are not interruptions. Taking care of customers is our primary job. If
the person who normally greets customers is not available, the ASR should take
it upon his/herself to greet the customer. 

When using the customers  name, use their title
and last name.   For example,  Good afternoon, Mr. Marks.   Do not address customers by their first
names. 

Listen to customers.   Listening
without interrupting may be the most important element of quality customer
service. Listening to customers is a matter of respect. It is virtually
impossible to show concern, demonstrate competence, or practice courtesy if the
ASR does not first listen to what the customer has to say. 

Listening to customers goes beyond hearing what they
have to say. An important part of listening is to assure customers that they
are being listened to.   This means that the ASR
needs to actively listen.   Questions should be asked to get customers
to explain situations fully. Summarize what the customers says to show that
they are understood. Once the ASR has demonstrated active listening, it will be
possible to express empathy, take responsibility for customer satisfaction, and
provide complete information.  

Ensure the customers  understanding.   In
order to ensure that the ASR has successfully handled a customer s request or
need to its resolution, The collector should discuss the interaction with the
customer.   Unless both the ASR and the customer come away
from the contact with the same understanding of what has occurred or been
decided, we have not provided quality customer service.   

Reconfirm the action that you or the customer will
take.   For example,  Okay, Mr. Carr, you are going to talk to
your banker about a consolidation loan so that we can get your account settled.  

Know and use telephone etiquette.   The
majority of contacts with customers occur via telephone, so it is essential to
know and use the rules of telephone etiquette. 

Telephone
Etiquette    

Be professional.   Talk in a
friendly tone and control your rate of speech. 

To convey competence, concern, and courtesy when
handling telephone calls, each ASR should use the following:  

Answer promptly.   Answer calls between the first and third
ring. Generally, the optimal point to answer is after the second ring. 

8  

Greet the caller.   When answering the telephone say:   Thank you for calling FIFS. This is [your
name], how may I help you?   This will
usually cause the customer to provide the information you need to be able to
respond, either by helping the customer yourself, or by directing the call to
the appropriate person. 

Handle or direct the call.   Either handle the call yourself
or direct the call to the employee who can best serve the customer s needs. Identify
the caller and obtain the account number when appropriate. 

Use holds when necessary.   If it is necessary to put callers
on hold, proceed as follows: 

Request and obtain caller s permission to put
them on hold.   For example,   
 It will take a minute to look up your payment information. Will you please
hold?   

Do not leave callers on hold for longer than on minute without
returning to the line.   If it is necessary to extend the hold,
explain the delay, and ask callers if they will continue to hold. If this is
other than a collection call, offer to have the appropriate person call back if
the hold will have to continue for more than a minute. 

When picking up a call that was on hold, thank the customer for holding.
    For example,    Thank
you for holding, Mr. Carr. I have the information for you now.  

Always use the hold feature on your telephone so that the customer
cannot hear office conversation while waiting.   

Transfer when appropriate.   When referring a call to another
employee for handling: Tell the callers the first and last name of the person
whom they will be speaking.   For
example,    Mr. Carr, I ll be transferring you to Marge Sands. 

Thank the customer.   

Use
the holds skill to transfer the call    

Tell the employee the caller s name and the reason for
the call. For example,  Marge, I have Mr. Carr on the line. He wants to know
about the settlement offer he faxed to you.   

Pick-up Transfers properly.       When picking up a call that was transferred: 

1)  Greet the caller by name.  

2)  Tell the caller your name (must be done
within the first 60 seconds of a call)  

3)  Restate the purpose of the call.  

9  

For example,     Hello, Mr. Carr. This
is Marge Sands. I understand you have a question about the letter you received
this morning.  This lets the caller know that the ASR has been informed of the
reason for their call. 

Take messages.   Always try to take care of the caller or
direct the call to someone who can do so. When it is not possible, take
complete and accurate messages. Follow these guidelines: 

Obtain
the caller s name, telephone number, and nature of the call. 

If
the caller has a difficult name, ask for the correct spelling and not the
correct pronunciation phonetically. 

For example,    Stawiarski 
would be correctly spelled on the message and then the phonetic spelling,  Stavarski ,
would be noted in parentheses. 

Conclude the call positively.   End each telephone call on a
positive note: 

Thank the customer for calling.   

Voice
Quality    

When the ASR talks to someone over the telephone,
personality is conveyed entirely through voice. Because we do not have the
advantage of facial expression and body language when speaking on the phone,
our voice needs to communicate warmth, friendliness, and a desire to be of
service to all callers. If the ASR is smiling, the smile will be reflected in
his/her voice by a friendly tone. If the ASR is slouched in their chair, their
voice is likely to have an indifferent, lackadaisical quality, instead of
sounding eager to serve.  

To help communicate competence, concern and courtesy
for customers while speaking over the phone, 
the ASR should speak as thought the caller were seated across the desk
from them. Smile when appropriate, even though the caller can t see the smile. ASR s
should sit up straight, and focus attention to the caller.  

Voice
Quality    

There are four elements to a professional businesslike
voice quality:  

Tone, Rate, Volume and Diction   

Following is a description of each element and
suggestions for effective use.  

Tone   

This should be friendly, warm, and courteous without
being overly familiar or formal. An ASR should always smile. Even when speaking
about a serious matter and the customer has become upset, continue to be
friendly and professional.  

10  

Rate   

Generally, it is best that the ASR match rate of
speech to that of the customer. If the ASR speaks much faster than the customer
does, the customer may get the impression that 
rushing to them off the telephone. Speaking slower than the customer, on
the other hand, can give the impression that the ASR is unsure or perhaps bored
and do not place high priority on the callers needs.  

Volume   

The ASR should Speak as though they were speaking to
someone seated across the desk, unless the caller has difficulty hearing at
this normal volume. A low volume makes the ASR sound timid and uncertain. A
high volume makes the ASR sound harsh and insensitive.  

Diction   

Pronounce each worked clearly to make sure that what
is being said is understood and sounds professional. Be careful not to use run
on words or  swallow  word endings.  

Reasons
for Delinquency    

There are two things to keep in mind about customers
with delinquent accounts. First, customers whose accounts have become
delinquent and have had their account placed with our office are not our
adversaries. These are the same people who we investigated and to whom we
extended credit not long ago based on the facts that this customer had the
ability and the willingness to repay their obligations. One of the ASR s key
responsibilities, then, is to determine what has changed since that time and
how we can work with the customer to resolve the situation to our mutual benefit.  

Second, keep in mind that there are many reasons why
an account may become delinquent. These Include:  

Unemployment or Reduction in Income     Layoffs,
strikes, slow times in business resulting in fewer hours and lower pay,
termination, disability, or retirement can all seriously affect a customer s
ability to meet payment obligations. 

Unforeseen Expenses / Over obligation     A
sudden or unforeseen jump in expenses such as medical costs, car repairs or
dental bills can affect the customer s ability to repay their loan or bills. Also,
a customer who does not handle his or her money well many incur more debt than
can be reasonably managed with available resources. 

Vehicle Purchase Dispute     Sometimes,
customers encounter problems with the vehicle they purchased. When this occurs,
customers will often stop paying and never have the matter resolved. 

Divorce or Separation     A change
in the customer s marital status can significantly affect his or her income due
to the pressures of alimony, new housing expenses, child support, loss of a
spouse s financial contribution to a household, etc. 

11  

Illness     If a customer becomes
ill and cannot work for a period of time, or if illness strikes a member of his
or her family, a loss of income and the cost of medical expenses can affect his
or her ability to meet financial obligations. 

Helping
Find Solutions    

While all of these circumstances are regrettable, most
are temporary. Even in cases of bankruptcy or death, it is possible to collect
on the account. Generally, we will find that customers would like to repay
their obligations if they could only figure out how to do it in light of their
altered circumstances.  

The ASR can offer a valuable service to these
customers and to FIFS by helping them find the best solution that will let them
pay the money they owe. This includes finding the reason behind why the are not
paying, and letting the customer know that FIFS wants to help them solve the
problem. The next step for the ASR is to work on a plan that will allow then to
pay off their account as soon as possible.  

The most effective way to prevent delinquency is to
manage each account on a daily basis. To do this, the ASR must keep account
records up to date, anticipate problems whenever possible, and communicate with
customers frequently to ensure promises are kept.  

Objective is to educate the customer and resolve
delinquency. There are several practices to remember while you work towards
resolution.  

Telephone
is the primary tool 

                                                Work
accounts daily 

                                                Firm
communication, keep control 

                                                Follow
up on broken promises 

                                                Always
obtain reason for delinquency 

                                                Stress
urgency to get account paid 

                                                Educate
customers on payment options 

                                                Repeat
arrangements 

                                                Verify
account information 

                                                Educate
follow up 

                                                Set
the customers Expectations. 

Right Party Contacts (customer)   

Who
you spoke with (the person s name). 

                                                Actual
Reason for delinquency. 

                                                When
they will be paying. 

                                                The
amount of the payment. 

                                                The
source from where the funds for the payment is coming form. 

                                                When
they will be making their next payment. 

                                                Any
other relative facts that will help collect the account now and in the future. 

                                                Verify
home address, telephone number and any employment information 

12  

Third Party Contacts   

Who
you spoke with (the person s name and relation to customer). 

                                                When
the customer will be home for a return call. 

                                                If
you did or did not leave a message. 

                                                Where
the customer is at the time of the call. 

                                                Any
other information provided by the person you spoke with that will help with
future collections. 

All notes should be clear and easy to understand.  

Opinions about the customer should not be formed or
noted on the collection record. Stick to the facts and details of the call.  

If the customer is not reached after reasonable
attempts and messages have been left for return calls, the customer file should
be pulled and references should be contacted. If the ASR is able to contact a
reference, the ASR should attempt to update the customer s file, verifying home
address, telephone and any employment information. A call back number should be
left with the reference for the customer.  

* When speaking with a third party, ALWAYS ask for
permission to call them in the future with respect to confirming information
regarding our customer. Once they give permission, document it clearly in the
notes.  

*FDCPA states only to contact a 3rd party again if
requested by the third party or if you have reason to believe information is
erroneous.  

After references have been worked, the ASR should
obtain a neighbor and related name list for location calls and messages. A
neighbor should only verify our customer s address.  

If attempts to reach the customer are unsuccessful,
the ASR should confirm that we have the best possible address and employment
information. This information should help to assist in the repossession
process.  

If the above have been completed, the unit supervisor
should review the account for final resolution.  

Record all ISDN (caller ID number) numbers supplied in
permanent text.  

Input the appropriate activity code and associated
note into the collection system. The system automatically assigns the current
date and time. The note should recap the results of the contact.  

Follow-up on any promises or commitments on
agreed-upon dates.  

Note:     It is recommended that headsets be used by all
collectors.  

13  

The
office must avoid conducting telephone activities, which fall into the
following categories:    

1.                                             Hours of collections      Telephone
calls to customers can be made from 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM in their respective time
zones Monday through Friday. Calls are also made on weekends and holidays. If
the customer specifically requests contact outside the 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM
window, and there is no conflict with that states laws, then calls can be made. 

2.                                             Calls to friends, neighbors, relatives, and
children    - The only reason for such calls is an attempt to
locate a customer who has moved without advising FIFS of his new address. In
that case, discussion of the account is    not   
permissible since it could embarrass the customer and violate federal and/or
state privacy laws. 

3.                                             Calls making a variety of threats    -
Threats should never be made, stated, or implied. Discussions of the
possibility of repossession might be considered a form of threat and should not
be used in such manner. Repossession is and should be the last resort. Unless
FIFS is ready and has the present intent to take legal action, this possibility
should not be mentioned. 

4.                                             Calls asserting falsely that credit ratings will
be hurt    - Offices must be careful of this because it is
difficult to define. Discussion of such a possibility might also be considered
a form of threat. Use language such as  are you aware that information
concerning your account is regularly reported to credit reporting agencies. 
Threats should never be made, stated, or implied. 

5.                                             Calls falsely saying that legal process is about to
be served    - Unless FIFS is ready, willing, and has the present
intent to take legal action, this possibility should not be mentioned. Threats
should never be made, stated, or implied. 

6.                                             Calls to places of employment     -
When calling the customer s employment care must be taken to ensure that the
customer is able and willing to discuss the account freely, so as to avoid
possible embarrassment with his fellow workers. Do not contact the customer at
place of employment if it actually known, or if there is any such reason to
know that the customer s employer prohibits such calls or if restricted by
state law. 

7.                                          Phone messages
should include collector name, company phone number and extension ONLY. 

Calls after office receives written request to
cease communication   - If the customer notifies the office in
writing to cease communication, or that they refuse to pay the debt, the office
will not communicate further, except to: 

Advise
the customer that the office collection efforts are being terminated; 

Notify
the customer that the office will invoke specific remedies which are ordinarly
invoked. 

14  

Where
applicable, notify the customer that the office intends to invoke a specific
remedy. 

Representative by an attorney   - If
it is known that the customer is represented by an attorney with regard to the
debt, communication should be made only with the attorney. The customer may be
contacted if the attorney so agrees, or the attorney does not respond within a
reasonable time. In general, five business days are the maximum amount of time
necessary to make the determination unless legal counsel has advised otherwise. 

Misrepresentation,
Harassment, Abuse    

In addition to the above-prohibited activities, listed
below are the other collection approaches that  must  not be used.  

The
use of threat of violence, to harm the person, the person s family, the person s
reputation, or the person s property. 

The
use of obscene or profane language, or language which the receiving party could
consider abusive. 

Causing
a telephone to ring continuously or telephoning a person repeatedly. 

The
placement of telephone calls without disclosing your identity except as
provided in Procedure 419, Skip Tracing. 

Continuous
attempts to contact a customer through his employer thereby jeopardizing his
continued employment. 

Failure
to reveal to the customer that the purpose of the communication is to collect a
debt. 

The
circulation of a list of customers who refuse to pay their debts (a  dead-beat 
list). Valid account information provided on specific accounts to a credit
bureau or to the selling dealer is not prohibited. 

Threats
to take action (s) that cannot legally be taken, or that are not actually
intended to be taken. 

Implying
that non-payment will result in arrest, imprisonment, or garnishment of wages. 

The
false representation of the amount or status of an account, or the penalties or
service charges which may be assessed because of non-payment. 

15  

Communicating,
or threatening to communicate to any person, false credit information about the
customer or the account. This includes the failure to communicate that an
account is disputed. 

The
use of any deceptive means, or false representations to attempt to collect an
account or to obtain information concerning the customer. 

Placing
collect telephone calls to the customer. 

Bringing
legal action against the customer in court purposely chosen to inconvenience or
disadvantage the customer. Assure that local counsel initiates legal action
only in the judicial district in which: 

The
customer signed the contract, or 

The

Attitude
Towards Customers    

Treat all customers in a fair and equitable manner. Delinquent
customers need, and are entitled to receive, helpful assistance in a courteous
manner. This is not only the best way to conduct business, but also the most
effective way to collect delinquent accounts. A customer may overreact to even
the most businesslike collection contact by raising their voice or using
profane language. Never reply in kind.  

An invitation to discuss the delinquency problem with
a supervisory associate may prompt a response that leads to continued payment
on the account thereby avoiding further collection activity.  

If the ASR has a negative attitude, the images are
negative and the results tend to be negative.  

If the ASR has a positive attitude, the reverse tends
to be true. Their attitude determines their images, their images (mental
practice) determines their actions and their actions determine reality.  

The ASR spends a big part of their day talking about
money with people that they have never seen or spoken to before. Contact with
them is brief, and yet they need something important from them   money. In this
kind of delicate situation, the wrong assumptions can cause problems.  

The thing to do after a difficult conversation with a
customer is wall off that call. In other words, do what needs to do to done to
let go of the stress and strain. Do not let if spill over into the next call,
assuming unconsciously that the next customer is going to be just as
uncooperative as the last one.  

Past
Due Notices     

In addition to telephone activity, a well-timed
collection letter can either reinforce previous conversation or begin the
process if there has been no previous contact.  

System Generated Letters     

There are a number of collection letters that
are available for the colector to send out on past due accounts. These letters
have a range of urgency to them, and are generated through our computer system.  

Form Notices and Form Letters    

Several series of printed form letters
designed to fit various types of collection situations are available for use to
reinforce other collection activity and not as a substitute.  

17  

Individually Written Letters    

We should only use pre-approved letters on
company letterhead. Any individually composed letter must be signed by a
department Manager before forwarding to customer.  

Notifying Guarantors, Additional Endorsers, or
Co-Buyers    

Notifying the co-buyer or guarantor of the
default is necessary and should result in strengthening follow-up as the
co-buyer or guarantor would be interested in protecting his/her interest. Every
possible consideration should be extended to the second party. Some states
require written notice to co-buyers and guarantors in order to hold them liable
for the account. See Legal Procedures.  

Pre-Repossession
Notice/Cure Letter    

Depending on individual state regulations (Legal
Procedure), the buyer, as well as the co-buyer/guarantors, if applicable, will
be notified of the right to cure a default by a pre-repossession notice/cure
letter. This will be sent by regular mail unless otherwise specified by state
regulation.  

A Right to Cure letter should be sent immediately once
the account becomes 30 days past due (in all applicable states).  

The customer must be given a period of time (depending
on state regulations) from the date the notice is mailed to cure the default. During
this period, the branch will not:  

Attempt
repossession; 

Take
court action against the customer; 

Accelerate
the balance 

Accounts, which do not respond satisfactorily to the
pre-repossession notice/cure letter, revert to normal handling following
expiration of the specified period.  

Selecting
Accounts for Cure Notice Issuance    

The buyer and co-signer/guarantor should be selected
for pre-repossession notice/cure letter issuance when such notice is required
by state law or when the office believes that the account falls into one of the
following categories:  

FIFS
is aware that the customer is withholding payment because of a product
complaint against the dealer or the manufacturer. 

An
impasse situation is encountered due to the customer s inability to pay and
unwillingness to admit it. 

18  

The
office is unable to contact a customer with previous satisfactory paying
experience. 

The
customer is not a skip hazard, but all previous collection effort has failed to
produce customer payment. The cure notice may cause payment or result in
voluntary surrender of the collateral. 

The
account is chronically delinquent and repossession is considered necessary to
resolve the problem. 

When
the office can no longer tolerate a chronic collection account, a
pre-repossession notice/cure letter warns the customer that FIFS will no longer
accept habitual late payment. The use of the notice will preclude a claim by
the customer that, by accepting previous payments on a late basis, FIFS had
established a pattern of conduct leading the customer to believe that FIFS
should continue to accept late payments without exercising its contractual
remedies. 

To
minimize unnecessary delays, the office should select most accounts for
pre-repossession notice/cure letter issuance during the office phase of
collection activity. (Normally no later than 45 days past due). 

Note  :    The office should avoid the indiscriminate
use of cure letters as a collection tool. 

Customer
Contact    

The automated collection system has many features,
which enhance the daily procedure and routines in retail collections.  

This section will highlight some of these features and
explain how they facilitate customer contact. For further detail or additional
explanation refer to the Collection System Reference Guide.  

It is important to set the tone and gain control of
the collection call by using an opening line that is clear and direct. Your
opening statement sets the tone for the entire call. The ASR should sound
professional, serious and non-threatening.  

The standard greeting on initial contacts is: (after
we have determined that we have a right party contact)  

Mr.
Rodgers, this is Bob Wade with First Investors Financial Services. According to
my records you are past due on your account with us and now due for $500. What
time today can I expect you to send your payment?             **
Pause ***  

When an opening statement is brief, clear and to the
point, your professionalism and the seriousness of the call will be evident.  

19  

Account
Review    

The ASR will review their queue on a daily basis and
attempt to work all accounts. If an account cannot or should not be called by
that ASR, it should be assigned to the individual or party who can contact the
customer.  

Manager and Supervisor reviews   Accounts worked by an
ASR will be randomly selected and reviewed by management staff. These account
reviews will ensure that accounts are being handled by the guidelines set by
this policy manual and departmental standards. These reviews will be completed
on a weekly basis.  

Telephone
Communication Principles    

When the ASR is talking on the telephone, the customer
is forming a mental picture of them. Therefore, it is important that the ASR
get a  smile  into their voice. Remember that the customer is the reason that
we are in business. So, maintain enthusiasm, a positive attitude, and open
mind.  

Pitch   

Speech experts recommend a low pitch because it
  projects   carries better, and is more pleasant.  

Inflection  

Don t talk in monotone - Use feeling to express
  attitude.  

Courtesy  

Common courtesy applies the same as face to face -
  Even more important when on the telephone.  

Tone  

Often it isn t what you say, but how you say it.
  Your voice should reflect sincerity, pleasantness, confidence   interest.  

Understandability  

Avoid talking with anything in your mouth.  

Rate  

The rate of speech should be matched to that of your
  audience. Avoid extremes, either way.  

The telephone is a two-way communication tool, which
has the capacity to provide instant understanding. Listening properly will
help  to fully comprehend our customer s
needs. Do not assume or guess.  

20  

Making
Silence Work to Your Advantage    

The ASR needs to use a pause in their opening
statement in the conversations. They can express this opening statement in many
different ways, but all of them need to be followed by a pause, silence. What
can a collector accomplish through the first pause in the conversation?  First, he communicates through the silence
that the customer is supposed to say something. At this point, the ball is in
the customer s court.  

Second, he gives the customer an opportunity to think
about what the collector has said. Few people can listen and think at the same
time. The silence gives the customer an opportunity to digest what was said and
think of a response.  

Third, the silence enables the collector to avoid
making additional assumptions about the customer.  

Fourth, the ASR silence communicates that he is
willing to listen.  

Finally, the silence tells the customer that the ASR
is comfortable with silence, and that he is in control of the conversation. The
ASR will have greater power over the call if the customer know this from the
start.  

Fact
Finding Questions    

Often in the course of our conversation with the
customer we hear objections to paying or  hard luck stories  on why a customer
cannot pay. The following are some questions to ask the customer to help find a
way to bring the account current.  

Unemployed or Lay-Off   

How long have you been unemployed?  

  If recently unemployed   Have you received your last
paycheck?  

  Are you receiving unemployment?  

  If yes, how often are you receiving the unemployment
checks?  

  Do you have other sources of income?  (Spouse, P/T Job, etc.) 

  Do you have any job prospects?  

  Who can you borrow from? (Family or friends)  

  How are you paying your bills?  (Rent, utilities, car loans, etc.) 

  What are you monthly expenses?  

Overobligated / Medical Bills / IRS   

What has caused the over extension?  

  Is this short term or long term? (Recent repairs short
term, heavy credit card spending long term)  

  Who can you borrow from?  

  Do you have any other sources of income?  

  Are you able to get a P/T job?  Have you applied anywhere?  

21  

Are you past due with other creditors?  

  Have you considered applying for a consolidation loan
for you other bills?  

  If Medical   Is this causing you to miss work?  

  If yes   Are you eligible for government
assistance?  Are you eligible for
disability?  

  IRS   are you set up to pay them monthly?  When will the IRS be paid off?  

  What are your monthly expenses?  

Reduction in income   Long term / Short term   

When do you expect to return to full hours?  

  Do you have any other sources of income?  

  Are you behind with all creditors?  

  Have you looked into CCCS for your other bills?  

  Who can you borrow from?  

  What are your monthly expenses?  

The above fact finding questions are just a few of the
many that can be asked to customers when they are stating they cannot pay on
their bill. Utilizing these questions will help the ASR work with the customer
on arrangements and also to let them know that we want to help them with their
situation. The more information we obtain the better chance we have in
collecting the account.  

Discuss
Budget and Negotiate    

Telephone collecting is sales. The ASR must be
creative and convince the customer why he should pay you and not someone else. The
more imaginative creditor will get the money. The customer must be convinced
that his account is the most important thing right now. If he thinks that he is
just another number to FIFS, he is more likely not to pay. In addition, as in
any other sales interaction, the ASR should never allow his words or your
manner to reflect that slightest uncertainty about the eventual outcome.  

During any of the stages of collecting, an ASR should
be aware of the options other than just getting a payment. Almost any collector
can get one payment out of a customer, but only the truly skillful collector
can help the problem customer back on the road to recovery. Some customers can
be rehabilitated if they are handled with patience and persistence. Others may
never be rehabilitated and must be handled firmly, but persuasively.  

If the ASR is    convinced   
that the customer can not pay you in full, they should work out the best
possible budget with the customer   one that enables the customer to pay you as
quickly as possible.  

The ASR must be specific in making the arrangement. Most
important is the amount the customer can pay. The ASR must have a firm schedule
of payments with definite deadlines. Vague promises will only result in more
follow-up calls. Our goal, of course, is to make the best arrangements possible.
As we work out your agreements or new payment terms, make notes. By doing this,
we will make sure that we have thought of all the important details.  

22  

It is seldom that the ASR gets more than what they ask
for, so they should never start off by asking for a partial payment. Only
consider a partial payment when the customer is having problems. Encourage
partial payments only to prevent the customer from missing a payment entirely. We
want the customer to develop the habit of paying FIFS. Regulation of payments
helps ensure continuation. We do not want the customer to feel the relief, or
benefit, of not paying us anything.  

Definition
of a Promise to Pay:    

An account should be labeled as a Promise to Pay when
the customer makes solid and clear arrangements to pay on their account. The
promise should be the best possible arrangement to assure that the promise is
kept. When setting up arrangements to pay with the customer the ASR should
strive for affordable and reasonable payment arrangements. A reasonable
arrangement would be the best possible payment to work towards paying the debt
off. An affordable arrangement would be a payment that meets our customers
current income needs and would insure that the customer would be able to keep
the promise to pay. Keep in mind that our goal in every conversation is to get
the customer to pay off their account.  

When we talk to the customer and they state that they
will try or might keep the arrangements agreed upon, this would NOT be
considered a promise to pay. When talking to a customer the ASR needs to make
sure that they have firm and solid payment arrangements. The customer should
give the ASR information on the exact date of payment, the method of payment,
and where the funds are coming from. The customer should sound confident when
they agree to a promise amount.  

Account
Update    

Good collection records must be kept for each account.
Even if the ASR has a small volume of accounts, information should be recorded
each and every time a contact, oral or written, is made with the customer.  

People who owe money have a tendency to keep poor
records. Our good collection records indicate to the customer that the ASR is a
professional and intends to be paid. Records give us credibility. The customer
must believe that this debt is the most important matter to FIFS or he will not
take the matter seriously himself.  

When noting an account it is imperative that the ASR
has documented all the information. The following information should be in the
ASRs notes.  

Who   Name of the person you spoke to.  

  What   What are the arrangements?  

  Where   Where will payment be sent?  

  When   When will the payment be made (source of payment,
check, quick collect, etc )?  

  Why   Why is the customer past due?  REASON FOR DELINQUENCY!  

23  

Don ts    

Do not document
personal feelings or opinions in notes. 

                 Do not note any foul
language, put the customer was rude and used foul language. 

                 Do not put verified
information if you in fact did not do so. 

                 Never falsify any
information. 

When contacting a customer; the personal information
should be updated to facilitate future contact. This is to include (as
appropriate) address, phone number, employer name, employee phone number, etc. All
changes must be updated into the retail note system.  

Once contact is made, the ASR should take every
measure to make the current collection call the last collection contact
necessary. To accomplish this, the collector must not only talk about the
delinquent payments plus accumulated late charges, but make it clear to the
borrower that there is no grace period, that the payments are due on the due
date and secure a commitment that future payments will be paid as they mature.  

When collecting the delinquent payment (s), the first
thing the ASR must determine is why the payment(s) have not been made. Once
this reason is determined, the collector will know how to overcome the
objection to payment.  

Set a reasonable period of time when the payment(s)
will be paid and validate the source of funds. It is important when the call is
 closed  that the collector reminds the customer of their commitment. In fact,
the best  close  is to have the customer repeat (in his/her own words) the
promise.  

The customer may refuse to make a payment or suitable
arrangements. When this happens, the customer must be reminded that he/she is
forcing FIFS to  take further collection action  and that until paid, the
delinquency will be reported to the credit bureau. Do not say we will  repossess 
or that we will  ruin the customer s credit .  

When a customer states they are unable to bring the
account completely current or they are candidates for an extension a financial
update should be completed and noted on the system.  

1.                                          Anytime
customer requests an extension you must provide in the notes a complete
financial update for approval. 

2.                                          Anytime
customer states they cannot make their monthly payment and/or bring the account
current, you must complete a financial update in the notes to determine the
recourse for the account. 

Required
Items for a Financial Update:    

Income 

Borrower s Income and Spouses Income  

24  

(Should be their Monthly Net pay)  

  Any other source of Income, child support,
alimony, side work, SSI, etc.  

Mortgage
or Monthly Rent 

Utilities 

Gas, Electric, Water, Garbage, Phone, Cable  

Number
of Dependants ( children they are supporting) 

Food 

Car
Payments (including ours) 

Car
Insurance (listed monthly) 

Medical
Bills 

Installment
Loans / Bank Loans 

Visa,
MasterCard, Discover Credit Card Payments 

Department
Store Credit Card Payments 

Student
Loans 

Miscellaneous
monthly payments 

Cell
phones, pager bills, Internet, etc. 

The collection notes should list the category the
customer is paying and the monthly amount. At the end of notes provide the
following:  

Total
Income subtracted by total monthly expenses, which will equal any extra money
the customer may have for day to day living and savings.   

Special
Conditions    

In most cases, collection follow-up results in payment
and resolution of the customer s delinquency problem. On occasion, however, a
situation may occur when the customer cannot or will not pay. In this case, it
is the responsibility of FIFS collection personnel to initiate any and all
possible corrective actions in a manner acceptable to FIFS according to policy.
Final action, such as repossession, is not to be taken until all other means to
resole have been exhausted. Problems/situations, which are most often the
reason the customer will not or cannot pay, are:  

25  

Disputed
Accounts    

Occasionally, a customer may believe that they no
longer must make payments on their account because of a dispute over the
balance owing, the performance of the collateral, the service of the dealer, or
similar situation. It is FIFS s responsibility to record the Customer Complaint
Report, the details of the dispute and to assist the customer in resolving the
problem promptly. The office must avoid taking severe collection actions, such
as repossession, until the legitimacy of the dispute is determined and all
possible corrective actions have been attempted. As these accounts have high
possibility of legal action in the event we repossess prematurely, approval
must be obtained prior to repossession.  

Customer
Disability or Illness    

If it is determined during the course of collection
follow-up that the customer s delinquency is the result of illness or
disability, ensure that contacts with the customer are in a sensitive and
helpful manner. Do not make commitments regarding a possible insurance claim. Refer
to Procedure 12 for specific instructions.  

Customer
Death    

Whenever it is determined that the customer is
deceased, contact with the representative of the Estate is done in a helpful
and tactful manner. If applicable, let the insurance company involved resolve
any matters regarding a credit life insurance claim. Refer to Procedure 413 for
specific instructions.  

Bankruptcy    

All types of bankruptcies are considered special
situations. See Bankruptcy Administration in Procedure 417 for specific
instructions.  

Litigation    

Litigation is considered to be a special situation
when a suit is actually filed by the customer against FIFS. Refer such cases to
the Legal Department   and take action only a directed by legal counsel.  

Damaged
Collateral    

A customer who becomes delinquent because the vehicle
has been damaged should be advised of their responsibility to continue making
payments. Assist the customer in expediting the insurance claim. If the
collateral is damaged in an accident involving another party, attempt to learn
the identity of the other party and the details of the accident. If the vehicle
is a total loss see Procedure 426, Insurance Total Loss, for proper handling.  

26  

Military    

Customers who enter the armed forces after entering
into a contract with FIFS are entitled to certain rights according to the  Soldiers 
and Sailors  Civic Relief Act . Refer to Procedure 418, Military Personnel, and
Procedure 409, Soldiers  and Sailors  Relief Act, for specific instructions.  

Devastated
Areas    

Occasionally, a specific section of the country will
experience a natural disaster (hurricane, flood, earthquake, etc.) that hinders
customers  ability to pay. First Investors Financial Services policy with
respect to collection from customer resolves itself into observance of
humanitarian principles, and furtherance of customer, dealer and public good
will.  

The office should exercise sound judgment in the
application of this policy and be aware of the opportunity to demonstrate a
desire to be of genuine help for customers at a time when they are in need of
assistance. Personal communication should be established as promptly as
circumstances permit, either by representative or mail, preferably the former. Should
the situation arise, specific instructions for the handling of these accounts
will be issued.  

Product
and Service Compliant    

Occasionally, a customer will claim dissatisfaction
with the product or dealer as a reason to withhold payment from FIFS. In these
instances the associate should:  

Explain
to the customer that FIFS is separate from the manufacturer, and is comparable
to any financial source, which would finance the customer s purchase of the
vehicle. The customer s contractual obligations to FIFS are enforceable,
despite the type of compliant or dispute the customer may have with a
manufacturer or with a dealer. 

Note:   

Before
assigning the account out for repossession, the office should refer to the
procedures concerning specific state laws.   

If
the customer claims that payments will not be made or insurance will not be
maintained for the period of time the customer is without the use of the
vehicle, emphasize to the customer that the responsibility to fulfill all
contractual obligations, including monthly payments and insurance requirements,
remain the customer s responsibility, whether or not the customer has had the
use of the vehicle. 

Indian
Reservation Collection    

When FIFS s collateral is located on an Indian
Reservation and the customer refuses to make payment, determine if the value of
the vehicle warrants repossession. If so, contact our Legal  

27  

department. If not, refer to Procedure 427, Retail
Repossession, for information relating to Abandonment (page 2).  

Collection
Remedies    

Delinquency that cannot be resolved by payment may be
resolved in a number of ways, such as:  

Extension
and Due Date Changes 

                                                Rewrites 

                                                Transfer
of Equity 

All remedies offered should hold a promise for a
permanent solution to the delinquency and should not be offered solely to
improve office collection performance. Repossession is considered only when no
other solution is possible.  

Reporting    

There are numerous reports available daily to
management and supervisors via FIFSNET. These reports include, current
delinquency by portfolio, current delinquency by tier, daily delinquency by
portfolio, summary of days activity, month-over-month comparison of actual
delinquency, month-over-month comparison of potential delinquency,
month-over-month comparison of net potential delinquency, under 30 days past
due delinquency report, delinquency trigger performance, month to date
repossessions, phonepays by pool, phonepays by portfolio, phonepays by date,
extension report, net potential and net roll 30 plus days past due, list of
potential 30 plus days past due accounts, list of month-to-date repossessions,
list of out for repossession accounts, roll to 30 days past due, and phonepays
on the roll.  

Preface   

A customer may occasionally find it difficult to pay
an installment as originally scheduled on the precomputed retail installment
contract. In deserving cases, one or more of the remaining installments may by
extended until the end of the contract (an  Extension ), or the day of each
month on which payments are due may be changed (a  Due Date Change ). The
customer will be required to pay an extension fee (were permitted by law),
prior to the extension being processed. No extensions should be granted that
does not solve the current or future inability of the customer to make payments
and only puts off repossession.  

Simple Interest Contracts   

Finance charges on a simple interest contact accrue on
the outstanding principal balance to the date of payment; therefore, the amount
of the final payment may vary.  

Extensions   

An extension of a contract defers one or more
installments without affecting the due dates on the remaining installments. The
deferred installment (s) are extended to the next due date 30 days  

28  

after the originally scheduled final maturity date. The
due date is automatically extended when an extension is processed.  

A
collector must establish verbal or written contact with the customer. 

                                                The
customer must return to the office a signed Extension Agreement before the loan
can be presented for the extension. 

                                                All
extensions are to be documented by completing an Extension Agreement. 

                                                All
extensions must have a complete financial update for approval noted on the
system. 

                                                The
account must have at least one viable telephone contact number. 

                                                The
customer must have a positive cash balance on the financial update (greater
than zero) 

                                                The
account must be completely updated for all parties listed on loan. Place of
employment must include Company name, address where customer works and
telephone number. 

                                                References
and financial update must redone if 90 days has past since last update. 

                                                An
Extension Packet must be competed. 

                                                The
Extension Packet will include the following; Signed Extension Form by the customer,
Signed Extension checklist by the Collector and Supervisor, Proof of Insurance
(if necessary), any other supporting documentation. 

                                                Customer
must have full coverage auto insurance verified. 

                                                Only
one extension is allowed  for every 12
months of a loans terms.  
                                                  60
months = 5 months extend. 

                                                No
extension can be granted until the first 6 monthly installments are paid 

                                                All
extensions must be approved by a department manager or a high level. 

After the collector offers and completes the necessary
paper work for an extension, they must forward all information to the
Supervisor (signed extension form, signed check sheet, proof of Insurance, any
other supporting documentation). It is the responsibility of the Supervisor to
verify that all the information is competed correctly and accurately. The
Supervisor must verify that the customer is fully aware of the terms of the
extension, the months being extended, and any fees associated with the
extension.  

The Collection Manager must receive the extension
packet that has been signed and approved by the Supervisor before approving any
extension. Once the paper work is received and reviewed by the Collection
Manager he/she will approve or decline the extension. Unless otherwise approved
by the Collections Manager, the account must be brought current (no payment
due) at the time of the extension is granted. If the extension itself does not
bring the account current, a payment and any accumulated late charges must be
collected at the time of the extension. No late charges may be assessed on any
payment amount being deferred.  

Due Date Changes   

The cumulative total of days deferred by all due date
changes processed must not exceed 15 days without Collection Managers approval.  

29  

Only
one due date changes are allowed within the life of the loan. 

                                                The
reason for due date change must be clearly noted on the account. 

                                                A
written request from the customer must be received and place in the customers
permanent file. 

Guidelines
for Extensions and Due Dates Changes    

Reasons
for Granting    

Remedies offered should fit customer and contracts
circumstances and hold a promise for a permanent solution in each case. Do not
adjust payment terms for reasons such as adjusting delinquency ratios or simple
customer preference. If a customer has a legitimate reason for needing a change
in payment terms, consider the following factors before granting the request:  

Customer s
desire and ability to pay 

                                                Past
payment experience 

                                                Condition
of the vehicle 

                                                Customer
equity in the vehicle 

                                                Actual
value of the vehicle 

                                                Date
the next payment will be made. 

                                                Income
source for making the next payment. 

                                                Validity
of reason for request 

Note:   

The
denial of an extension or due date change can under no circumstances be based
upon the race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status or age of
the customer, or on the fact that the customer receives any form of public
assistance income.   

Extension
Authority    

Extensions and Due Date Changes may be granted within
certain limits as prescribed in the  Approval Authority Procedure .  

A Sr. Manager must approve all exceptions to this
policy.  

General
Guidelines     

The following general rules apply to all extensions
and due date changes:  

Customer
must have completed extension agreement 

                                                A
extension can be granted after the first six installments 

                                                An
extension should not be granted if it does not bring the account current. 

                                                The
original maturity of a monthly payment contract cannot be advanced by means of
extensions or due date changes more than 12 months total. 

30  

The
collector must obtain current information for the customer such as place of
employment and telephone number, residence address and telephone number, and a
new customer financial update. The account must have at least one viable
telephone contact number 

                                                Consistent
pay history must be observed after loan is extended. 

                                                Customer
can afford unit; and extension will correct the delinquency, not prolong it. 

An
extension should not be granted if it does not bring the account current.

written consent of the Insurer and the Owner Trustee but without the consent of
the Noteholders and the Depositor, for the purpose of adding any provisions to
or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this
Agreement or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Noteholders;  provided ,
 however , that such amendment shall not, as set forth in an Opinion of
Counsel satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee, materially
and adversely affect the interest of any Noteholder.  This Agreement may also be amended from time
to time by the Issuer, the Administrator and the Indenture Trustee, with the
prior written consent of the Owner Trustee, the Insurer and the Holders of

Agreement without the consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

Insurer Default has not occurred and is not continuing) and the Rating Agency
Condition has been satisfied with respect to such assignment.  An assignment with such consent and
satisfaction, if accepted by the assignee, shall bind the assignee hereunder in
the same manner as the Administrator is bound hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement
may be assigned by the Administrator without the consent of the Issuer, the
Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee to a corporation or other organization
that is a successor (by merger, consolidation or purchase of assets) to the
Administrator;  provided ,  however , that such successor
organization executes and delivers to the Issuer, the Insurer, the Owner
Trustee and the Indenture Trustee an agreement in which such corporation or
other organization agrees to be bound hereunder by the terms of such assignment  

10  

in the same manner as the

assigns of the parties hereto.

Section 15.              Counterparts .  This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts and by different parties on separate counterparts, each of which
shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute but one and
the same instrument.  

Section 16.              Severability .  If any provision of this Agreement shall be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality, and enforceability
of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be affected
or impaired thereby.

Applicable to First Investors Financial Services, Inc. in Other Capacities .  Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any
obligation First Investors Financial Services, Inc. has in any other capacity.

Trustee and Indenture Trustee .  

(a)           Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, this Agreement has been signed by
the Owner Trustee not in its individual capacity but solely in its capacity as
Owner Trustee of the Issuer, and in no event shall the Owner Trustee in its
individual capacity have any liability for the representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements or other obligations of the Issuer hereunder or in any of
the certificates, notices or agreements delivered pursuant hereto or
contemplated hereby, as to all of which recourse shall be had solely to the
assets of the Issuer.  For all purposes
of this Agreement, the Owner Trustee (as such and in its individual capacity)
shall be subject to, and entitled to the benefits of, the Trust Agreement.  

(b)           Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, this Agreement has been
countersigned by the Indenture Trustee not in its individual capacity but

individual capacity have any liability for the representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements or other obligations of the Issuer hereunder or in any of
the certificates, notices or agreements delivered pursuant hereto, as to all of
which recourse shall be had solely to the assets of the Issuer.  

Section 19.              Third-Party
Beneficiary .  The Owner Trustee, in
its individual capacity, and the Insurer are each a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement and each is entitled to the rights and benefits
hereunder and may enforce the provisions hereof as if it were a party hereto.  

Section 20.              Successor
Servicer and Administrator .  The
Administrator shall undertake, as promptly as possible after the giving of
notice of termination to the Servicer of the Servicer s rights and powers
pursuant to Section 5.02 of the Servicing Agreement, to enforce the provisions
of such Section 5.02 with respect to the appointment of a successor Servicer.  Such successor Servicer shall, upon
compliance with Section 5.02 of the Servicing Agreement, become the  

11  

successor Administrator
hereunder;  provided ,  however , that if the Indenture Trustee shall
become such successor Administrator, the Indenture Trustee shall not be
required to perform any obligations or duties or conduct any activities as
successor Administrator that would be prohibited by law and not within the
banking and trust powers of the Indenture Trustee.  In such event, the Indenture Trustee may
appoint a sub-administrator acceptable to the Insurer to perform such
obligations and duties.  

Section 21.              Nonpetition Covenants.   

(a)           Notwithstanding
any prior termination of this Agreement, the Seller, the Administrator, the
Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee shall not, acquiesce, petition or
otherwise invoke knowingly or intentionally cause or encourage the Issuer or

government authority for the purpose of commencing or sustaining a case against
the Issuer or the Depositor under any federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency
or similar law or appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee,
custodian, sequestrator or other similar official of the Issuer or the

or liquidation of the affairs of the Issuer or the Depositor.  

(b)           Notwithstanding
any prior termination of this Agreement, the Issuer, the Administrator, the Owner
Trustee and the Indenture Trustee shall not, acquiesce, petition or otherwise
invoke knowingly or intentionally cause or encourage the Seller to invoke the
process of any court or government authority for the purpose of commencing or
sustaining a case against the Seller under any federal or state bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar law or appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee,
trustee, custodian, sequestrator or other similar official of the Seller or any
substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of
the affairs of the Seller.

thereto.

representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement, the

forth below and is enforceable as such against creditors of and purchasers from
and assignees of the Depositor.  

2.             Each
Contract constitutes  tangible chattel paper  and not  electronic chattel
paper , within the meaning of the Relevant UCC Section 9-102.  

3.             The
Seller has taken or will take all steps necessary actions with respect to the
Contracts to perfect the security interest of the Depositor in the Contracts .  

Creation   

1.             The
Seller owns and has good and marketable title to the Contributed Property, free
and clear of any Lien, claim or encumbrance of any Person, excepting only tax
liens, some mechanics  liens and other liens that arise by the operation of
law, in each case on any of the Financed Vehicles and arising solely as a
result of an action or omission of the related Obligor.  

Perfection   

1.             The
Seller has caused the filing of all appropriate financing statements in the
proper filing office in the appropriate jurisdictions under applicable law in
order to perfect the security interest in the Contributed Property absolutely
contributed to the Depositor under this Agreement.  

2.             With
respect to Contributed Property that constitutes tangible chattel paper, such
tangible chattel paper is in the possession of the Depositor (it being
understood that the Depositor will deliver such tangible chattel paper to the
Custodian and that the Depositor will receive a written acknowledgment from the
Custodian that it is holding such tangible chattel paper solely on its behalf
and for the benefit of the Depositor). 
All financing statements filed or to be filed against the Seller in
favor of the Depositor in connection with this Agreement describing the
Contributed Property contain a statement to the following effect:  A purchase
of or security interest in any collateral described in this financing statement
will violate the rights of the Secured Party.   

Schedule 2-1  

Priority   

1.             Other
than the security interest granted to the Depositor pursuant to this Agreement,
the Seller has not pledged, assigned, sold, granted a security interest in, or
otherwise conveyed any of the Contributed Property.  The Seller has not authorized the filing of,
or is not aware of any financing statements against the Seller that includes a
description of the Contributed Property and proceeds related thereto other than
any financing statement (i) relating to the transfer of the Contracts by the
Seller to the Depositor under this Agreement; or (ii) that has been terminated
or amended to reflect a release of the Contributed Property.  

2.             The
Seller is not aware of any judgment, ERISA or tax lien filings against the
Seller.  

3.             None
of the tangible chattel paper that constitutes or evidences the Contracts has
any marks or notations indicating that it has been pledged, assigned or
otherwise conveyed to any Person other than the Depositor.  

Survival of Perfection Representations   

1.             Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, the Sale and Allocation Agreement, the
Indenture or any other Transaction Document, the Perfection Representations,
Warranties and Covenants contained in this Schedule shall be continuing, and
remain in full force and effect until such time as all obligations under this
Agreement, the Sale and Allocation Agreement and the Indenture have been
finally and fully paid and performed.  

No Waiver   

1.             The
parties hereto: (i) shall not, without obtaining a confirmation of the
then-current ratings of each Class of the Class A Notes (without giving effect
to the Policy), waive any of the Perfection Representations, Warranties or
Covenants; (ii) shall provide the Rating Agencies with prompt written notice of
any breach of the Perfection Representations, Warranties or Covenants, and

breach) waive a breach of any of the Perfection Representations, Warranties or
Covenants.
