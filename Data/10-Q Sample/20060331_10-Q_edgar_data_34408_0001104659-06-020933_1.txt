FAMILY DOLLAR
STORES, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES   

     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

1.                  In the opinion of the Company, the accompanying
unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements contain all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring accruals and including a litigation charge as
described in Note 8 below) necessary to present fairly the Company s financial
position as of February 25, 2006; the results of operations for the second
quarter and first half ended February 25, 2006 ( second quarter and first
half of fiscal 2006 ), and February 26, 2005 ( second quarter and first
half of fiscal 2005  and the cash flows for the first half of fiscal 2006 and
first half of fiscal 2005. For further information, refer to the consolidated
financial statements and footnotes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended August 27, 2005. 

The
results of operations for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2006, are
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.   

Certain reclassifications of the amounts for the
second quarter and first half of fiscal 2005, have been made to conform to
the presentation for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2006.  These
include accounts payable and accrued liabilities, which are now listed
separately, and interest income, which was previously included in selling,
general and administrative expenses.  

The
Company manages its business on the basis of one reportable segment.   

2.                  The Company
considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less to be  cash equivalents.  
The carrying amount of the Company s cash equivalents approximates fair
value due to the short maturities of these investments and consists primarily
of money market funds and other overnight investments. The Company maintains
cash deposits with major banks, which from time to time may exceed
federally insured limits. The Company periodically assesses the financial
condition of the institutions and believes that the risk of any loss is
minimal. 

The items classified as
investment securities are principally auction rate securities and variable rate
demand notes. The Company classifies all investment securities as
available-for-sale. Securities accounted for as available-for-sale are required
to be reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes,
excluded from net income and shown separately as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income within shareholders  equity. The securities that the
Company has classified as available-for-sale generally trade at par and as a
result typically do not have any realized or unrealized gains or losses.  

3.                  The preparation of
the Company s Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and
assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

4.                  The Company had no
current or long-term debt as of the fiscal year ended August 27, 2005. Current
and long-term debt consisted of the following at February 25, 2006: 

On September 27,
2005, the Company obtained $250 million through a private placement of
unsecured Senior Notes (the  Notes ) to a group of institutional accredited
investors. The Notes were issued in two tranches at par and rank   pari passu   in right of payment with the Company s other
unsecured senior indebtedness. The first  

7  

tranche has an aggregate
principal amount of $169 million, is payable in a single installment on September 27,
2015, and bears interest at a rate of 5.41% per annum from the date of issuance.
The second tranche has an aggregate principal amount of $81 million, matures on
September 27, 2015, with amortization commencing in the sixth year, and
bears interest at a rate of 5.24% per annum from the date of issuance. The
second tranche has a required principal payment of $16.2 million on September 27,
2011, and on each September 27 thereafter to and including September 27,
2015. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on the 27th day
of March and September of each year commencing on March 27, 2006.
The sale of the Notes was effected in transactions not requiring registration
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Notes contain certain
restrictive covenants ,
which include a consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization ratio, a fixed
charges coverage ratio, and a priority debt to consolidated net worth ratio. At the end of the second quarter of fiscal
2006, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The proceeds of
the Notes are being used to repurchase the Company s outstanding common stock,
as discussed in Note 5 below. 

In addition to the Notes,
the Company has unsecured revolving credit facilities with banks for short-term
borrowings of up to $200 million. On May 25, 2006, $100 million of the
facilities will expire, and the remaining $100 million will expire on May 31,
2010. The Company expects that the facilities expiring on May 25, 2006,
will be extended. Any borrowings under these facilities are at a variable
interest rate based on short-term market interest rates. The Company had no
borrowings against these facilities during the first half of fiscal 2006 or
during fiscal 2005.  

5.                  During fiscal 2005, the Company purchased in
the open market 3.3 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $92.0
million. On October 4, 2005, the Company executed an overnight share
repurchase transaction with a bank for the acquisition of an additional 10
million shares, or approximately 6%, of the Company s outstanding common stock
for an initial purchase price of $19.97 per share. The transaction was financed
with the proceeds of the Notes, as discussed in Note 4 above. As part of
the overnight share repurchase transaction, the Company simultaneously entered
into a forward contract with the bank that matured on March 6, 2006. In
connection with the forward contract, the bank purchased shares of the Company s
common stock in the open market in order to fulfill its obligation related to
shares it borrowed from third parties and sold to the Company. At the end of
the purchase period, the Company could receive from or pay to the bank a price
adjustment based on the volume weighted average purchase price of the Company s
common stock during the purchase period compared to the initial purchase price.
Such price adjustment could be either in cash or common stock at the discretion
of the Company. On March 9, 2006, at its option, the Company paid $32.7
million in cash to the bank to settle the forward contract. 

The shares repurchased in connection with the
overnight share repurchase transaction were immediately canceled and returned
to the status of authorized but unissued shares. The total cost of the initial
purchase was approximately $201.2 million, including a $1.3 million cap premium
and $0.2 million in commissions and other fees. In accordance with Accounting
Principles Board (APB) Opinion 6,  Status of Accounting Research Bulletins, 
the Company reduced common stock, capital in excess of par, and retained
earnings by approximately $1.0 million, $8.1 million, and $192.1 million,
respectively. In addition, the Company reduced retained earnings by
approximately $0.3 million in connection with a dividend fee paid to the bank
on January 17, 2006. The forward contract associated with the overnight
share repurchase transaction was accounted for in accordance with EITF 00-19,  Accounting
for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a
Company s Own Stock,  as an equity instrument. The $32.7 million payment made
on March 9, 2006, to settle the forward contract will be recorded as an
adjustment to retained earnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The
diluted net income per share calculation for the second quarter and first half
of fiscal 2006 assumed that the forward contract would be settled through the
issuance of additional shares of common stock as no final decision had been
made by the Company as to the nature of the settlement as of February 25,
2006.  

There were no other purchases
of common stock during the first half of fiscal 2006. Shares are purchased
pursuant to share repurchase authorizations approved by the Board of Directors.
As of February 25, 2006, the Company had outstanding authorizations to
purchase a total of approximately 7.7 million shares, consisting of
approximately 3.8 million shares (based on the closing share price) remaining
under the authorization for $300 million of stock repurchases approved by the
Board of Directors on August 19, 2005, and approximately 3.9 million
shares remaining pursuant to authorizations approved by the Board of Directors
prior to August 19, 2005. Shares purchased prior to the end of fiscal 2005
under the share repurchase authorizations are held in treasury or  

8  

have been reissued under the
Family Dollar 2000 Outside Directors Plan. Shares purchased with the proceeds
of the Notes are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued
shares.  

6.                  At the Company s
Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on January 19, 2006, the Company s
shareholders approved the Family Dollar Stores, Inc. 2006 Incentive Plan
(the  2006 Plan ). The 2006 Plan permits the granting of a variety of
compensatory award types. The Company currently grants non-qualified stock options
and performance share rights under the plan. Prior to the adoption of the 2006
Plan, the Company issued non-qualified stock options under the Company s 1989
Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan (the  1989 Plan ). As a result of the adoption
of the 2006 Plan, no further awards can be granted under the 1989 Plan. Shares
issued under the 2006 Plan represent new issuances of common stock. A total of
12.0 million common shares are reserved and available for issuance under the
2006 Plan, plus any shares awarded under the 1989 Plan that expire or are
cancelled or forfeited after January 19, 2006. As of February 25,
2006, there were 11.8 million remaining shares available for granting under the
2006 Plan. 

Effective August 28,
2005, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised
2004)  Share-Based Payment  ( SFAS 123R ) for its stock-based compensation
plans. Under SFAS 123R, all stock-based compensation cost is measured at the
grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an
expense in the income statement over the requisite service period. On March 29,
2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) staff issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 107 to express the views of the staff
regarding the interaction between SFAS 123R and certain SEC rules and
regulations and to provide the staff s views regarding the valuation of
stock-based compensation arrangements for public companies. The SAB 107
guidance was taken into consideration with the implementation of SFAS 123R.  

Prior to August 28,
2005, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic
value method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees  ( APB 25 ), and related Interpretations, as permitted by
the original provisions of SFAS 123,  Share-Based Payment.   The Company did not record compensation
expense under APB 25 since the exercise price of the stock options equaled the
fair market value of the underlying common stock on the grant date. The Company
instead utilized the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 148,  Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure.   

The Company adopted SFAS
123R using the modified prospective transition method. Under the modified
prospective transition method, the Company is required to record stock-based
compensation expense for all awards granted after the adoption date and for the
unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding on the adoption date.
Compensation cost related to the unvested portion of previously granted awards
is based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
provisions of SFAS 123. Compensation cost for awards granted after the adoption
date is based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS 123R. Results for prior periods have not been restated and
do not reflect the recognition of stock-based compensation.  

The Company has elected to
adopt the alternative transition method, as permitted by FASB Staff Position No. FAS
123R-3  Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of
Share-Based Payment Awards,  to calculate the tax effects of stock-based
compensation pursuant to SFAS 123R for those employee awards that were
outstanding upon adoption of SFAS 123R. The alternative transition method
allows the use of simplified methods to calculate the beginning capital in
excess of par pool related to the tax effects of employee stock-based
compensation and to determine the subsequent impact of the tax effects of
employee stock-based compensation awards on the capital in excess of par pool
and the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows. Prior to the adoption
of SFAS 123R, the Company reported all tax benefits resulting from the exercise
of stock options as operating cash flows in the Consolidated Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows. SFAS 123R requires cash flows resulting from the tax
deductions in excess of the related compensation cost recognized in the
financial statements (excess tax benefits) to be classified as financing cash
flows. In accordance with SFAS 123R, excess tax benefits recognized in periods
after the adoption date have been properly classified as financing cash flows. Excess
tax benefits recognized in periods prior to the adoption date are classified as
operating cash flows.  

As a result of the
adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company s results for the second quarter and first
half of fiscal 2006 include stock-based compensation expense of $1.9 million
and $3.4 million, respectively. These amounts  

9  

are included within
selling, general, and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Condensed
Statements of Income. Tax benefits recognized during the second quarter and
first half of fiscal 2006 were immaterial.  

The following table
illustrates the effect on net income and net income per share if the Company
had adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 during the second
quarter and first half of fiscal 2005:  

The Company s stock option
plans contain retirement provisions, effective January 20, 2005, that
allow employee stock options to continue to vest after retirement without
requiring additional service. The retirement provisions apply to all non-vested
stock options as of the effective date, all vested stock options that were  underwater 
(i.e. the options had an exercise price in excess of the market value of the
stock) on the effective date, and all new options granted thereafter. Under
SFAS 123R, compensation cost should be recognized over the shorter of the
stated vesting period or the period from the grant date to the retirement
eligibility date, if the employee is able to retire without providing
additional service. For awards granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the
Company recognizes compensation cost over the stated vesting period. If the
Company had accounted for these awards in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS 123R, compensation expense would have been $1.9 million higher for both
the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2005 (for pro-forma disclosure
purposes only) and would have had an immaterial impact for the second quarter
and first half of fiscal 2006.  

Stock Options   

The Company grants stock
options to key employees at prices not less than fair market value on the grant
date. Options expire five years from the grant date and are exercisable to the
extent of 40% after the second anniversary of the grant and an additional 30%
at each of the following two anniversary dates on a cumulative basis. Compensation
cost is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over
the requisite service period. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model to estimate the grant-date fair value of each option granted before and
after the adoption of SFAS 123R. The fair values of options granted during the
second quarter and first half of fiscal 2006 were estimated using the following
weighted-average assumptions:  

The expected dividend
yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share divided by
the stock price on the grant date. Expected stock price volatility is derived
from an analysis of the historical and implied volatility of the Company s
publicly traded stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S.
Treasury rates on the grant date with maturity dates approximating the expected
life of the option on the grant date. The expected life of the options is based
on an analysis of historical and expected future exercise behavior, as well as
certain demographic characteristics. These assumptions are evaluated and
revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and experience.  There
were no material changes made to the methodology used to determine the  

10  

assumptions during the second quarter of
fiscal 2006.  The weighted-average grant-date fair values of stock
options granted during the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2006 were
$6.54 and $5.47, respectively. The following table summarizes the transactions
under the stock option plan during the first half of fiscal 2006: 

The total intrinsic value of stock options
exercised during the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2006 was
immaterial. As of February 25, 2006, there was approximately $11.2 million
of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding stock options. The
unrecognized compensation cost will be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 1.4 years.  

Performance Share Rights   

During the second quarter
of fiscal 2006, the Company began granting performance share rights to key
employees. Performance share rights give employees the right to receive shares
of the Company s common stock at a future date based on the Company s
performance relative to a peer group. Performance is measured based on two
pre-tax metrics: Return on Equity and Income Growth. The Compensation Committee
of the Board of Directors establishes the peer group and performance metrics. The
performance share rights vest at the end of the performance period (generally
three years) and the shares are issued shortly thereafter. The actual number of
shares issued can range from 0% to 200% of the employee s target award
depending on the Company s performance relative to the peer group.  

During the second quarter
of fiscal 2006, the Company granted 0.2 million performance share rights to
employees at a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $24.07. The grant-date
fair value of the performance share rights is based on the stock price on the
grant date. Compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of
estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period and adjusted quarterly
to reflect the ultimate number of shares expected to be issued.  As of February 25,
2006, there was approximately $5.2 million of unrecognized compensation cost
related to outstanding performance share rights, based on the Company s most
recent performance analysis. The unrecognized compensation cost will be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. None of the performance
share rights vested during the second quarter of fiscal 2006.  

7.                  Basic net income per common share is computed
by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
during each period. Diluted net income per common share gives effect to all securities
representing potential common shares that were dilutive and outstanding during
the period. The exercise prices for certain of the outstanding stock options
that the Company has awarded exceed the average market price of the Company s
common stock. Such stock options are antidilutive (options for 5.3 million and
5.4 million for the quarter and first half ended February 25, 2006,
respectively, and options for 1.9 million and 2.0 million for the quarter and
first half ended February 26, 2005, respectively) and were not included in
the computation of diluted net income per share. In the calculation of diluted
net income per common share, the denominator includes the number of additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if the Company s outstanding
stock options and performance share rights had been exercised. In addition, for
the quarter and first half ended February 25, 2006, the denominator
includes the number of additional common shares that could have been issued to
settle the Company s forward contract related to the overnight share repurchase
transaction. 

11  

The
following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per
common share:   

8.                    On January 30, 2001, Janice Morgan and Barbara Richardson, two
individuals who have held the position of Store Manager for subsidiaries of the
Company, filed a Complaint against the Company in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Alabama. Thereafter, pursuant to the Court s
ruling, notice of the pendency of the lawsuit was sent to approximately 13,000
current and former Store Managers holding the position on or after July 1,
1999. Approximately 2,550 of those receiving such notice filed consent forms
and joined the lawsuit as plaintiffs, including approximately 2,300 former
Store Managers and approximately 250 then current employees. After rulings by
the Court on motions to dismiss certain plaintiffs filed by the Company and
motions to reconsider filed by plaintiffs, 1,424 plaintiffs remained in the
case at the commencement of trial.  

The
case has proceeded as a collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ).
The Complaint alleges that the Company violated the FLSA by classifying the
named plaintiffs and other similarly situated current and former Store Managers
as  exempt  employees who are not entitled to overtime compensation.   

A
jury trial in this case was first held in June 2005, in Tuscaloosa,
Alabama and ended with the judge declaring a mistrial after the jury was unable
to reach a unanimous decision in the matter. The case was retried to a jury in
Tuscaloosa, Alabama commencing on February 21, 2006. On March 3,
2006, the jury in this trial found that the Company should have classified the
Store Manager plaintiffs as hourly employees entitled to overtime pay rather
than as salaried exempt managers and awarded damages in the amount of
approximately $19.1 million. The Court has under submission the issue of the
Company s good faith and could double the $19.1 million damages award if it
determines that the Company did not act in good faith in classifying the
plaintiffs as employees exempt from overtime payments. The Court also has under
submission the Company s motion to dismiss certain plaintiffs  claims due to
their failure to list such claims in personal bankruptcy proceedings which, if
granted, could reduce the amount of the damage award. In addition, the Company
anticipates that the plaintiffs  counsel will request and the Court may approve
an award of attorneys  fees to the plaintiffs  counsel in an amount to be
determined. Although the Company plans to appeal the judgment, as a result of
these matters, the Company recognized $45 million as a litigation charge (exclusive
of the Company s related legal defense costs) in its second quarter with
respect to this litigation. This charge will not have any impact on cash flow
while the Company pursues its appellate rights with respect to this judgment as
the Company does not expect to be required to pay the amount of the judgment during
the appellate process.   

In general, the Company
continues to believe that the Store Managers are  exempt  employees under the
FLSA and have been properly compensated and that the Company has meritorious   

12   

grounds
for an appeal of this judgment. However, the outcome of any litigation is
inherently uncertain. Resolution of this matter could have a material effect on
the Company s financial position, liquidity or results of operation.   

The
Company is involved in numerous other legal proceedings and claims incidental
to its business, including litigation related to alleged failures to comply
with various state and federal employment laws. While the ultimate outcome
cannot be determined, the Company currently believes that these proceedings and
claims, both individually and in the aggregate, should not have a material
adverse effect on the Company s financial position, liquidity or results of
operations. However, the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain and,
if decided adversely to the Company, the Company may be subject to
liability that could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial
position, liquidity or results of operations.   

9.        Subsequent Events: 

As discussed in Note 8
above, the Company received an adverse jury verdict on March 3, 2006,
associated with a case in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Since the events that gave rise
to the litigation occurred prior to the balance sheet date, the Company
recorded the estimated $45.0 million litigation charge in the second quarter of
fiscal 2006.  

As
discussed in Note 5 above, the Company paid $32.7 million in cash to a bank on March 9,
2006, to settle its forward contract associated with the overnight share
repurchase transaction. The settlement of the forward contract will be recorded
as an adjustment to retained earnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2006.

Item 2. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

This discussion summarizes the
significant factors affecting the consolidated results of operations and
financial condition of the Company for the thirteen-week periods ended February 25,
2006, and February 26, 2005 ( second quarter of fiscal 2006  and  second
quarter of fiscal 2005 , respectively) and the twenty-six-week periods ended February 25,
2006, and February 26, 2005 ( first half of fiscal 2006  and  first half
of fiscal 2005 , respectively). This discussion should be read in conjunction
with, and is qualified by, the financial statements included in this quarterly
report and the financial statements for the fiscal year ended August 27,
2005, ( fiscal 2005 ) and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) contained in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2005.   

This discussion contains
forward-looking statements subject to the Cautionary Note Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements set forth following this MD A.   

Results of Operations    

2006 First Half Results and Fiscal 2006 Outlook   

During the first half of fiscal 2005, the Company
began the implementation of four key initiatives designed to increase sales and
profitability: the installation of refrigerated coolers in selected stores; the
introduction of a  Treasure Hunt  merchandise program; the continuation of an
aggressive store opening program; and the Urban Initiative. During the fiscal
year ending August 26, 2006, ( fiscal 2006 ), the Company will continue
these initiatives as discussed below.  

Coolers   The installation of refrigerated coolers for the sale of
perishable food began in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The customer
traffic generated by coolers has increased sales of food and other merchandise
throughout the store. At the end of fiscal 2005, refrigerated coolers were
installed in approximately 1,000 stores. The Company plans to install
refrigerated coolers in approximately 2,500 additional stores by the end of
fiscal 2006. In addition, the Company is developing a broader food strategy, a part of
which involves testing new point-of-sale software in a limited number of stores
to facilitate the acceptance of food stamps in stores with refrigerated coolers.
At the end of the first half of fiscal 2006, approximately 2,000 stores had
refrigerated coolers for the sale of perishable food. 

                                     Treasure Hunt  merchandise program   During fiscal 2005, the Company
began supplementing its basic assortment of merchandise with additional
opportunistically purchased goods designed to create more excitement in stores
throughout the year, with particular emphasis on holidays, spring and
back-to-school seasons, and to balance gross margin pressure from increased
sales of lower margin consumables. During fiscal 2006, the Company is taking a
more process-oriented approach to this initiative by focusing on three key
components: identifying and selecting exciting values for customers; informing
customers of the compelling values through circulars and in-store handouts and
signage; and effectively displaying the items in stores to attract customer
attention. 

                                    New Stores   During fiscal 2005, the Company opened 500 stores and
closed 68 stores, with a substantial percentage of the new store openings
occurring in the last months of the fiscal year. In order to build processes
that will support a more balanced distribution of store openings throughout the
year, the Company plans to open approximately 400 stores and close
approximately 65 stores in fiscal 2006. During the first half of fiscal 2006,
the Company opened 160 stores and closed 56 stores. 

                                    Urban Initiative   The Urban Initiative is designed to improve the
operating performance of high sales volume stores in large metropolitan markets
through investments in people, process changes and technology, including
organizational changes to support a more mobile and flexible workforce. During
fiscal 2005, the Urban Initiative was implemented in approximately 1,200 stores.
While the Urban Initiative stores experienced solid comparable store sales
growth and continued to be profitable during fiscal 2005, the Company s
profitability goals were not achieved. For fiscal 2006, the Company will
continue its investments in the current Urban Initiative markets (approximately
1,400 stores at the end of the first half of fiscal 2006) but does not expect
to expand the initiative into new markets until processes have been refined to
generate improved results. The Company is focused on three primary goals:  improving financial returns, reducing
inventory shrinkage and increasing store manager retention. During the first
half of fiscal 2006, the Company saw an improvement in profitability in most
Urban Initiative markets, resulting from positive trends in comparable store
sales and improvements in inventory shrinkage  

14  

in the stores that implemented the Urban Initiative
first in fiscal 2005.  

During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Hurricanes
Katrina, Rita and Wilma struck the U.S. Gulf Coast and Florida, impacting
numerous stores in the afflicted areas. Since the Company s stores are widely
dispersed, lost sales due to closed stores resulting from damage or power
outages were generally limited and continue to be substantially offset by
increased sales in other stores. The most significant storm-related losses were
related to the loss of merchandise inventories, furniture and fixtures and
leasehold improvements at individual stores in the paths of the storms. The
Company expects the majority of the losses incurred will be covered by
insurance. During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company received an
initial payment from its insurance carrier for a portion of these claims. The
net impact of these storms has not had and is not expected to have a material
impact in the aggregate on the Company s financial position, liquidity or
results of operations.  

Fiscal 2006 Outlook   

  Based on operating results for the first half of
fiscal 2006, as discussed below, and the Company s plans for the remainder of
the year, the Company currently expects diluted net income per common share to
be between $1.19 and $1.24 for fiscal 2006, compared to $1.30 in fiscal 2005. The diluted net income per common share
guidance for fiscal 2006 includes the impact ($0.18 per diluted share) of an
adverse litigation judgment, as discussed in the Company s Second Quarter
Results and Year-to-date Results below and Note 8 to the Consolidated Condensed
Financial Statements included in this Report. The diluted net income per
common share guidance for fiscal 2006 also includes the impact of the expensing
of stock-based compensation as required by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards ( SFAS ) No. 123R,  Share-Based Payment,  and other new
compensation programs, the interest expense related to the Company s debt
placement, and the accretive benefit of the Company s share repurchase program.
See Note 6 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included in this
Report and the Selling, General and Administrative Expenses section in
this MD A for more information on SFAS 123R and its impact. See the
Liquidity and Capital Resources section in this MD A for more
information on the Company s share repurchase program and related debt
placement.  

Second Quarter Results and Third Quarter Outlook   

Net
Sales    

  Net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 were
$1.7 billion, an increase of approximately 9.4% ($148.9 million), as compared
with an increase of 13.1% ($184.0 million) in the second quarter of fiscal 2005.
The increase was attributable, in part, to increased sales in comparable stores
(stores open more than 13 months) of 3.2% ($49.5 million), with the balance of
the increase primarily relating to sales from new stores opened as part of
the Company s store growth program. The comparable store sales calculation for
the second quarter of fiscal 2006 excludes a limited number of stores that were
closed for an extended period of time as a result of the hurricanes as
discussed above. The solid sales
performance during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 was driven primarily by
the installation of refrigerated coolers, the Urban Initiative and the  Treasure
Hunt  merchandise program. Sales of lower-margin basic consumables continued to
be stronger than sales of higher-margin discretionary goods during the second
quarter of fiscal 2006, reflecting the difficult economic environment,
including higher energy prices, faced by the Company s low and lower-middle
income customer base. However, holiday sales of higher margin items along with
favorable sales trends in the home department helped offset substantially all
of the negative effect of the sales of lower margin items.  

The 3.2% increase in comparable store sales during
the second quarter of fiscal 2006 includes an increase of approximately 4.9% in
the sales of hardline merchandise and a decrease of approximately 3.6% in the
sales of softline merchandise. In the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the
customer count, as measured by the number of register transactions in
comparable stores, decreased approximately 1.0%, and the average transaction
increased approximately 4.2% to $10.28. Recent research from an independent
market research group suggests that low-income customers have reduced their
total shopping frequency, combining trips and errands in response to higher
gasoline prices. The Company s declining customer count trends and increasing
transaction size during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 are consistent with
this research. Increased sales of hardline merchandise have been the primary
contributor to the overall sales increases. Hardline merchandise, as a
percentage of net sales, increased to approximately 80.1% in the second quarter
of fiscal 2006 compared to approximately 78.7% in the second quarter of fiscal
2005. Softline merchandise, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to
approximately 19.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to
approximately 21.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2005.  

15  

The
Company distributed two advertising circulars in the second quarter of fiscal
2006, compared with one advertising circular in the second quarter of fiscal
2005. The circulars are designed to stimulate traffic and inform customers
about the Company s  Treasure Hunt  merchandise, seasonal values and competitive
prices on core consumables.  

Hardline
merchandise includes household chemical and paper products, candy, snacks and
other food, health and beauty aids, electronics, housewares and giftware, pet
food and supplies, toys, stationery and school supplies, seasonal goods,
hardware and automotive supplies. Softline merchandise includes men s, women s,
boys , girls  and infants  clothing, shoes, and domestic items such as
blankets, sheets and towels.   

The
average number of stores in operation during the second quarter of fiscal 2006
was 7.3% higher than the average number of stores in operation during the
second quarter of fiscal 2005.   

T he Company currently expects comparable store
sales to increase 4% to 6% during the third quarter of fiscal 2006 as a result
of the ongoing rollout of refrigerated coolers, the impact from  Treasure Hunt 
merchandise sales and the operational improvements resulting from the Urban
Initiative program. 

Cost of Sales   

  Cost of sales increased approximately 9.3% in the
second quarter of fiscal 2006 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2005. This
increase primarily reflected the additional sales volume between years. Cost of
sales, as a percentage of net sales, decreased slightly to 67.1% in the second
quarter of fiscal 2006, compared with 67.2% in the second quarter of fiscal
2005. As a percentage of net sales,
transportation expense, markdown expense, merchandise mix, and inventory
shrinkage in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 were all relatively unchanged
compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Higher year-over-year fuel
costs were offset by transportation productivity and efficiency savings, as
well as savings from an overall reduction in shipments resulting from better
inventory management. Sales of higher margin items during the holiday season
and favorable sales trends in the home area mitigated the negative impact from
sales of lower-margin basic consumables. While the favorable inventory
shrinkage trend experienced in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 slowed during
the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the stores that implemented the Urban
Initiative first in fiscal 2005 have reported significantly lower inventory
shrinkage results. The Company expects to continue its focus in this area in an
effort to reduce inventory shrinkage.  

During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company
expects that cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, will increase as
compared to fiscal 2005 due to the continuing effect of the shift in the
merchandise mix to more lower-margin basic consumables.  

Selling, General and
Administrative Expenses    

  Selling, general and administrative ( SG A )
expenses increased 10.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2006, compared with
the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The increases in these expenses were due
primarily to additional costs arising from the continued growth in the number
of stores in operation. SG A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were
25.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2006, compared with 24.9% in the second
quarter of fiscal 2005. The increase in
the percentage for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 was due primarily to
increased occupancy costs (approximately 0.6% of net sales) and increased
compensation expense related to the expensing of stock-based compensation as
required by SFAS 123R and other compensation programs (approximately 0.2% of
net sales). The increase in occupancy costs was due primarily to higher utility
costs and higher depreciation charges, especially as it relates to the urban
markets. Partially offsetting these increases were decreases in store payroll
expenses (approximately 0.3% of net sales) and insurance costs (approximately
0.1% of net sales). Refinements in the Urban Initiative and improvements in the
store payroll allocation process enabled the Company to reduce store payroll
expenses, as a percentage of net sales. The percentage decrease in insurance
costs is primarily due to a corresponding reduction in health care claims.  

During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company
expects SG A expense, as a percentage of net sales, to increase slightly as
compared to fiscal 2005 due to higher occupancy costs, the expanded rollout of
the cooler program and the continued investments in the existing Urban
Initiative markets. In addition, the required expensing of stock-based
compensation and other compensation plan changes, as discussed in the Company s
2006 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement, is expected to increase SG A expenses,
as a percentage of net sales.  

16  

Litigation Charge    

   During the second quarter of
fiscal 2006, the Company recorded a $45.0 million ($0.18 per diluted share)
litigation charge associated with an adverse litigation judgment in a case in
Tuscaloosa, Alabama.    The jury in this particular case found that the Company
should have classified a number of its store managers as hourly employees
entitled to overtime pay rather than as salaried managers. The Company believes
that it is correct in classifying its store managers as salaried managers and
plans to appeal the verdict.   See Note 8 to the Consolidated
Condensed Financial Statements included in this Report for more information. All
other legal expenses during the second quarter of both fiscal 2006 and fiscal
2005, including the Company s defense costs related to the above-referenced
case, were recorded in SG A.  

Interest Income    

   The increase in interest income
during the second quarter of fiscal 2006, compared with the second quarter of
fiscal 2005 was due to an increase in interest rates and investments.   

Interest Expense    

  On September 27, 2005, the Company obtained
$250 million in aggregate proceeds through a private placement of unsecured
Senior Notes (the  Notes ) to a group of institutional accredited investors. During
the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company incurred $3.0 million in
interest expense related to the Notes. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Condensed
Financial Statements included in this Report for information on the Company s
current and long-term debt. The Company did not incur any interest expense
during fiscal 2005.  

Provision for Taxes on Income    

  The effective tax rate was
37.0% for the second quarter of fiscal 2006, compared with 36.7% for the second
quarter of fiscal 2005.  For
the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company s plan is for the effective tax
rate to remain at 37.0%, but could be negatively impacted if a retroactive
reinstatement of certain federal jobs tax credits for employees hired after December 31,
2005 does not occur. 

Net Income and Earnings Per Share   

  Net income for the second
quarter was $54.5 million compared with net income of $80.1 million for the
second quarter of fiscal 2005. Included in the results for the second quarter
of fiscal 2006 is a litigation charge of $28.4 million, net of taxes,
associated with an adverse litigation judgment in a case in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
See Note 8 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included in this
Report for more information.   

Diluted net income per
common share was $0.35 in the second quarter of fiscal 2006, compared with
$0.48 in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The decrease in diluted net income
per common share is due to the decrease in net income as discussed above,
partially offset by the accretive benefit of the Company s share repurchase
program.  The Company
currently expects diluted net income per common share to be between $0.33 and
$0.36 for the third quarter of fiscal 2006. 

Year-to-date Results   

Net
Sales    

  Net sales in the first half of fiscal 2006 were $3.2
billion, an increase of approximately 9.4% ($280.1 million), as compared with
an increase of 12.1% ($319.5 million) in the first half of fiscal 2005. The
increase was attributable, in part, to increased sales in comparable stores
(stores open more than 13 months) of 3.1% ($89.7 million), with the balance of
the increases primarily relating to sales from new stores opened as part of
the Company s store growth program. The comparable store sales calculation for
the first half of fiscal 2006 excludes a limited number of stores that were
closed for an extended period of time as a result of the hurricanes as
discussed above. The solid sales
performance during the first half of fiscal 2006 was driven primarily by the
installation of refrigerated coolers, the Urban Initiative and the  Treasure
Hunt  merchandise program. Sales of lower-margin basic consumables continued to
be stronger than sales of higher-margin discretionary goods during the first
half of fiscal 2006, reflecting the difficult economic environment, including
higher energy prices, faced by the Company s low and lower-middle income
customer base. However, certain categories of discretionary goods, such as toys
and electronics, as well as home products and higher margin seasonal items
performed well.  

The 3.1% increase in comparable store sales during
the first half of fiscal 2006 includes an increase of approximately 4.6% in the
sales of hardline merchandise and a decrease of approximately 2.6% in the sales
of  

17  

softline
merchandise. In the first half of fiscal 2006, the customer count, as measured
by the number of register transactions in comparable stores, decreased
approximately 1.6%, and the average transaction increased approximately 4.6% to
$9.83. Increased sales of hardline merchandise have been the primary
contributor to the overall sales increases. Hardline merchandise, as a
percentage of net sales, increased to approximately 80.0% in the first half of
fiscal 2006 compared to approximately 78.9% in the first half of fiscal 2005. Softline
merchandise, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to approximately 20.0% in
the first half of fiscal 2006 compared to approximately 21.1% in the first half
of fiscal 2005. The Company distributed three advertising circulars in the
first half of fiscal 2006 and two advertising circulars in the first half of
fiscal 2005. The circulars are designed to stimulate traffic and inform customers
about the Company s  Treasure Hunt  merchandise, seasonal values and
competitive prices on core consumables.  

The average number of stores in operation during the
first half of fiscal 2006 was 7.5% higher that the average number of stores in
operation during the first half of fiscal 2005. The Company had 6,002 stores in
operation at the end of the first half of fiscal 2006, compared with 5,600
stores in operation at the end of the first half of fiscal 2005, representing
an increase of approximately 7.2%.   

Cost of Sales   

  Cost of sales increased approximately 9.2% in the
first half of fiscal 2006 compared with the first half of fiscal 2005. This
increase primarily reflected the additional sales volume between years. Cost of
sales, as a percentage of net sales, decreased slightly to 66.8% in the first
half of fiscal 2006, compared with 66.9% in the first half of fiscal 2005. The
slight decrease in cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, during the
first half of fiscal 2006 was due primarily to the favorable impact of lower
inventory shrinkage and improved initial mark-ups. The initiatives the Company
has implemented to address inventory shrinkage are having a positive impact,
but the Company expects to continue to focus its efforts in this area. These
improvements were offset by higher freight costs resulting from higher fuel
costs. The opening of the Company s eighth distribution center in Marianna,
Florida, in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 and its continued ramp-up have
positively impacted freight costs by lowering the average distance to the
stores from the distribution centers. Increases in transportation productivity
and efficiency, as well as a reduction in shipments resulting from better
inventory management have also offset some of the cost increases. However,
these savings did not fully offset the impact of higher year-over-year fuel
costs. The Company expects that the opening of the ninth distribution center in
Rome, New York, during the third quarter of fiscal 2006 will continue to lower
the average distance to the stores from the distribution centers and will
positively impact freight costs.  

Selling, General and
Administrative Expenses    

  SG A expenses increased 11.9% in the first half
of fiscal 2006, compared with the first half of fiscal 2005. The increases in
these expenses were due primarily to additional costs arising from the
continued growth in the number of stores in operation. SG A expenses, as a
percentage of net sales, were 26.6% in the first half of fiscal 2006, compared
with 26.0% in the first half of fiscal 2005. The increase in the percentage for
the first half of fiscal 2006 was due primarily to increased occupancy costs
(approximately 0.5% of net sales), increased insurance costs (approximately
0.1% of net sales) and increased compensation expense related to the expensing
of stock-based compensation as required by SFAS 123R and other compensation
programs (approximately 0.2% of net sales). The increase in occupancy costs was
due primarily to higher utility costs and higher depreciation charges,
especially as it relates to urban markets. The increase in insurance costs was
primarily a result of a limited number of large claims in the health care and
workers  compensation areas as well as some hurricane related costs, offset
slightly by a reduction in health care claims during the second quarter of
fiscal 2006. These increases were
partially offset by a reduction in store payroll expenses (approximately 0.2%
of net sales). Refinements in the Urban Initiative and improvements in the
store payroll allocation process enabled the Company to reduce store payroll
expenses, as a percentage of net sales.  

Litigation Charge    

   During the first half of fiscal
2006, the Company recorded a $45.0 million ($0.18 per diluted share) litigation
charge associated with an adverse litigation judgment in a case in Tuscaloosa,
Alabama.    The jury in this particular case found that the Company
should have classified a number of its store managers as hourly employees
entitled to overtime pay rather than as salaried managers. The Company believes
that it is correct in classifying its store managers as salaried managers and
plans to appeal the verdict.   See Note 8 to the  

18  

Consolidated Condensed Financial
Statements included in this Report for more information. All other legal
expenses during the first half of both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, including
the Company s defense costs related to the above-referenced case, were recorded
in SG A.   

Interest Income    

   The increase in
interest income during the first half of fiscal 2006, compared with the first
half of fiscal 2005 was due to an increase in interest rates and investments.   

Interest Expense    

  On September 27, 2005, the Company obtained
$250 million in aggregate proceeds through the private placement of the Notes
to a group of institutional accredited investors. During the first half of
fiscal 2006, the Company incurred $5.1 million in interest expense related to
the Notes. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements
included in this Report for information on the Company s current and long-term
debt. The Company did not incur any interest expense during fiscal 2005.  

Provision for Taxes on Income    

  The effective tax rate was
37.0% for the first half of fiscal 2006, compared with 36.5% for the first half
of fiscal 2005. A retroactive reinstatement of certain federal jobs tax credits
for employees hired after December 31, 2003, favorably impacted the
effective tax rate in the first half of fiscal 2005.  

Net Income and Earnings Per Share   

  Net income for the first
half of fiscal 2006 was $105.9 million compared with net income of $134.5
million for the first half of fiscal 2005. Included in the results for the
first half of fiscal 2006 is a litigation charge of $28.4 million, net of
taxes, associated with an adverse litigation judgment in a case in Tuscaloosa,
Alabama. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included
in this Report for more information.   

Diluted net income per
common share was $0.67 in the first half of fiscal 2006, compared with $0.80 in
the first half of fiscal 2005. The decrease in diluted net income per common
share is due to the decrease in net income as discussed above, partially offset
by the accretive benefit of the Company s share repurchase program.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources    

At the end of the first half of fiscal 2006, the Company
had working capital of $553.4 million, compared with $460.2 million as of August 27,
2005. Changes in working capital during the first half of fiscal 2006 and
fiscal 2005 were primarily the result of earnings, changes in merchandise
inventories and capital expenditures. The Company s inventories at the end of
the first half of fiscal 2006 were 6.6% higher than at the end of the first
half of fiscal 2005. Inventory on a per store basis at the end of the first
half of fiscal 2006 was flat compared with inventory on a per store basis at
the end of the first half of fiscal 2005 while overall softline inventory was approximately 7% lower.  

Capital
expenditures for the first half of fiscal 2006 were approximately $97.8 million
and are currently expected to be approximately $210 million to $230 million for
fiscal 2006. The majority of the planned capital expenditures for fiscal 2006
relate to the Company s new store openings; existing store expansions,
relocations and renovations; construction of distribution centers; expenditures
related to store-focused technology infrastructure; and the continued
implementation of a refrigerated cooler program for perishable goods in
selected stores. The new store expansion and new distribution centers also
require additional investment in merchandise inventories.   

In
the first half of fiscal 2006, the Company opened 160 stores, closed 56 stores
and expanded, relocated, or renovated 20 stores. The Company plans to open
approximately 400 stores and close approximately 65 stores during fiscal 2006. The
Company also plans to relocate, expand, or renovate approximately 75 stores
during fiscal 2006. The Company occupies most of its stores under operating
leases. Store opening, closing, expansion, relocation, and renovation plans, as
well as overall capital expenditure plans, are continuously reviewed and are
subject to change.   

During fiscal
2005 the Company purchased in the open market 3.3 million shares of its common
stock at a cost of $92.0 million. On September 27, 2005, the Company obtained
$250 million in aggregate proceeds through the private placement of the Notes
to a group of institutional accredited investors. On October 4, 2005,  

19  

the Company executed an overnight share
repurchase transaction with a bank for the acquisition of 10 million shares, or
approximately 6%, of the Company s outstanding common stock for an initial
purchase price of $19.97 per share. The transaction was financed with the
proceeds of the Notes.  As
part of the overnight share repurchase transaction, the Company
simultaneously entered into a forward contract with the bank that matured on March 6,
2006. In connection with the forward contract, the bank purchased shares of the
Company s common stock in the open market in order to fulfill its obligation
related to shares it borrowed from third parties and sold to the Company. At
the end of the purchase period, the Company could receive from or pay to the
bank a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average purchase price of
the Company s common stock during the purchase period compared to the initial
purchase price. Such price adjustment could be either in cash or common stock
at the discretion of the Company. On March 9, 2006, at its option, the Company
paid $32.7 million in cash to the bank to settle the forward contract.  See Note 4 and Note 5
to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included in this Report for
more information. The shares repurchased in connection with the overnight share
repurchase transaction were immediately canceled and returned to the status of
authorized but unissued shares. There were no other purchases of common stock
by the Company during the first half of fiscal 2006.  As of February 25, 2006, the Company had
outstanding authorizations to purchase a total of approximately 7.7 million
shares, consisting of approximately 3.8 million shares (based on the closing
share price) remaining under the authorization for $300 million of stock
repurchases approved by the Board of Directors on August 19, 2005, and
approximately 3.9 million shares remaining pursuant to authorizations approved
by the Board of Directors prior to August 19, 2005. The Company plans to
continue common stock purchases utilizing a 10b5-1 program. 

The Company
has unsecured revolving credit facilities with banks for short-term borrowings
of up to $200 million. On May 25, 2006, $100 million of the facilities will
expire, and the remaining $100 million will expire on May 31, 2010. The Company
expects that the facilities expiring on May 25, 2006, will be extended. The
Company had no outstanding borrowings against these facilities during the first
half of fiscal 2006 or during fiscal 2005. Cash flow from current operations
and available revolving credit facilities, as discussed above, are expected to
be sufficient to meet planned liquidity and operational capital resource needs,
including store expansion and other capital spending programs, scheduled
interest payments, and any further repurchase of the Company s common stock.  

The following table shows the Company s obligations
and commitments as of the end of the second quarter of 2006 to make future
payments under contractual obligations:  

Most of the Company s operating leases
provide the Company with an option to extend the term of the lease at
designated rates.  

The following table shows the Company s other
commercial commitments as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2006:  

20  

At the end of the second quarter
of fiscal 2006, approximately $28.9 million of the merchandise letters of
credit were included in accounts payable on the Company s Consolidated
Condensed Balance Sheet. A substantial portion of the outstanding amount of
standby letters of credit and surety bonds (which are primarily renewed on an
annual basis) are used as surety for future premium and deductible payments to
the Company s workers  compensation and general liability insurance carrier. The
Company accrues for these future payment liabilities as described in the  Critical
Accounting Policies  section of this discussion.   

Critical Accounting Policies    

Management believes the following
accounting principles are critical because they involve significant judgments,
assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Company s
consolidated condensed financial statements.   

Merchandise Inventories:    

Inventories are valued using the retail method,
based on retail prices less markon percentages, which approximates the lower of
first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market. The Company records adjustments to
inventory through cost of goods sold when retail price reductions, or
markdowns, are taken against on-hand inventory. In addition, management makes
estimates and judgments regarding, among other things, initial markups,
markdowns, future demand for specific product categories and market conditions,
all of which can significantly impact inventory valuation. If actual demand or
market conditions are different than those projected by management, additional
markdowns may be necessary. This risk is generally higher for seasonal
merchandise than for non-seasonal goods. The Company also provides for
estimated inventory losses for damaged, lost or stolen inventory for the period
from the physical inventory to the financial statement date. These estimates
are based on historical experience and other factors.  

Property
and Equipment:    

Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation
for financial reporting purposes is calculated using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. For leasehold
improvements, this depreciation is over the shorter of the term of the related
lease (generally five years) or the asset s useful economic life. The valuation
and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable
lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates. The Company
generally assigns no salvage value to property and equipment. Property and
equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Historically, impairment losses on fixed assets have not been material
to the Company s financial position and results of operations.  

Insurance Liabilities:   

The Company is primarily self-insured for health
care, property loss, workers  compensation and general liability costs. These
costs are significant primarily due to the large number of the Company s retail
locations and employees. Because the nature of these claims is such that there
can be a significant lag from the incurrence of the claim (which is when the
expense is accrued) until payment is made, the percentage increase in the
accrual can be much more pronounced than the percentage increase in the expense.
The Company s self-insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs
of claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported, less amounts
paid against such claims, and are not discounted. Management reviews current
and historical claims data in developing its estimates. The Company also uses
information provided by outside actuaries with respect to workers  compensation
and general liability claims. If the underlying facts and circumstances of the
claims change or the historical trend is not indicative of future trends, then
the Company may be required to record additional expense or a reduction to
expense which could be material to its reported financial condition and results
of operations.  

21  

Lease Accounting:   

The Company leases substantially all of its store
properties and accounts for store leases in accordance with SFAS 13,  Accounting
for Leases.   For purposes of recognizing
incentives, premiums and minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over
terms of the leases, the Company uses the date of initial possession to begin
amortization, which is generally when the Company enters the space and begins
to make improvements in preparation of intended use. For tenant improvement
allowances and rent holidays, the Company records a deferred rent liability at
the inception of the lease term and amortizes the deferred rent over the terms of
the leases as reductions to rent expense on the Consolidated Statements of
Income.  

Stock-based Compensation Expense   

The Company adopted SFAS 123R during the first
quarter of fiscal 2006. SFAS 123R requires the measurement and recognition of
compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees based on
estimated fair values. The determination of the fair value of the Company s
stock options on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by
the Company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex
and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the
expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and
projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. If factors change and the
Company employs different assumptions in the application of SFAS 123R in future
periods, the compensation expense recorded under SFAS 123R may differ
significantly from the amount recorded in the current period.  

Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements    

Certain statements contained in this Report, or in
other public filings, press releases, or other written or oral communications
made by the Company or its representatives, which are not historical facts are
forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking
statements address the Company s plans, activities or events which the Company
expects will or may occur in the future and may include express or
implied projections of revenue or expenditures, statements of plans and
objectives for future operations, growth or initiatives, statements of future
economic performance, or statements regarding the outcome or impact of pending
or threatened litigation. These forward-looking statements may be
identified by the use of the words  plan,   estimate,   expect,   anticipate,   probably, 
 should,   project,   intend,   continue,  and other similar terms and
expressions. Various risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause the
Company s actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied
in any forward-looking statements. Factors, uncertainties and risks that may result
in actual results differing from such forward-looking information include, but
are not limited to those listed below, as well as other factors discussed
throughout this Report, including, without limitation, the factors described
under  Critical Accounting Policies.   

Success of merchandising and marketing programs   

The Company undertakes new programs and refines
existing programs to increase net sales and its customer base. The Company may be
adversely impacted if merchandise and marketing programs fail to attract
customers into its stores or if the merchandising programs implemented by the
Company are not attractive to its customers.  

Unusual weather or natural disasters that may impact sales and or
operations   

Extreme changes in weather patterns or other natural
disasters influence customer trends and purchases. Likewise, weather patterns
and natural disasters may negatively impact sales and/or operations of the
Company.  

Competitive factors   

The Company is in a highly competitive sector of the
discount retail merchandise sector with numerous competitors, some of whom may have
greater resources than the Company. The Company competes for customers,
merchandise, real estate locations and employees. This competitive environment
subjects the  

22  

Company
to various risks, including the ability to continue its store and sales growth
and provide attractive merchandise to its customers at competitive prices that
allow the Company to maintain its profitability.  

Pricing pressures, including inflation and energy prices   

Increases in the cost of goods and services,
including changes resulting from inflationary pressures, may reduce the
Company s profitability and/or sales. The Company s ability to pass on
incremental pricing changes may be limited due to operational and/or
competitive factors. Increases in prices, including changes in energy prices, may impact
the Company s customer base by limiting the amount of discretionary spending of
its customers and may impact the Company through increased costs of goods
and/or increased operating expenses.  

Changes in consumer demand and product mix; and changes in overall
economic conditions   

A general slowdown in the U.S. economy may adversely
affect the spending of the Company s customers, which may result in lower
net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis. In addition, changes in
the types of products made available for sale and the selection of the products
by customers affect sales, product mix and margins. Future economic conditions
affecting disposable consumer income, such as employment levels, business
conditions, fuel and energy costs, interest rates, and tax rates, could also
adversely affect the Company s business by reducing spending or causing
customers to shift their spending to other products.  

The impact of acts of war or terrorism and transportation and
distribution delays or interruptions   

Significant acts of terrorism, existing U.S.
military efforts, as well as the involvement of the U.S. in other military
engagements, could have an adverse impact on the Company by, among other
things, disrupting its distribution or information systems, causing dramatic
increases in fuel prices which increase the cost of doing business, or impeding
the flow of imports or domestic products to the Company. Delays or interruptions
in the transportation and distribution of products could have an adverse impact
on the Company.  

Merchandise supply and pricing and the interruption of and dependence
on imports   

The Company has generally been able to obtain
sufficient quantities of attractive merchandise at prices that allow the
Company to profitably sell such merchandise. Any disruption in that supply
and/or the pricing of such merchandise could negatively impact the Company s
operations and results. A significant amount of the goods sold by the Company
are imported, and changes to the flow of these goods for any reason could have
an adverse impact on the Company.  

Delays associated with building and opening of distribution facilities
and stores and costs of operating distribution facilities and stores   

The Company maintains a network of distribution
facilities in its geographic territory and constructs new facilities to support
its growth. In addition, the Company expands its network of stores through
opening new stores and remodeling existing stores each year. Delays in opening
distribution facilities or stores could adversely affect the Company s future
operations by slowing growth, which may in turn reduce revenue growth. Adverse
changes in the cost to operate distribution facilities and stores, such as
changes in labor, utility, and other operating costs, could have an adverse
impact on the Company. Adverse changes in inventory shrinkage at the
store-level or in distribution facilities could have a negative impact on the
Company.  

Operational difficulties   

The Company s stores are decentralized and are
managed through a network of geographically dispersed management personnel. Inability
of the Company to effectively and efficiently operate its stores, including the
ability to control losses resulting from inventory shrinkage, may negatively
impact the Company s sales and/or margin. In addition, the Company relies upon
its distribution and logistics network to provide goods to stores in a timely
and cost-effective manner; any disruption, unanticipated expense or operational
failure related to this  

23  

process
could negatively impact store operations. Finally, the Company s operations are
facilitated by the use of various technologies, the disruption or failure of
which could negatively impact the Company s operations.  

Higher costs, potential problems and achievement of targeted results
associated with the implementation of new programs, systems and technology,
including supply chain systems, store technology, cooler installations and
related food programs, Urban Initiative programs, and real estate expansion
goals   

The Company is undertaking a variety of operating
initiatives as well as infrastructure initiatives. The failure to properly
execute any of these initiatives could have an adverse impact on the future
operating results of the Company.  

Changes in state or federal legislation or regulations, including the
effects of legislation and regulations on wage levels and entitlement programs;
changes in currency exchange rates, trade restrictions, tariffs, quotas and
freight rates   

Unanticipated changes in federal or state wage
requirements or other changes in workplace regulation could adversely impact
the Company s ability to achieve its financial targets. Because a substantial
amount of the Company s imported merchandise comes from China, a change in the
Chinese currency policy could negatively impact the Company s merchandise costs.
Changes in trade restrictions, new tariffs and quotas, and higher shipping
costs for goods could also adversely impact the ability of the Company to
achieve anticipated operating results.  

Success of new store opening program   

The Company s growth is dependent on both increases
in sales in existing stores and the ability to open new stores. Unavailability
of store locations that the Company deems attractive, delays in the acquisition
or opening of new stores, difficulties in staffing and operating new store
locations and lack of customer acceptance of stores in expanded market areas
all may negatively impact the Company s new store growth, the costs
associated with new stores and/or the profitability of new stores.  

The Company s ability to attract and retain employees, and changes in
health care and other insurance costs   

The growth of the Company could be adversely
impacted by its inability to attract and retain employees at the store
operations level, in distribution facilities, and at the corporate level,
including the Company s senior management team. Adverse changes in health care
costs could also adversely impact the Company s ability to achieve its
operational and financial goals and to offer attractive benefit programs to its
employees.  

Adverse impacts associated with legal proceedings and claims   

The Company is a party to a variety of legal
proceedings and claims, including those described elsewhere in this Report. Operating
results for the Company could be adversely impacted if such legal proceedings
and claims result in the Company s obligation to make either material damage or
settlement payments or changes to the operation of the business.  

All of the forward-looking statements made by the
Company in this Report and other documents or statements are qualified by these
and other factors, risks and uncertainties. Readers are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the
date of this Report. The Company does not undertake to publicly update or
revise its forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make
it clear that projected results expressed or implied in such statements will
not be realized.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

The Company is subject to market risk from exposure
to changes in interest rates based on its financing, investing and cash
management activities. The Company maintains unsecured revolving credit
facilities at variable interest rates to meet the short-term needs of its
expansion program and seasonal inventory increases.  

24  

The
Company had no outstanding borrowings against these facilities during the first
half of fiscal 2006. The Company s long-term debt associated with the Notes
bears interest at fixed rates.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

Based on an evaluation by
management of the Company (with the participation of the Company s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer), as of the end of the period
covered by this report, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) were
effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in reports that the Company files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) rules and
forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  

The Company is continuously seeking to improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of its operations and of its internal controls. This
results in refinements to processes throughout the Company. However, there has
been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting
during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over
financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item 1. Legal
Proceedings   

The information in Note 8 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial
Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of the Form 10-Q is
incorporated herein by this reference.   

Item 2. Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds   

The following table sets forth information with
respect to purchases of shares of the Company s common stock made during the
quarter ended February 25, 2006, by or on behalf of the Company or any  affiliated
purchaser  as defined by Rule 10b-18(a)(3) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934:  

(1)             Includes amounts converted to shares using the Company s closing stock
price as of the end of each fiscal month. 

  (2)             Does not reflect the $32.7 million cash payment made on March 9,
2006, to settle the forward contract associated with the overnight share
repurchase transaction. 

As previously reported, on October 4,
2005, the Company executed an overnight share repurchase transaction with a
bank for the acquisition of 10 million shares, or approximately 6%, of the
Company s outstanding common stock. The transaction was financed with the
proceeds of the Company s Notes. Under the terms of the overnight share
repurchase transaction, the bank purchased shares in the open market to fulfill
its obligations related to shares sold to the Company.  Such purchases by the bank included purchases
during the quarter ended February 25, 2006. 
See Note 4 and Note 5 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements
included in this Report for more information. There were no other purchases of
common stock by the Company during the first half of fiscal 2006. Shares are
purchased pursuant to share repurchase authorizations approved by the Board of
Directors.    As of February 25, 2006, the
Company had outstanding authorizations to purchase a total of approximately 7.7
million shares, consisting of approximately 3.8 million shares (based on the
closing share price) remaining under the authorization for $300 million of
stock repurchases approved by the Board of Directors on August 19, 2005,
and approximately 3.9 million shares remaining pursuant to authorizations
approved by the Board of Directors prior to August 19, 2005.   Shares
purchased prior to the end of fiscal 2005 under the share repurchase
authorizations are held in treasury or have been reissued under the Family
Dollar 2000 Outside Directors Plan. Shares that are purchased with the proceeds
of the Notes are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued
shares. There is no expiration date governing the period during which the
Company can make share repurchases pursuant to the above referenced
authorizations. There are no other repurchase programs under which the Company
is authorized to repurchase outstanding shares.
