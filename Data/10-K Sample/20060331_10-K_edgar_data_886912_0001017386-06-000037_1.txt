ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL BUSINESS HISTORY

Zunicom,  Inc.  ("Zunicom"  or the  "Company"  or  "we")  operates  through  two
wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  Universal  Power Group,  Inc.  ("UPG") and AlphaNet
Hospitality Systems, Inc. ("AlphaNet").

Zunicom,  Inc., formerly Tech Electro  Industries,  Inc., was incorporated under
the laws of the State of Texas on January 10, 1992, for the purpose of acquiring
100% of the capital stock of Computer Components  Corporation,  a distributor of
electronic  components  incorporated  in 1968.  On October 29,  1996,  Universal
Battery  Corporation  was  incorporated  for the purpose of  expanding  into new
markets for  batteries  and  battery-related  products.  In May 1999,  Universal
Battery  Corporation  merged into Computer  Components  Corporation.  In January
2004,  Computer  Components  Corporation  changed its name to Universal  Battery
Corporation.  Subsequently,  in May 2004,  Universal Battery Corporation changed
its  name  to  Universal   Power  Group  to  better  reflect  its  growth,   and
diversification into portable power products, value-added supply chain and third
party logistics services.

UPG's  operations  encompass  the  distribution  and sale of portable  power and
related synergistic products, third party fulfillment and supply chain services,
and value-added custom battery pack assembly and kitting services.

On October 26, 1999,  Zunicom completed the acquisition of AlphaNet  Hospitality
Systems,  Inc., to gain an entry into the information technology and hospitality
related business sector.  AlphaNet is a leading provider of guest  communication
services to the hospitality industry.

BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

ZUNICOM, INC. ("Zunicom")

General

Zunicom,  through its  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  UPG, is a leading  provider of

3
 
third party logistics and supply chain  services,  batteries,  related  portable
power  products,  security  products to multiple  industries,  and,  through its
wholly-owned  subsidiary,  AlphaNet, is a key provider of business communication
services to the hospitality industry.

UNIVERSAL POWER GROUP, INC. ("UPG")

General

UPG is a full service  sourcing,  sales, and distribution  company  specializing
globally  in third  party  logistics  services  and  delivering  portable  power
products.  UPG offers quality and value-priced batteries and related products to
customers across multiple industries including automotive, consumer, industrial,
marine,   medical,    mobility,   OEM,   security,    telecommunications,    and
uninterruptible power supply ("UPS").

UPG's operations consist of sourcing, procurement, sales and/or distribution of:

         o     batteries, custom  battery  packs, battery chargers, and  related
               accessories;

         o     synergistic  portable  power products, such as jump-starters, and
               12-volt power accessories;

         o     security  products,  such  as  access  controls,  horns,  sirens,
               speakers, transformers, and related installation components;

         o     electro-magnetic devices,capacitors,relays and passive electronic
               components; and

               and engineering design solutions.

UPG Services

Sourcing & Procurement

UPG has significant long-term relationships with vendors located in Taiwan, Hong
Kong, China, Korea and Japan. These relationships,  many exceeding a decade, are
managed by UPG and its  consultants,  who have extensive  expertise in importing
batteries,  portable  power  accessories,  and related  products.  Through these
established  relationships,  UPG  has  the  capability  to  effectively  procure
products  according to customer needs including  "hard-to-find"  items to obtain
lower  project  and  product  costs and to offer a wide and  expanding  range of
synergistic portable power solutions such as chargers and 12-volt accessories.

Distribution

UPG's primary  distribution center is located in Carrollton,  Texas, a suburb of
Dallas,  Texas,  and a designated  Foreign  Trade Zone.  UPG also  benefits from
Carrollton's  Triple  Freeport  Exemption from local tax  authorities on certain
inventory  brought  into  Carrollton  and then  reshipped  out of Texas within a
specified  period.  One hour  behind the East  Coast and two hours  ahead of the
West, Carrollton's location in the Central Time Zone extends the working day for

4
 
companies doing business on both coasts. UPG's prime location allows easy access
to national and international  markets, and enables UPG to facilitate efficient,
quick delivery and fulfillment of products to customers nationwide.

UPG also has a distribution  center located in Oklahoma  City,  Oklahoma,  which
provides another  distribution  point to support additional and varying customer
needs. As an expansion to UPG's wholesale distribution  business,  this location
also  serves as a retail  store  offering  many  types of UPG  branded  consumer
batteries including cellular and cordless phone batteries. UPG expects to set up
similar distribution centers parallel to this same model in the near future.

Enhanced Third-Party Logistics & Supply Chain Services("3PL")

UPG's  customized  comprehensive  3PL solution  offers  companies the ability to
outsource the  complexities  of sourcing,  procurement,  warehousing,  inventory
control, staging, custom kitting, and distribution.

UPG currently  provides this service for Brinks Home  Security  ("Brinks").  UPG
purchases  the  required  inventory  and then  distributes  products  related to
security  installations from UPG's distribution  center to Brinks branches.  UPG
then bills and collects from those branches.

UPG's 3PL  services  help  customers  optimize  performance  by taking  over all
logistical  matters,  which provides customers with measurable resource and cost
savings and increased overall efficiency.

Value-Added Services

UPG offers value-added custom battery pack,  kitting,  marketing and engineering
design assistance services for product lines, such as battery,  battery assembly
systems, security and battery powered products.

As an example,  UPG adds value to products and  components by packaging  them in
customer  specified  "kits" or  tailor-made  units that are  convenient  for the
customer to order.  UPG may  purchase,  in bulk  quantities,  batteries,  wiring
harnesses,  control panels and similar items  necessary to install a residential
security system.  Each security system  installation may require only one or two
of the items  purchased  in bulk by UPG. As a value added  service UPG will pick
the small  quantities of components from the bulk supply and repackage them into
a single shippable unit for the convenience of UPG's customer.  UPG then markets
and sells the single  shippable  unit as a complete  product to their  customer.
This  arrangement is available to many of UPG's customers but the single largest
customer is Brinks.

Additionally,  UPG has several customers that require specific battery solutions
for inclusion in their own  products.  UPG will obtain the battery and necessary
components   and  configure  a  new  finished  good  unit  based  upon  customer
specifications. UPG refers to this process as a "value-added service".

UPG has the ability to design and assemble  custom  battery packs  consisting of
assembled groups of batteries combined  electrically into a single unit. We have
specialized  equipment such as electric welders,  sonic welders,  computer-aided
design  programs,   computer-driven   battery   analyzers,   battery   chargers,
heat-shrink ovens and strip-chart  recorders to support custom assembly,  design
and engineering needs.

5
 
UPG  is  also  a   Panasonic   Authorized   Modification   Center   that  builds
custom-designed battery packs comprised of Panasonic batteries for customers.

In addition to providing the services  necessary to produce  battery packs,  UPG
supplies materials such as wiring,  connectors,  and casings.  Completed battery
packs are assembled to order in nearly all instances. However, UPG does maintain
a broad  inventory of various  sizes of  batteries  and  components  utilized in
battery pack production to serve immediate customer needs.

UPG Products

Batteries

UPG is a leading  distributor of sealed lead acid batteries and its products are
sold to original equipment  manufacturers  ("OEM"s),  distributors and retailers
for   applications   such   as   marine,    medical   mobility,   UPS   systems,
telecommunications and security equipment.

Battery types that UPG carries  include  sealed  lead-acid  Absorbent  Glass Mat
("AGM"),  sealed lead-acid Gel,  nickel-cadmium,  lithium, nickel metal hydride,
alkaline and carbon-zinc batteries.

In addition,  UPG sells and distributes a range of UPG branded  batteries called
Universal  Battery(TM),  Universal(TM),  Adventure Power(R), and Adventure Power
Marine(TM).  UPG  private  labels  for many large  customers  such as Home Depot
Supply,  RadioShack, and others. Further, UPG sells and distributes a broad line
of industrial as well as consumer-retail  batteries for Panasonic.  UPG is fully
equipped to handle a range of private label needs.

UPG continues to develop new battery sizes for varying applications depending on
customer and market needs.  To date,  UPG's  battery  offerings  serve  multiple
industries including automotive, consumer, industrial, marine, medical mobility,
OEM, security, telecom, and UPS.

Portable Power Products

UPG sells and  distributes  a wide range of  portable  power  products  to OEMs,
distributors and retailers.  UPG's line of jump-starters  called  Starter-Up(TM)
and  Starter-Up  Marine(TM),  are  portable  sources  of  12-volt  DC power used
primarily as emergency  starting  power sources on failed  automobile and marine
batteries.  These jump-starters may be used to power many accessories  including
cellular phones,  laptops and radios.  UPG's jump-starters are sold to retailers
such as RadioShack, Bass Pro Shop and Cabela's.

UPG has also added its own expanding  12-volt DC Accessory  line which  includes
electric  auto  jacks,   impact  wrenches,   handheld   vacuums,   cordless  air
compressors, warmers/coolers, spotlights, electric mugs and others.

Security Products

In line with UPG's  third  party  fulfillment  agreement  with  Brinks,  UPG has
expanded  its  product  range to  include a  complete  line of  residential  and
commercial  security products  including  transformers,  sirens,  horns,  access
controls, and related products.

6
 
UPG continues to actively review sources for new and innovative  products to add
to its spectrum of offerings.

Electronic Components and Other Products

UPG imports and sells  electronic  components such as resistors  carbon or metal
film, capacitors of varying types and relays for use in the manufacture, repair,
and modification of electronic equipment.

EQUIPMENT

UPG  owns  the  majority  of the  equipment  used  in its  design  and  assembly
operations.  UPG  owns the  computer  hardware  and  software  required  for its
accounting,  sales,  inventory  and  management  and the  office  furniture  and
equipment as  necessary  to operate its  business.  This  equipment  consists of
readily  available  items  and  can be  replaced  without  significant  cost  or
disruption to business activities.

CUSTOMERS

UPG's customer base is relatively  broad and UPG maintains and continues to grow
a database  consisting  of thousands of existing and  potential  customers.  UPG
actively  participates  in  industry  trade  shows  as a part  of its  continued
marketing effort to actively create brand awareness and generate new leads.

However,  UPG has had two  significant  customers  during the past three  years.
Brinks  accounted  for 55%,  51% and 50%,  respectively,  of UPG's  revenues for
fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003. Schumacher Electric Corporation accounted for 10% of
UPG's revenue for fiscal 2003. The loss of Brinks as a customer would materially
decrease UPG's total revenue.

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2005, UPG's workforce consisted of 58 full-time employees.

SALES & MARKETING

UPG's sales efforts are  supported by a direct sales force of 12,  outside sales
representatives of 24, and in-house customer service representatives of 9.

UPG also markets its products and services by actively participating in industry
tradeshows throughout the year.

UPG has  undertaken  minimal  advertising  in  trade  publications,  though  UPG
foresees  pursuing more advertising  avenues  including direct mail,  additional
trade and magazine publications, and online advertising.

TECHNOLOGY

UPG believes that its electronic  products are not affected by rapidly  changing
technology  since they  represent  basic  elements  common to a wide  variety of
existing electronic circuit designs. At the same time, there can be no assurance
that  advances and changes in  technology,  manufacturing  processes,  and other
factors will not affect the market for UPG's products.

7
 
COMPETITION

UPG competes in the sale of its batteries and battery packs with many  companies
located  in the  United  States,  Mexico  and Asia.  In the sales of  electronic
components,  UPG faces  competition  from many  large  electronic  distributors,
factory direct sales outlets,  other importers  throughout the United States and
exporters in Asia.  In the sale of UPG's 3PL and value added  services,  many of
UPG's competitors are substantially  larger and have greater  resources.  UPG is
able to compete on the basis of breadth  of product  offering,  price,  quality,
product innovation and service.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

UPG  believes  that it complies  with all  relevant  federal,  state,  and local
environmental  regulations and does not expect to incur any significant costs to
maintain compliance with such regulations in the foreseeable future.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

UPG does not own or use any patent  rights.  UPG does,  however have  registered
trademark  rights  over the UB  Scootin(R)  and  Adventure  Power(R)  marks.  In
addition,  UPG utilizes the following trade names in connection with its battery
and portable power products: Universal Battery(TM), Universal(TM), and Adventure
Power  Marine(TM).  UPG  believed  that  these  marks are  important  and assist
customers in recognizing UPG's products.

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS

UPG has established relationships with overseas battery manufacturers from which
it purchases its products.  These  manufacturers  are  responsible for providing
product to the Company's  specifications.  Shortages or increased  prices in raw
material  components  such as lead and  copper  used in battery  production  can
impact the Company's  ability to maintain  adequate  stock levels at competitive
prices.   One  of  UPG's  largest  overseas   suppliers  is  located  in  China,
representing   approximately   22%  of  UPG's  product  purchases  during  2005.
Additionally, UPG has one supplier, Ademco, a Division of Honeywell Corporation,
that  provided  approximately  44%  of  UPG's  product  purchases  during  2005.
Substantially all products  purchased from Ademco are used to fulfill orders for
Brinks security  installations.  The loss of either of these  relationships  may
have a material effect on UPG's business.

For value-added  custom battery pack assembly needs, UPG purchases raw materials
such as wire,  metals and packaging  materials,  from a number of local sources,
and is not dependent on any single source for raw materials.

Except as noted above,  UPG believes that the loss of any single supplier of raw
materials would not adversely affect its business.

GOVERNMENTAL MATTERS

Except for usual and customary business licenses, permits and regulations, UPG's
business is not subject to governmental regulations or approval of its products.

Internet.  With  WaveLan(TM),  the hotel can offer wireless  internet  access to
their  guests in any  number of  locations  including  lobbies,  meeting  rooms,
lounges, bars and restaurants.

InnFax(TM) provides for in-room faxing,  copying and printing through the use of
the IBC 5000  multifunction  machine.  While still actively installed in several
major hotels  within the USA,  InnFax(TM)  is a  technology  that is not in high
demand  by  the  business  traveler.  In-room  Internet  is  the  key  competing
technology  that has eroded usage of this service.  The Company has reviewed the
operations of InnFax(TM) and  restructured  the product  offering to reflect the
continuing decline.

EQUIPMENT

The hardware and software  necessary for The Office(TM) product line is obtained
from brand name manufacturers  including Brother, HP, Cherry and Viewsonic.  The
Pentium P4 class PCs are assembled  in-house using  best-of-class  components to
ensure  reliability  and  durability  as is  required  for 24/7  operation.  The

9
 
Office(TM)  software  allows for virus and artifact free operation for each user
and tracks usage statistics for billing purposes.

AlphaNet embraces new technologies and products to provide users with the latest
available  in  the  market.  Innovations  such  as  cost-effective  color  laser
multifunction machines provide hotels economical ways to offer color printing to
its guests.

CUSTOMERS

AlphaNet sells or places its product line to both chain/management companies and
individual  properties.  AlphaNet  provides  services  to chains such as Hilton,
Hyatt, Intercontinental, Marriott, Westin and Fairmont. Individual properties of
note include New York Palace, Waldorf-Astoria,  Fairmont Dallas, Westin Michigan
Avenue  Chicago,  Intercontinental  Dallas  and the newly  renovated  Hilton San
Francisco Financial District.

AlphaNet  has been  selected  as a  preferred  Hilton  vendor.  It is  currently
involved in the roll-out of business  centers at many Hilton  properties as part

as-needed  basis to provide  on-site field support in key regions within the USA
and Canada.

SALES AND MARKETING

AlphaNet  sells or places  its  products  and  services  through  direct  sales.
AlphaNet's  sales effort is supported by extensive use of highly targeted direct
mailings as well as intensive telephone  follow-up.  AlphaNet typically exhibits
and/or attends two major industry trade shows each year.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

AlphaNet has patent rights over the InnFax(TM)  technology,  whereby  individual
fax machines work in concert with communications networks. Although these patent
rights have been of value and are expected to be of value in the future,  in the
opinion of management,  the loss of any single patent right would not materially
affect the conduct of the  business in any of the product  lines.  In  addition,
management  believes that the  likelihood of losing key patent rights is remote.
AlphaNet also utilizes the following  trade names for its products:  InnFax(TM),
The Office(TM),  WaveLan(TM),  Laptop Connect(TM), and GuestPrint(TM).  Alphanet
believes  that  these  trademarks  are  important  in  assisting   customers  in
recognizing Alphanet products.

COMPETITION

AlphaNet's The Office(TM) product has several established competitors.  AlphaNet
competes  through  service,  pricing and  marketing to their large,  established
customer  base.  Innovation,  such as being the first to offer  small foot print
business  centers (which have now become  standard),  helps AlphaNet  maintain a
competitive advantage in the market.

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES

AlphaNet  relies  upon the  facilities  and  services of various  telephony  and
communications  common carriers.  The product  components used in The Office(TM)
product are readily  available  and  adaptable to the latest  industry  computer
standards.

GOVERNMENTAL MATTERS

Except for the usual and customary business licenses and regulations, AlphaNet's
business is not subject to governmental regulations or approval of its products.

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

         In addition to other  information in this Form 10-K, the following risk
factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because
these factors  currently have or may in the future have a significant  impact on
our business,  operating  results or financial  condition.  Actual results could
differ  materially  from  those  projected  in  the  forward-looking  statements
contained in this Form 10-K as a result of the risk factors  discussed below and
elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

A significant portion of our annual revenue is derived from a single customer.

         During  the years  ended  December  31,  2005,  2004 and 2003,  one UPG
customer,  Brinks, accounted for 55%, 51% and 50% of total revenues. The loss of
this significant  customer would materially decrease the Company's total revenue
and  would  consequently  have a  material  adverse  impact  on our  results  of
operations and our financial condition.

We do not have long-term contracts with any of our suppliers.

         A  significant  portion  of  UPG's  inventory  purchases  are  from two
suppliers representing approximately 44% and 22% for the year ended December 31,
2005,  and  approximately  44% and  19% for the  similar  period  in  2004.  UPG
purchased  approximately 70% and 61% for year ending December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively  of  its  product  through  domestic  sources  with  the  remainder
purchased  from  international  sources,  predominantly  in the  Pacific Rim and
mainland  China.  While UPG believes it can replace its suppliers in the Pacific
Rim and mainland China, the loss of these suppliers may result in cost increases
that would  decrease UPG's gross profit  margins,  and therefore have an adverse
effect  on UPG's  results  of  operations.  The loss of the  domestic  supplier,
Ademco, would affect UPG business with Brinks since majority of Brinks inventory
is purchased from this supplier.

11
 
AlphaNet depends largely on its ability to keep pace with changing technologies.
If  we  are  unable  to  respond  quickly  and   cost-effectively   to  changing
communications  technologies  and devices  and  changes in  customer  tastes and
preferences, our business will be harmed.

         The  emerging  nature of  communications  technologies  requires  us to
continually update our AlphaNet products and service offerings,  particularly in
response to competitive  offerings and to make sure they are compatible with and
take  advantage  of  new   technologies  and  changes  in  consumer  tastes  and
preferences.  Our inability or the inability of our suppliers to respond quickly
and  cost-effectively  to changing  communications  technologies and devices and
changes in customer  tastes and  preferences,  could make our  existing  service
offerings less  competitive  and may cause us to lose market share. We cannot be
certain that we will successfully  develop,  acquire and market new products and
services that respond to competitive and technological developments and changing
customer needs.

Most of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do.

         We face strong competition from existing competitors,  many of whom are
substantially  larger than us. New competitors or competitors'  price reductions
or  increased  spending on  marketing  and product  development,  as well as any
increases in the price of raw materials  that our suppliers pass on would have a
negative  impact on our financial  condition and our  competitive  position,  as
larger  competitors  will be in a better  position to bear these costs and price
increases.

Our long-term growth strategy assumes that we make suitable acquisitions.  If we
are unable to address the risks associated with these  acquisitions our business
could be harmed.

         Our long-term  growth strategy  includes  identifying and, from time to
time,  acquiring  suitable  candidates on acceptable  terms.  In particular,  we
intend to acquire  businesses that provide  products and services that expand or
complement our existing  businesses and expand our geographic reach. In pursuing
acquisition  opportunities,  we may compete with other companies  having similar
growth and investment  strategies.  Competition  for these  acquisition  targets
could  also  result in  increased  acquisition  costs and a  diminished  pool of
businesses,  technologies,  services or products available for acquisition.  Our
long-term  growth  strategy  could be impeded if we fail to identify and acquire
promising candidates on terms acceptable to us. Assimilating acquired businesses
involves a number of other risks, including, but not limited to:

     o  disrupting our business;
     o  incurring  additional  expense  associated  with a write-off of all or a
        portion  of the  related  goodwill  and other  intangible  assets due to
        changes in market  conditions  or the economy in the markets in which we
        compete or because acquisitions are not providing the benefits expected;
     o  incurring  unanticipated costs or unknown  liabilities;
     o  managing   more   geographically-dispersed   operations;
     o  diverting management's resources from other business concerns;
     o  retaining the employees of the acquired businesses;
     o  maintaining existing customer relationships of acquired companies;
     o  assimilating  the operations  and personnel of the acquired  businesses;
        and
     o  maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies.

                                       12
 
For all these reasons,  our pursuit of an overall  acquisition or any individual
acquisition  could have a material  adverse  effect on our  business,  financial
condition and results of operations.  If we are unable to  successfully  address
any of these risks, our business could be harmed.

Rapid  growth  in  our  business  could  strain  our  managerial,   operational,
financial, accounting and information systems, customer service staff and office
resources.  If we fail to manage our growth  effectively,  our  business  may be
negatively impacted.

         In order to  achieve  our growth  strategy,  we will need to expand all
aspects  of  our   business,   including   our  computer   systems  and  related
infrastructure,  customer service  capabilities and sales and marketing efforts.
We cannot  assure you that our  infrastructure,  technical  staff and  technical
resources will adequately accommodate or facilitate our expanded operations.  To
be successful,  we will need to continually improve our financial and managerial
controls,  billing systems,  reporting systems and procedures,  and we will also
need to continue to expand, train and manage our workforce.  In addition,  as we
offer new  products and  services,  we will need to increase the size and expand
the training of our customer  service  staff to ensure that they can  adequately
respond to  customer  inquiries.  If we fail to  adequately  train our  customer
service  staff and provide  staffing  sufficient to support our new products and
services, we may lose customers.

If we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified management and technical
personnel, our business may be harmed.

         Our success  depends in large part on the  contributions  of our senior
management team, technology personnel and other key employees and on our ability
to  attract,  integrate,  train,  retain  and  motivate  these  individuals  and
additional highly skilled technical and sales and marketing  personnel.  We face
intense competition in hiring and retaining quality management  personnel.  Many
of these  companies have greater  financial  resources than we do to attract and
retain qualified  personnel.  The only key employees that have signed employment
agreements  are Randy  Hardin,  CEO of UPG,  and Ian  Edmonds,  COO of UPG.  Mr.
Hardin's  agreement  expired  on  March  1,  2006  and  he is now  serving  on a
month-to-month  basis.  Mr. Edmond's  agreement  expires July 1, 2006. If we are
unable to retain our key employees or attract, integrate, train and retain other
highly qualified  employees in the future,  when necessary,  our business may be
negatively impacted.

There is a lack of an active  public market for our common stock and the trading
price of our common stock is subject to volatility.

         There is a lack of an active public  market for our common  stock,  and
the trading price of our common stock is subject to volatility. The quotation of
shares of our common stock on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board began in April
1999.  There  can be no  assurances,  however,  that a market  will  develop  or
continue for our common stock. Our common stock may be thinly traded,  if traded
at all, even if we achieve full operation and generate  significant  revenue and
is likely to experience  significant price fluctuations.  In addition, our stock
may be defined as a "penny  stock" under Rule 3a51-1  adopted by the  Securities
and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended.  In general, a "penny stock" includes securities of companies which are
not listed on the  principal  stock  exchanges  or the National  Association  of

13
 
Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System, or Nasdaq, National Market System
and have a bid price in the market of less than $5.00;  and  companies  with net
tangible  assets of less than  $2,000,000  ($5,000,000 if the issuer has been in
continuous operation for less than three years), or which have recorded revenues
of less than  $6,000,000 in the last three years.  "Penny stocks" are subject to
Rule  15g-9,   which  imposes   additional   sales  practice   requirements   on
broker-dealers  that sell such  securities  to persons  other  than  established
customers and "accredited investors"  (generally,  individuals with net worth in
excess of $1,000,000 or annual incomes exceeding $200,000,  or $300,000 together
with their spouses,  or individuals  who are officers or directors of the issuer
of the securities). For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must
make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the
purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to sale. Consequently, this
Rule may  adversely  affect  the  ability of  broker-dealers  to sell our common
stock,  and therefore,  may adversely  affect the ability of our stockholders to
sell common stock in the public market. The trading price of our common stock is
likely to be subject to wide fluctuation. Factors affecting the trading price of
our common stock may include:

     o  variations in our financial results;
     o  announcements  of  innovations,  new solutions,  strategic  alliances or
        significant agreement by us or by our competitors;
     o  recruitment or departure of key personnel;
     o  changes  in  estimates  of  our  financial  results  or  changes  in the
        recommendations  of any  securities  analysts  that  elect to follow our
        common stock;
     o  market  conditions in our industry,  the industries of our customers and
        the economy as a whole; and
     o  sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that
        substantial  amounts of our common  stock will be sold,  by our existing
        stockholders in the public market.

ITEM 2.  DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTIES

Zunicom

Zunicom's executive offices are located in Carrollton,  Texas, and are leased by
UPG.

UPG

On  February  1, 2002,  UPG  entered  into a lease for a  warehouse  facility in
Carrollton,  Texas.  On March 14,  2003,  UPG entered  into an  amendment to the
lease.  The term of the new lease is from  February  1, 2004 and will  expire on
December 31, 2009.  Beginning  February 1, 2004,  the leased space  increased to
approximately 92,200 square feet. Beginning July 1, 2004, the premises increased
to  approximately  148,840 square feet.  The monthly rent will be  approximately
$23,000 per month from  February 1, 2004 to December 31, 2009.  UPG is using the
additional space to expand its distribution  facility and to house its corporate
offices.

On April 1, 2002, UPG entered into a three-year lease agreement which originally
expired  March 31,  2005 and was  renewed to March 31,  2006.  This lease is for
1,328 square feet of office space in Overland Park, Kansas at an average monthly

14
 
rent of approximately $1,700.  Starting April 1, 2006, the agreement will become
month-to-month, whereby either party may terminate with a 30-day notice.

On April 30, 2003,  UPG entered into a lease  agreement for  approximately  five
years with  approximately  5,000  square feet of retail and  warehouse  space in
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  UPG is leasing this space for approximately $1,600 per
month beginning August 1, 2003 through July 31, 2008.

AlphaNet

AlphaNet  occupies 4,900 square feet of leased office space in Toronto,  Canada.
As of December 31, 2005, the per month lease cost is approximately $13,300. This
lease expires April 30, 2007. AlphaNet also has a repair and service facility in
Colorado  Springs,  Colorado,  which is leased on annual basis. The monthly rent
from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2006 is $761.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Energizer  Holdings,  Inc.  and Eveready  Battery  Company,  Inc.  (collectively
"Eveready")  have initiated  legal  proceedings  against the Company and over 20
other respondents  relating to the manufacture,  importation and sale of certain
alkaline  batteries alleged to infringe U.S. Patent No.  5,464,709.  Eveready is
seeking a general  exclusion  order with respect to future  importation of these
batteries. The Company has denied infringement and has been vigorously defending
this action.  The International  Trade Commission ruled against Eveready and the
matter was  appealed  to the United  States  Court of  Appeals  for the  Federal
Circuit.  On January 25, 2006,  the Federal  Circuit  reversed the  Commission's
holding of  invalidity  and has  remanded for further  proceedings  based on its
construction  of  Eveready's  patent.  For more  information,  see In re Certain
Zero-Mercury-Added  Alkaline  Batteries,  Parts Thereof and Products  Containing
Same,  Investigation No. 337-TA-493,  in the United States  International  Trade
Commission.

In September of 2005, A.J.  Gilson, a former sales  representative  of Universal
filed an action in the District Court of Dallas County,  Texas against Universal
and  Zunicom  claiming  damages for breach of contract in the amount of $430,722
and all reasonable and necessary  attorney fees. In relation to this matter, the
Company is defending  itself and considers the claim without  merit.  Management
does not expect the final  resolution  of this claim to have a material  adverse
effect on our financial position. However, depending on the amount and timing of
an  unfavorable  resolution  of  claim  against  the  Company,  or the  costs of
settlement or  litigation,  the Company's  future  results of operations or cash
flows could be materially adversely affected.

BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

On March 23, 2006,  UPG entered into a Renewal and  Modification  Agreement with
Compass  Bank.  This allows UPG to borrow the full $12 Million  instead of being
limited to Borrower's  Eligible Accounts Receivable and Inventory limits but the
inventory  borrowings  cannot  exceed  the  85%  of  the  outstanding  value  of
Borrower's  Eligible  Accounts  Receivable  at any one  time.  The  Renewal  and
Modification  Agreement  provides UPG with  additional  borrowing  ability under
certain  circumstances.  The Renewal and  Modification  Agreement gives UPG more
borrowing availability and flexibility for borrowings.

On March 9, 2006,  AlphaNet notes payable to related parties  totaling  $217,128
were paid in full.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 2004

Currently,the operations of Zunicom, Inc.are conducted through its subsidiaries,
UPG and AlphaNet.

Revenues

Zunicom's  consolidated  revenues increased by $13,943,728 or 20% to $83,090,788
in 2005 compared to $69,147,060 for the similar period in 2004.

UPG had revenues of  $81,275,175  in 2005 compared to  $67,159,545 in 2004 or an
increase of $14,115,630 or 21%.

AlphaNet had revenues of  $1,815,613 in 2005 compared to $1,987,515 in 2004 or a
decrease of $171,902 or 9%.

UPG's increase in revenues of $14,155,630 is primarily attributable to increased
revenues  from  a  third  party  fulfillment  customer,  Brinks,  UPG's  largest
customer.  Revenues  from  sales to  Brinks  and  Brinks  dealers  increased  by
approximately  $11,741,000  in 2005.  In  addition,  sales of  battery,  battery
related and battery powered  products  increased by $2,374,621 over the previous
year  due  to  new  customers,   increased  volume  on  existing   accounts  and
diversification  into new product  lines  compared to the same period last year.
UPG  anticipates  continued  sales  increases  in the battery,  battery  powered
product line and new products.

AlphaNet's decrease in revenues of $176,748 or 9% is attributable to the decline
in revenue on the  InnfaxTM  product in the amount of  $243,000,  as a result of
non-renewals  in InnFaxTM  contracts.  The decrease is  partially  offset by the
increased usage and installations of "The Office" of approximately $83,000.

Cost of Revenues

Zunicom's  consolidated  cost of revenues  increased  by  $12,596,863  or 21% to
$71,441,620 in 2005 from $58,844,757 in 2004.

UPG's cost of revenues  totaled  $70,960,235  in 2005 compared to $58,355,712 in
2004. The cost of revenues, as a percentage of revenues for UPG was 87% for 2005
and 2004. UPG's cost of product is comprised of the base product cost,  freight,
duty and commissions where applicable.

20
 
AlphaNet's  cost of revenues  totaled  $481,385 in 2005  compared to $489,045 in
2004.  AlphaNet's  direct  servicing  costs as a percentage of service  revenues
increased  to 27%  compared to 25% for the same period in 2004.  The increase in
cost as a percentage of revenue is associated  to additional  costs  incurred in
installing The Office(TM).

Operating Expenses

Zunicom's consolidated operating expenses, consisting mainly of selling, general
and  administrative  expenses,  as well as,  depreciation  and  amortization  of
property  and  equipment,  decreased  by  $695,974 or 7% to  $9,280,832  in 2005
compared to $9,976,806 in 2004.

The selling,  general and  administrative  expenses of UPG, AlphaNet and Zunicom
totaled $7,270,497,  $1,156,478 and $542,586 respectively,  in 2005, compared to
$6,997,282, $1,240,843 and $502,255 in 2004.

The selling,  general and administrative expenses of UPG were $7,270,497 in 2005
compared to  $6,997,282 in 2004.  Expressed as a percentage  of UPG's  revenues,
selling,  general and administrative expenses were 9% in 2005 compared to 10% in
2004. UPG's increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $273,215
was  attributable to increase in bonus expense of $519,046 and wages of $127,227
associated with the Company's improved performance, insurance of $168,012, trade
shows,  travel and  entertainment  of $99,843  and  contract  labor of  $84,104.
Additionally,  UPG made donations of battery  products and cash of $43,964,  for
Hurricane Katrina charities and other organizations. These increases were offset
by reductions in rent,  utilities and property taxes of $204,395 due to the 2004
consolidation  of  facilities,  legal costs of $149,931,  bad debts of $125,557,
sales representative  commissions of $86,353, bank charges of $77,985, packaging
design costs of $69,905 and consulting fees of $68,854.

AlphaNet's selling,  general and administrative expenses decreased by $84,365 or
7% in 2005 compared to 2004. The decrease is primarily attributable to decreases
in wages of  $61,934,  dues and  subscriptions  of  $24,579,  property  taxes of
$16,284,  legal of $12,863, and travel expense of $12,220. These reductions were
offset by increases in equipment rental of $16,855, rent of $13,882,  accounting
costs of $14,396, and bank charges of $10,069.

Zunicom's increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $40,331 in
2005 was primarily attributable to increases in bonus of $70,995 associated with
the Company's improved performance and legal fees of $87,302 offset by decreases
in fees paid to an investor  relations  firm of $100,750 and office  supplies of
$16,359.

The  decrease in  Zunicom's  operating  expenses is  primarily  attributable  to
AlphaNet's   write-down  of  certain  assets  that  were  de-installed  in  2004
accounting  for $635,598.  Write downs during the similar period in 2005 totaled
$5,311 for the Company.

For the  year  ended  December  31,  2005,  the  Company  incurred  $305,959  in
depreciation  and  amortization  expense  compared to  $570,570  for the similar
period in 2004,  a decrease  of  $264,611.  The  decrease  in  depreciation  and
amortization  expense is primarily  related to the facsimile  equipment that was
written off by AlphaNet in 2004.

21
 
Interest Expense

Zunicom's  consolidated interest expense decreased to $619,374 in 2005, compared
to $632,749  in 2004,  a decrease  of $13,375 or 2%. The  decrease is  primarily
attributable  to lesser  interest paid on AlphaNet  notes payable in 2005 due to
the principal payments made during 2005.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 2003

Revenues

Zunicom's consolidated revenues increased by $8,024,757 or 13% to $69,147,060 in
2004 compared to $61,122,303 for the similar period in 2003.

UPG had revenues of  $67,159,545  in 2004 compared to  $58,669,741 in 2003 or an
increase of $8,489,804 or 14%.

AlphaNet had revenues of  $1,987,515 in 2004 compared to $2,452,562 in 2003 or a
decrease of $465,047 or 19%.

UPG's increase in revenues of $8,489,804 is primarily  attributable to increased
revenues  from  a  third  party  fulfillment  customer,  Brinks,  UPG's  largest
customer.  Revenues  increased  from the sales to Brinks and  Brinks  dealers by
approximately $8,200,000 in 2004. In addition, sales of battery, battery related
and battery powered products increased by approximately  $4,000,000 which offset
the decline in drop shipment sales of $3,400,000 in 2004.

AlphaNet continues to experience declines in facsimile usage by hotel guests and
declining installations of facsimile equipment at hotels. In addition,  AlphaNet
no longer charges hotels service and usage fees upon contract renewal.  However,
AlphaNet's  decrease in facsimile  revenues of  approximately  $613,000 has been
partially  offset by the increased usage and  installations of The Office(TM) of
approximately $154,000.

Of the $1,987,515 total AlphaNet revenues for 2004,  $477,588 was generated from
InnFaxTM products compared to $1,090,344 for the same period in 2003.  Facsimile
revenues also includes  monthly service fees on equipment  previously  installed
under service fee plans. For service fee plans,  AlphaNet  retains  ownership of
the  equipment,  and earns  recurring  revenue from customer  usage as well as a
monthly service fee. For the twelve months ending December 31, 2004, service fee
revenue represented 2% of total facsimile revenue compared to 28% in 2003.

Cost of Revenues

Zunicom's  consolidated  cost of  revenues  increased  by  $8,572,983  or 17% to
$58,844,757 in 2004 from $50,271,774 in 2003.

UPG's cost of revenues  totaled  $58,355,712  in 2004 compared to $49,564,588 in
2003. The cost of revenues, as a percentage of revenues for UPG was 87% and 84%,
respectively  for 2004 and 2003.  UPG's cost of product is comprised of the base
product  cost,  freight,  duty  and  commissions  where  applicable.   Aggregate
commissions on product purchases in 2004 were approximately $754,000 compared to
approximately $923,000 in 2003.

22
 
AlphaNet's  cost of revenues  totaled  $489,045 in 2004  compared to $707,186 in
2003.  The decrease in  AlphaNet's  cost of revenues in 2004 compared to 2003 is
primarily  due to the decrease in revenues.  Cost of revenues as a percentage of
revenues decreased to 25% in 2004 from 29% in 2003 due to a decrease in the cost
associated with The Office(TM) installation in hotels.

Operating Expenses

Zunicom's consolidated operating expenses, consisting mainly of selling, general
and  administrative  expenses,  as well as,  depreciation  and  amortization  of
property  and  equipment,  increased  by  $416,844 or 4% to  $9,976,806  in 2004
compared to $9,559,962 in 2003.

The selling,  general and  administrative  expenses of UPG, AlphaNet and Zunicom
totaled $6,997,282,  $1,240,843 and $502,255 respectively,  in 2004, compared to
$6,602,033, $1,288,305 and $388,885 in 2003.

The selling,  general and administrative expenses of UPG were $6,997,282 in 2004
compared to  $6,602,033 in 2003.  Expressed as a percentage  of UPG's  revenues,
selling, general and administrative expenses were 10% in 2004 compared to 11% in
2003. UPG's increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $395,249
was partially  attributable to increase in consulting and contract labor fees of
$179,521.  Additionally,  cost in catalogs and new package  design  increased by
$132,213,  commissions to sales representatives  increased by $127,000,  rent by
$115,623,  bank charges by $108,903,  warehouse and office  supplies by $83,044,
and  property  insurance  by $64,713.  These  increases  are  attributed  to the
continued  growth and  marketing  of UPG's  products and sales growth to Brinks.
These  increases  were  partially  offset by the decrease in  personnel  cost of
$348,500 and bad debt expense of $102,000, compared to the same period in 2003.

AlphaNet's selling,  general and administrative expenses decreased by $47,462 or
4% in 2004 compared to 2003. The decrease is primarily attributable to decreased
personnel  costs of $21,477 and property and general  insurance cost of $25,944.
These  decreased  expenses  are  attributable  to the  reduction in the business
operations of the company as revenue in InnFax(TM) decline during 2004.

The  increase  in  selling,  general and  administrative  expenses,  incurred by
Zunicom which were not allocated to its operating units, of $113,370 in 2004 was
primarily  attributable  to fees paid to an investor  relation  firm of $79,580,
accounting fees of $19,759 and office supplies and equipment cost of $7,487.

During the year ended December 31, 2004,  Zunicom wrote off $665,856 of property
and  equipment,  of which $639,447 was in facsimile  machines.  Ownership of the
facsimile  equipment  was  transferred  to the hotels  during  2004.  Impairment
related to the facsimile equipment charges incurred in 2003 totaled $559,448.

For the year ended December 31, 2004,  Zunicom incurred $570,570 in depreciation
and amortization  expense compared to $721,291 for the similar period in 2003, a
decrease of $150,721.  The decrease in depreciation and amortization  expense is
primarily  related  to the  facsimile  equipment  that has been  written  off by
AlphaNet.

23
 
Interest Expense

Zunicom's  consolidated interest expense increased to $632,750 in 2004, compared
to $612,230 in 2003, an increase of $20,520 or 3%. The increase is  attributable
to  increased  borrowings  on the UPG line of  credit  partially  offset  by the
decrease  in the  interest  paid on  AlphaNet  notes  payable in 2004 due to the
principal payments made during 2003.

Other Income (Expense)

Zunicom's consolidated other expense was $43,879 for the year ended December 31,
2004  compared  to other  income of  $130,884  for 2003.  The 2003 other  income
consists  primarily  of the sale of a patent by  AlphaNet  for net  proceeds  of
$141,251.

LIQUIDITY - YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005

Zunicom,  on a consolidated basis, had cash and cash equivalents of $731,626 and
$458,068 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Net cash provided by operating  activities  was $532,866  through  December 2005
compared to cash used in  operations  of  $3,266,055  for the similar  period in
2004. The cash provided by operating  activities in 2005 is primarily related to
net income of $1,739,875, increases in accounts payable of $5,534,530, provision
for bad debts and obsolete  inventory  of $180,852  and  $63,910,  respectively,
depreciation  of property  and  equipment of  $305,959,  write-off  property and
equipment  of $5,311,  and a decrease in accounts  receivable-other  of $133,966
offset by increases in inventories of $5,917,346,  accounts  receivable-trade of
$1,204,587,  prepaid and other  current  assets of  $185,336,  and  decreases in
accrued liabilities of $120,796 and deferred rent of $8,694.

Zunicom used cash in investing  activities of $357,988 to purchase  property and
equipment during 2005.

Net cash provided in financing activities during 2005 primarily consisted of net
cash  provided  under the UPG line of credit of  $734,532,  offset by payment of
related party notes payable of $643,000.

The net increase in cash in 2005 was $273,558.

UPG's  current line of credit  agreement  with Compass Bank provides for maximum
borrowings of $12,000,000 with interest payable monthly at LIBOR Index rate plus
2.5% (6.79% at December 31, 2005) and matures May 5, 2007. On July 25, 2005, UPG
entered into an agreement with Compass Bank fixing the interest rate at 6.99% on
the first $6,000,000 of borrowings and LIBOR Index Rate plus 2.5% on the balance
of the outstanding  borrowing under UPG's line of credit.  The line of credit is
due on demand and is secured by accounts receivable,  inventories, and equipment
of UPG. On March 23, 2006, UPG entered into Renewal and  Modification  Agreement
which  modified the line's  availability  base borrowing  formula,  85% of UPG's
outstanding value of Borrower's Eligible Accounts Receivable and 50% of eligible
inventory provided,  however that the foregoing sub-limit upon availability with
respect to Borrower's Eligible Inventory shall not exceed 85% of the outstanding
value of Borrower's  Eligible  Accounts  Receivable at any one time outstanding.
The Renewal and Modification Agreement gives UPG more borrowing availability and
flexibility for borrowings.  In addition,  UPG must maintain  certain  financial

24
 
covenants  including  ratios on fixed charge  coverage and minimum  tangible net
worth,  as well as, maximum debt to tangible net worth and an interest  coverage
ratio. UPG's maximum annual capital expenditures allowable pursuant to the terms
of the line of credit total $100,000.  Through  December 31, 2005, UPG's capital
expenditures  of $185,647 exceed the allowable  amount,  and therefore UPG is in
violation  of this  covenant.  UPG has obtained a waiver as of December 31, 2005
for this violation. The Company was in compliance with all other covenants as of
and for the year ended  December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2005,  $9,261,435 was
outstanding  under the line of credit  and  $2,231,019  remained  available  for
borrowings under the line of credit based on the borrowing formula.

At December 31, 2005,  AlphaNet had notes  payable to financing  companies  with
balances  totaling  $217,128.  One  note in the  original  principal  amount  of
$1,525,000  is payable to Appel  Investments,  Inc., a company in which Kim Yeow
Tan,  William Tan's  brother,  is an officer,  director and  shareholder.  As of
December 31, 2005,  AlphaNet owes $138,792 in principal on this note.  The other
note in the original  principal  amount of  $1,000,000 is payable to AHS Funding
LLC, a company in which Jenny  Jechart,  a  shareholder  of the Company,  is the
principal  shareholder  and  director.  As of December 31, 2005,  AlphaNet  owes
$78,336 in principal on this note.  These notes,  which bear  interest at 20.5%,
originally matured on October 21, 2002 and were paid in full on March 9, 2006.

Zunicom  believes that cash provided by its operations and cash available  under
the UPG line of credit will be sufficient to meet its operational needs over the
next year.

LIQUIDITY - YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004

Zunicom,  on a consolidated basis, had cash and cash equivalents of $458,068 and
$659,350 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Net cash used in operating  activities  through  December 2004 of $3,266,055 was
primarily  related to net loss of $348,040,  decreases in trade accounts payable
and accrued  liabilities  of $826,057,  increases in inventory of $2,768,059 and
accounts  receivable  of  $1,168,945;  offset by  depreciation  of property  and
equipment of $570,570 and  provisions for bad debt of $346,951 and the write-off
of certain facsimile equipment and other assets totaling $665,856.

Zunicom used cash in investing  activities of $203,064 to purchase  property and
equipment during 2004.

Net cash  provided in  financing  activities  during 2004  consisted of net cash
provided  under the UPG line of credit of  $3,274,593,  for  payment  of current
liabilities and for purchases of inventory.

The net decrease in cash in 2004 was $201,282.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

At  December  31, 2005 the Company  did not have any  material  commitments  for
capital  expenditures  and does not expect any material  changes in the need for
capital   expenditures.   The  Company  has  no  off  balance  sheet   financing
arrangements.

UPG  currently  uses the  services of an import  consultant  to  coordinate  the
purchases  of goods  and  services  from the  Pacific  Rim for  which UPG pays a
percentage of the cost of the product in servicing  fees.  Approximately  30% of
UPG's product  purchases are covered by this  agreement.  Under the terms of the
agreement  UPG  is  obligated  to pay  commission  on all  purchases  made  from
factories  introduced to UPG by the  consultant.  This agreement  which has been
amended  orally to include  additional  factories  and  varying  percentages  of
commission, may be terminated at any time. However,  commissions will be payable
to the  consultant  for as long as UPG  purchase's  product from the  introduced
factories.  The import  consultant  is  independent  from the  management of the
Company and is not associated with any employee,  officer or Board member of the
Company other than through the services provided for the Company. In view of the
increase in the volume of business and the competitive  market  conditions,  the
Board of UPG is continually  reviewing this  arrangement.  Additionally,  UPG is
exploring  the  possibilities  of  opening  an  office  in China  to  facilitate
purchases of products for UPG. However,  no facilities have been secured at this
time.

INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY FLUCTUATION

The goods that UPG  purchases  from Asia are subject to  international  currency
fluctuations.  The  management of UPG does not believe that the  fluctuation  in
currency presents a serious threat to its operations.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The  consolidated  financial  statements  have been prepared in accordance  with
accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in the  U.S.A.,  which  require the
Company to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and
revenues and expenses during the periods  reported.  Actual results could differ
from those  estimates.  The Company  believes  the  following  are the  critical
accounting  policies  which  could  have  the  most  significant  effect  on the
Company's reported results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex
judgments by management.

                                       26
 
Revenue Recognition

The Company has two segments:  the battery and  fulfillment  sales segment which
represents the  operations of UPG and the facsimile and business  center segment
which represents the operations of AlphaNet.  UPG is essentially an importer and
distributor  of  batteries  and  battery  related  products.  AlphaNet  provides
computer related access services to hotels.

UPG recognizes revenue in accordance with SAB 104 when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists,  delivery has occurred,  the price is fixed and determinable
and collectiblity is reasonably assured.  Revenue recognition for specific types
of revenue are described below.

UPG is a distributor  who  purchases  both finished  goods and  components  from
domestic and  international  suppliers.  UPG's  customers  order finished goods,
either  bulk  battery  product  or  single   shippable   units,  to  fill  their
requirements.

UPG adds  value  to  products  and  components  by  packaging  them in  customer
specified  "kits" or tailor made units that are  convenient  for the customer to
order and ship.  Additionally,  UPG has several  customers that require specific
battery  solutions  for  inclusion  in their own  products.  UPG will obtain the
battery and  necessary  components  and configure a new finished good unit based
upon  customer  specifications.  UPG refers to this  process  as a "value  added
service".  Generally,  UPG  recognizes  sales of finished  goods at the time the
customer takes title to the product.

UPG sells  products to several  customers  in bulk  quantities.  UPG obtains the
order from the customer  and  arranges for the delivery of the product  directly
from UPG's vendor to the customer to reduce  freight  costs and wear and tear on
the product from excessive  handling.  UPG refers to these transactions as "drop
shipments"  because the product is shipped  directly  from UPG's vendor to UPG's
customer. Generally, UPG recognizes revenue at the time the customer takes title
to the  product.  We  have  evaluated  the  criteria  outlined  in  EITF  99-19,
"Reporting  Revenue Gross as Principal  versus Net as an Agent," in  determining
whether it is appropriate under U.S. GAAP to record the gross amount of revenues
and related costs or the net amount earned after  deducting the related costs of
goods sold. We record the gross amounts  billed to our customers  because we are
the  primary  obligor  in these  transactions,  bear the  inventory  risk,  have
latitude in establishing  prices,  bear credit risk and have the right to select
suppliers.

AlphaNet  provides  computer related access services to hotels.  AlphaNet places
computer  components in the hotel  properties which allow hotel guests access to
facsimile machines,  computers and other office machinery.  The hotel guests use
the equipment on a fee per minute basis which  AlphaNet  tracks.  AlphaNet bills
either the hotel  property or the  customer  directly at the end of each fee per
minute  session.  Much of this  business  is  conducted  through  credit  cards.
Generally, AlphaNet records the sale upon completion of the session.

Post Shipment Obligations

UPG offers its customers a limited  warranty for  replacement  of finished goods
that do not  function  properly  for  approximately  one year.  Certain  battery
chemistries  require a slightly shorter warranty period while other  chemistries

27
 
have an extended  warranty period.  The vast majority of UPG's product offerings
have a one year limited warranty.  The most common types of warranty  complaints
are  batteries  that leak or batteries  that do not provide the voltage they are
intended to supply.  UPG's written warranty is limited to the replacement of the
product  purchased  and does not cover the product the battery is used in. UPG's
replacement  rate is  insignificant,  less  than  0.25% of total  sales,  and is
therefore  recorded  as a  reduction  of sales  when  the  warranty  expense  is
incurred.  If UPG  determines  that a shipment  of product  has a  manufacturing
defect,  UPG has recourse with the manufacturer to recover the replacement costs
incurred but the cost of isolated or  individual  instances of defects are borne
by UPG.

UPG has no other  post-shipment  obligations.  UPG does  not  offer  any type of
post-sale servicing.

AlphaNet  does  not  sell  products,  and as  such,  warranty  or post  shipment
obligations are not applicable.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Foreign Currency Exchange

Our customers are primarily located in the U.S.  However,  many of our suppliers
are located  outside the U.S.  and our  financial  results  could be impacted by
foreign  currency  exchange rates and market  conditions  abroad.  However,  the
aggregate impact of any likely exchange rate fluctuations would be immaterial as
most payments are made in U.S. dollars. We have not used derivative  instruments
to hedge our foreign exchange risks though we may choose to do so in the future.

Our  international  business  is  subject to risks  typical of an  international
business, including, but not limited to: differing economic conditions,  changes
in  political   climate,   differing  tax  structures,   other  regulations  and
restrictions  and foreign  exchange  rate  volatility.  Accordingly,  our future
results  could be  materially  adversely  affected  by changes in these or other
factors.  The effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on us during 2005 was
not material.

Interest Rates

Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily
to UPG's line of credit.  The line of credit,  maturing May 2007, bears interest
at LIBOR  plus 2.5%.  A  significant  change in the LIBOR  would have a material
effect on interest expense. On July 25, 2005, UPG entered into an agreement with
Compass  Bank  fixing  the  interest  rate at 6.99% on the first  $6,000,000  of
borrowings  and LIBOR  Index Rate plus 2.5% on the  balance  of the  outstanding
borrowing  under UPG's line of credit.  The Company's  existing notes payable to
related parties have fixed interest rates;  however,  future borrowings may bear
interest at variable rates and,  accordingly,  the Company's  exposure to market
risk for changes in interest  rates may change in the  future.  At December  31,
2005,  the Company's debt owed to related  parties was $217,128.  This debt bore
interest at a fixed rate of 20.5% and was paid in full on March 9, 2006.

Stockholders and Board of Directors
Zunicom, Inc. and Subsidiaries

We have audited the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Zunicom,  Inc.
and  Subsidiaries  (the  "Company")  as of  December  31,  2005 and 2004 and the
related consolidated  statements of operations,  changes in stockholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
2005. Our audits also included the financial  statement schedule appearing under
Item  15(a)(2).  These  consolidated  financial  statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these  consolidated  financial  statements  and schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and  perform  the  audits to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the
financial  statements  are free of  material  misstatement.  The  Company is not
required  to have nor were we  engaged  to  perform,  audits  of their  internal
control over financial reporting.  Our audits included consideration of internal
control over financial  reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the  circumstances,  but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the  effectiveness  of the Company's  internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining,
on a  test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in the
financial  statements,  assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates  made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly,  in all  material  respects,  the  consolidated  financial  position  of
Zunicom,  Inc.  and  Subsidiaries  as of  December  31,  2005 and 2004,  and the
consolidated  results of their  operations  and their cash flows for each of the
years in the  three-year  period  ended  December  31, 2005 in  conformity  with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also,
in our opinion,  the related financial  statement  schedule,  when considered in
relation to the consolidated  financial  statements  taken as a whole,  presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A - ORGANIZATION

Zunicom, Inc. ("Zunicom") operates through its subsidiaries: (i) Universal Power
Group, Inc. ("UPG") and (ii) AlphaNet Hospitality Systems Inc. ("AlphaNet").

Zunicom,  Inc.,  formerly  Tech  Electro  Industries,  Inc.,  ("Zunicom"  or the
"Company"  or "we")  was  incorporated  under  the laws of the State of Texas on
January 10,  1992,  for the purpose of  acquiring  100% of the capital  stock of
Computer   Components   Corporation,   a  distributor  of  electric   components
incorporated  in 1968. On October 29, 1996, we  incorporated  Universal  Battery
Corporation  for the purpose of  expanding  into new markets for  batteries  and
battery-related  products.  In May 1999, we merged Universal Battery Corporation
into Computer Components  Corporation.  On January 17, 2003, Computer Components
Corporation changed its name to Universal Battery  Corporation.  Subsequently on
May 12, 2003,  Universal Battery Corporation changed its name to Universal Power
Group to reflect its business growth,  expansion and diversification.  Zunicom's
business operations through UPG encompass the sale of portable power and related
synergistic products, third party fulfillment,  and custom battery pack assembly
and kitting services to a wide range of industries.

On October 26, 1999,  Zunicom  completed the  acquisition  of AlphaNet.  Zunicom
acquired AlphaNet to gain an entry into the information  technology and Internet
related business sector.  AlphaNet is a leading provider of guest  communication
services to the hospitality market.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

The  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  include the  accounts of
Zunicom,  UPG and  AlphaNet.  All  significant  inter-company  transactions  and
balances  have been  eliminated  in  consolidation.  The  consolidated  group is
referred to as the "Company".

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all unrestricted  highly-liquid  investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.

Accounts Receivable

Trade  accounts  receivable  are  stated at the amount  the  Company  expects to
collect.  The Company  maintains  allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated
losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required  payments.
Management  considers the following factors when determining the  collectibility
of specific  customer  accounts:  customer  credit-worthiness,  past transaction
history with the customer,  current  economic  industry  trends,  and changes in
customer  payment terms. If the financial  condition of the Company's  customers
were to  deteriorate,  adversely  affecting  their  ability  to  make  payments,
additional allowances would be required. Based on management's  assessment,  the
Company  provides  for  estimated  uncollectible  amounts  through  a charge  to
earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance. Balances that remain outstanding

F-11

after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through
a reduction in the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable.

Inventories

Inventories consist of finished goods, primarily batteries and security products
related to UPG's third party  fulfillment  and materials used in the assembly of
batteries  into  "packs".  All items are stated at the lower of average  cost or
market.

UPG is a  significant  supplier  for  Brinks.  Brinks  requires  UPG to maintain
certain  inventory  levels  at  all  times.  Inventory  held  related  to  UPG's
relationship with Brinks,  primarily  security products,  totaled  approximately
$8,500,000  at December  31,  2005.  Brinks will  purchase  from UPG any and all
remaining  inventory held by UPG pursuant to an agreement with Brinks (including
inventory  in  transit)  and  pay  any  applicable   cancellation  fees  to  the
manufacturer upon termination of the relationship.

The Company  performs  periodic  evaluations,  based upon  business  trends,  to
specifically  identify  obsolete,   slow  moving,  and  non-salable   inventory.
Inventory  allowances are evaluated  periodically to ensure they reflect current
business trends.

Property and Equipment

Property  and  equipment  are  carried at cost.  Depreciation  of  equipment  is
provided  using the straight line method over the estimated  useful lives of the
assets  ranging  from three to ten years.  Assets held under  capital  lease and
leasehold  improvements are amortized on a straight-line  basis over the shorter
of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the related asset.

          ------------------------------- ------------------------
          PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT                Useful Lives
          ------------------------------- ------------------------
              Business center equipment           3 years
          ------------------------------- ------------------------
              Machinery and equipment           5 - 10 years
          ------------------------------- ------------------------
              Computer equipment                3 - 5 years
          ------------------------------- ------------------------
              Furniture and fixtures              10 years
          ------------------------------- ------------------------
              Leasehold improvements            4 - 5 years
          ------------------------------- ------------------------
              Vehicles                            7 years
          ------------------------------- ------------------------

Expenditures  for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of
property and equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs
are charged to expense as incurred.

Income Taxes

The  Company  utilizes  the asset  and  liability  approach  in  accounting  and
reporting  for income  taxes.  Deferred  income tax assets and  liabilities  are

                                      F-12

computed annually for differences  between the financial and tax basis of assets
and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible  amounts in the future
based on  enacted  tax laws and rates  applicable  to the  periods  in which the
differences  are expected to affect  taxable  income.  Valuation  allowances are
established  when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected
to be realized.  Income tax expense or benefit is the tax payable or  refundable
for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets
and liabilities.

Long-Lived Assets

The Company accounts for the impairment and disposition of long-lived  assets in
accordance with Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") No. 144,
"Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets". In accordance
with SFAS No.  144,  long-lived  assets are  reviewed  when events or changes in
circumstances  indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.  These
evaluations  include comparing the future undiscounted cash flows of such assets
to their carrying value.  If the carrying value exceeds the future  undiscounted
cash flows,  the assets are  written  down to their  estimated  fair value using
discounted cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the
Company wrote off certain fixed assets,  primarily  facsimile  equipment,  which
were taken out of service and are no longer in use, and accordingly,  recognized
impairment  charges totaling $5,311,  $665,856 and $559,448,  respectively.  The
charges are presented as write off of property and equipment in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations.

Deferred Rent

UPG's operating lease for its primary office and warehouse space contains a free
rent period and contains  predetermined  fixed  increases of the minimum  rental
rate  during the initial  lease term.  For this  lease,  UPG  recognizes  rental
expense on a  straight-line  basis over the  minimum  lease term and records the
difference  between the amounts charged to expense and the rent paid as deferred
rent.  In addition,  the landlord  provided  certain  allowances  for  leasehold
improvements  on this office and  warehouse  space  which have been  recorded as
deferred rent and leasehold improvements. The deferred rent will be amortized as
an offset to rent expense over the remaining term of the related lease.

Revenue Recognition

The Company has two segments:  the battery and  fulfillment  sales segment which
represents the  operations of UPG and the facsimile and business  center segment
which represents the operations of AlphaNet.  UPG is essentially an importer and
distributor  of  batteries  and  battery  related  products.  AlphaNet  provides
computer related access services to hotels.

UPG recognizes revenue in accordance with SAB 104 when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists,  delivery has occurred,  the price is fixed and determinable
and collectiblity is reasonably assured.  Revenue recognition for specific types
of revenue are described below.

UPG is a distributor  who  purchases  both finished  goods and  components  from
domestic and  international  suppliers.  UPG's  customers  order finished goods,
either  bulk  battery  product  or  single   shippable   units,  to  fill  their
requirements.

                                      F-13

UPG adds  value  to  products  and  components  by  packaging  them in  customer
specified  "kits" or tailor made units that are  convenient  for the customer to
order and ship.  Additionally,  UPG has several  customers that require specific
battery  solutions  for  inclusion  in their own  products.  UPG will obtain the
battery and  necessary  components  and configure a new finished good unit based
upon  customer  specifications.  UPG refers to this  process  as a "value  added
service".  Generally,  UPG  recognizes  sales of finished  goods at the time the
customer takes title to the product.

UPG sells  products to several  customers  in bulk  quantities.  UPG obtains the
order from the customer  and  arranges for the delivery of the product  directly
from UPG's vendor to the customer to reduce  freight  costs and wear and tear on
the product from excessive  handling.  UPG refers to these transactions as "drop
shipments"  because the product is shipped  directly  from UPG's vendor to UPG's
customer. Generally, UPG recognizes revenue at the time the customer takes title
to the  product.  UPG  has  evaluated  the  criteria  outlined  in  EITF  99-19,
"Reporting  Revenue Gross as Principal  versus Net as an Agent," in  determining
whether it is appropriate under U.S. GAAP to record the gross amount of revenues
and related costs or the net amount earned after  deducting the related costs of
goods sold. UPG records the gross amounts billed to customers  because it is the
primary obligor in these transactions, bears the inventory risk, has latitude in
establishing prices, bears credit risk and has the right to select suppliers.

AlphaNet  provides  computer related access services to hotels.  AlphaNet places
computer  components in the hotel  properties which allow hotel guests access to
facsimile machines,  computers and other office machinery.  The hotel guests use
the equipment on a fee per minute basis which  AlphaNet  tracks.  AlphaNet bills
either the hotel  property or the  customer  directly at the end of each fee per
minute  session.  Much of this  business  is  conducted  through  credit  cards.
Generally, AlphaNet records the sale upon completion of the session.

Post Shipment Obligations

UPG offers its customers a limited  warranty for  replacement  of finished goods
that do not  function  properly  for  approximately  one year.  Certain  battery
chemistries  require a slightly shorter warranty period while other  chemistries
have an extended  warranty period.  The vast majority of UPG's product offerings
have a one year limited warranty.  The most common types of warranty  complaints
are  batteries  that leak or batteries  that do not provide the voltage they are
intended to supply.  UPG's written warranty is limited to the replacement of the
product  purchased  and does not cover the product the battery is used in. UPG's
replacement  rate is  insignificant,  less  than  0.25% of total  sales,  and is
therefore  recorded  as a  reduction  of sales  when  the  warranty  expense  is
incurred.  If UPG  determines  that a shipment  of product  has a  manufacturing
defect,  UPG has recourse with the manufacturer to recover the replacement costs
incurred but the cost of isolated or  individual  instances of defects are borne
by UPG.

UPG has no other  post-shipment  obligations.  UPG does  not  offer  any type of
post-sale servicing.

AlphaNet  does  not  sell  products,  and as  such,  warranty  or post  shipment
obligations are not applicable.

F-14

At December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 UPG has a warranty reserve of approximately
$10,000.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are charged to costs of revenues in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company  accounts for  stock-based  employee  compensation  arrangements  in
accordance  with provisions of Accounting  Principles  Board ("APB") Opinion No.
25,  "Accounting  for Stock  Issued to  Employees."  Under APB  Opinion  No. 25,
compensation  expense for employees is based on the excess,  if any, on the date
of grant, between the fair value of the Company's stock over the exercise price.
Under APB Opinion No. 25, if the exercise  price of an  employee's  stock option
equals or exceeds the fair market  value of the  Company's  stock on the date of
grant,  no  compensation  expense  is  recognized.  The  Company  did not record
compensation  expense  related to the issuance of stock options during the years
ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Had the Company determined  compensation
based on the fair value at the grant date for its stock  options  under SFAS No.
123,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation,"  as amended by SFAS No. 148,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure and amendment
of FASB  Statement No. 123," net income (loss) and income (loss) per share would
have been increased (decreased) as indicated below:

Stock-based employee compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis
as options vest.

The  Company  accounts  for  equity   instruments  issued  to  non-employees  in
accordance  with the  provisions  of SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148 and
Emerging  Issues Task Force  ("EITF")  Issue No. 96-18,  "Accounting  for Equity
Instruments  That Are  Issued  to Other  Than  Employees  for  Acquiring,  or in
Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services." All transactions in which goods or
services are the consideration  received for the issuance of equity  instruments
are accounted for based on the fair value of the  consideration  received or the
fair  value  of  the  equity  instrument  issued,  whichever  is  more  reliably
measurable.  The  measurement  date of the fair value of the  equity  instrument
issued is the  earlier of the date on which the  counterparty's  performance  is
complete or the date on which it is probable that performance will occur.

In December 2004, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123
(revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123R"), which replaces SFAS No.
123 and  supersedes  APB Opinion No. 25. SFAS No 123R  requires all  share-based
payments  to  employees,  including  grants of  employee  stock  options,  to be
recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. The pro forma
disclosures  previously  permitted  under  SFAS  No.  123 will no  longer  be an
alternative to financial statement  recognition.  For the Company, SFAS No. 123R
is effective January 1, 2006.

The  Company  plans to adopt the new  standard  using the  modified  prospective
method. Under the modified prospective method,  companies are required to record
compensation expense for new and modified awards over the related vesting period
of such awards prospectively and record compensation  expense  prospectively for
the  unvested  portion,  at the  date of  adoption,  of  previously  issued  and
outstanding  awards  over  the  remaining  vesting  period  of such  awards.  No
amendments  to  prior  periods   presented  are  permitted  under  the  modified
prospective method. The future impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R cannot be
predicted as this time because it will depend on levels of share-based  payments
granted by the Company in the future.  However, had the Company adopted SFAS No.
123R in prior periods,  the impact of that standard would have  approximated the
impact of SFAS No. 123 as  described in the  disclosure  of pro forma net income
(loss) above.

Income (Loss) per Share

Basic net income  (loss) per share is computed by  dividing  net income  (loss),
decreased or increased by the preferred stock dividends of $37,219, $41,527, and
$41,515 for the years ending December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively,  by
the weighted average number of common shares  outstanding for the year.  Diluted
net  income(loss)  per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) decreased
or increased by the preferred stock dividends by the weighted  average number of
common  shares  and  common  stock  equivalents  outstanding  for the year.  The
Company's common stock equivalents,  including 19,500 options for the year ended
December 31, 2005,  3,529,581  warrants and 1,097,000 options for the year ended
December 31, 2004,  and 3,279,581  warrants and  1,227,000  options for the year
ended  December  31,  2003,  are not  included  in the  diluted  loss per  share
computations as they are anti-dilutive. In addition, the as-if conversion of the
preferred  stock  outstanding  at December  31,  2005 and 2004 into  177,976 and
209,176,  respectively,  shares of common  stock  have  been  excluded  from the

F-16

computations of diluted loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2005 and
2004 as the effect is anti-dilutive.

The following table provides reconciliation between basic and diluted net income
(loss) per share attributable to common stockholders:

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS No. 154,  "Accounting  Changes and Error Corrections,  a replacement of APB
opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3," was issued in June 2005.  SFAS No. 154
required retrospective  application to financial statements of prior periods for
changes  in  accounting  principle  that  are  not  adopted  prospectively.  The
statement also applies to changes required by an accounting  pronouncement  that
does not include specific  transaction  provisions.  This statement is effective
January 1, 2006.

Use of Estimates and Assumptions

Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing  financial  statements in
accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles.  Those estimates and
assumptions  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities,   the
disclosure of contingent  assets and  liabilities,  and the reported  amounts of
revenues and expenses.  Actual  results could vary from the estimates  that were
used.

NOTE D - LINES OF CREDIT

UPG's  current line of credit  agreement  with Compass Bank provides for maximum
borrowings of $12,000,000 with interest payable monthly at LIBOR Index rate plus
2.5% (6.79% at December 31, 2005) and matures May 5, 2007. On July 25, 2005, UPG
entered into an agreement with Compass Bank fixing the interest rate at 6.99% on
the first $6,000,000 of borrowings and LIBOR Index Rate plus 2.5% on the balance
of the outstanding  borrowing under UPG's line of credit.  The line of credit is
due on demand and is secured by accounts receivable,  inventories, and equipment
of UPG. On March 23, 2006, UPG entered into renewal and  modification  agreement
which modified the line's  availability  base borrowing  formula,  as more fully
described in Note P. In addition,  UPG must maintain certain financial covenants
including  ratios on fixed charge  coverage and minimum  tangible net worth,  as
well as,  maximum  debt to tangible  net worth and an interest  coverage  ratio.
UPG's maximum annual capital expenditures allowable pursuant to the terms of the
line of  credit  total  $100,000.  Through  December  31,  2005,  UPG's  capital
expenditures of $185,647 exceeds the allowable  amount,  and therefore UPG is in
violation  of this  covenant.  UPG has obtained a waiver as of December 31, 2005
for this  violation.  At December 31, 2005 and 2004,  $9,261,435 and $8,256,903,
respectively,  was  outstanding  under the line of  credit  and  $2,231,019  and
$3,473,097,  respectively,  remained  available for borrowings under the line of
credit based on the borrowing  formula.  During,  2004, UPG had a line of credit
with a financing  company that provided for maximum  borrowings  of  $12,000,000
with an interest  rate at the  lender's  prime plus  1.25%.  This line was fully
repaid during 2004.

NOTE F - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company leased its office and certain  warehouse  space,  from a partnership
consisting  of  members  of  the  family  of a  shareholder.  Rent  paid  to the
partnership was $16,800,  $100,800 and $100,800 for the years ended December 31,
2005,  2004 and 2003,  respectively.  This lease  required  monthly  payments of
$8,400 through its expiration in February 2005.

During 1999, the Company borrowed  $1,525,000 from a finance company that has an
officer who is a relative of Zunicom's  president.  The loan  requires  interest
payments monthly at 20.5% per annum. The principal was originally due on October
21, 2001 and was extended to March 27, 2006. At December 31, 2005, AlphaNet owed
$138,792 in  principal on this note which was paid in full on March 9, 2006 (See
Note P - Subsequent Events). The Company paid a loan origination fee of $150,737
related to the $1,525,000 note payable. As additional consideration, the finance
company  originally  received  warrants  to purchase  116,703  shares of Zunicom
common stock exercisable at $0.75 per share. The warrants vested immediately and
had an original  expiration date of October 20, 2004, but were further  extended
to expire on October 20, 2005.  These  warrants have since expired  unexercised.
The fair value of the  warrants on the grant date of $91,255  was  recorded as a
discount to the original  debt and was  amortized  over the original term of the
debt. There was no value recorded for the modification of the expiration date of
these warrants  during 2004 as management  determined that the fair value of the
modified warrants was immaterial.

F-19

During 1999, the Company  borrowed  $1,000,000 from a finance company that has a
principal  who is also a  shareholder  of  Zunicom.  The  loan  carries  monthly
interest  payments  at 20.5% per annum.  The  principal  was  originally  due on
October 21, 2001.  At December 31, 2005,  AlphaNet  owed $78,336 in principal on
this note  which  was paid in full on March 9,  2006  (See  Note P -  Subsequent
Events).  The  Company  paid a loan  origination  fee of $98,828  related to the
$1,000,000  note  payable.  As  additional  consideration,  the finance  company
originally  received  warrants to purchase 76,514 shares of Zunicom common stock
exercisable  at $0.75 per share.  The  warrants  vested  immediately  and had an
original  expiration  date of October 20, 2004, but were extended during 2004 to
October 20, 2005. These warrants have since expired unexercised.  The fair value
of the  warrants on the grant date of $59,839 was  recorded as a discount to the
original debt and was amortized over the original term of the debt. There was no
value recorded for the  modification  of the  expiration  date of these warrants
during  2004 as  management  determined  that  the fair  value  of the  modified
warrants was immaterial.

Also  during  1999,  the Company  engaged an  investment  company,  in which the
Company's  president  is a director and  shareholder  to act as sales agent in a
private placement  transaction.  The investment company received a placement fee
of 500,000 warrants as consideration for these services  rendered.  In addition,
the Company  retained the investment  company to refinance  certain  outstanding
indebtedness.  The investment company received an additional 550,000 warrants in
consideration  for  these  services   rendered.   The  1,050,000   warrants  are
exercisable  at $0.75 per share and had an original  expiration  date of October
20, 2004,  but were  extended to October 20, 2005.  There was no value  recorded
related to the modification of the expiration date of these warrants during 2004
as there was no consideration received from the investment company in return for
the extension. These warrants have since expired unexercised.

During  2000,  as  additional  consideration  for a $500,000  loan,  the Company
granted  Caspic  International,  Inc.  ("Caspic")  warrants to purchase  250,000
shares of common stock at $0.73 per share, exercisable immediately. William Tan,
the President,  CEO and a significant  shareholder of Zunicom is also a director
and  shareholder  of Caspic.  The  warrants had an original  expiration  date of
February 24, 2005, which was extended during 2004 to February 24, 2006. The fair
value of the  warrants on the grant date of $163,554  was recorded as a discount
to the original debt and was amortized over the original term of the debt. There
was no value recorded  related to the  modification  of the  expiration  date of
these warrants during 2004 as there was no consideration received from Caspic in
return for the extension. (See Note P - Subsequent Events).

NOTE G - PREFERRED STOCK

The  outstanding  Class A preferred stock bears  cumulative  dividends of 36 3/4
cents per share payable  annually and has a liquidation  preference of $5.25 per
share.  Through  December 31, 2005 the Company has paid all dividends which have
accrued on the preferred  stock.  The voting rights are equal to common  shares,

$13,000,000  and  begins to  expire in 2011.  The  current  and net  non-current
deferred tax assets have a 100%  valuation  allowance due to the  uncertainty of
generating future taxable income.

The Company's income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003 differed from the statutory federal rate of 34 percent as follows:

NOTE I - CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS

Financial  instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit  risk  consist  primarily  of cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  accounts
receivables.

Cash and cash  equivalent  deposits  are at risk to the extent  that they exceed
Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation  insured amounts.  To minimize this risk,
the  Company  places  its cash and cash  equivalents  with high  credit  quality
financial institutions.

In the normal  course of  business,  the  Company  extends  unsecured  credit to
virtually  all of its  customers.  Management  has  provided  an  allowance  for
doubtful  accounts  which  reflects  its  estimate  of amounts  which may become
uncollectible.  In the  event  of  complete  non-performance  by  the  Company's
customers,  the  maximum  exposure to the  Company is the  outstanding  accounts
receivable balance at the date of non-performance.

At  December  31,  2005 and 2004,  UPG had  receivables  due from a  significant
customer that comprised  approximately 47% and 46%,  respectively,  of the total
trade receivables,  respectively. Through the date of this report, substantially
all of these amounts have been  collected.  During the years ended  December 31,
2005,  2004 and 2003,  one UPG customer  accounted for 55%, 51% and 50% of total
revenues and another in December 2003 accounted for 10% of UPG's revenue.

The loss of these significant  customers would materially decrease the Company's
total revenue.

A  significant  portion  of UPG's  inventory  purchases  are from two  suppliers
representing approximately 44% and 22% for the year ended December 31, 2005, and
approximately  44% and 19%  for  the  similar  period  in  2004.  UPG  purchased
approximately  70% and  61%  for  years  ending  December  31,  2005  and  2004,
respectively  of  its  product  through  domestic  sources  with  the  remainder
purchased  from  international  sources,  predominantly  in the  Pacific Rim and
mainland China.  The majority of UPG's  international  purchases are coordinated
through an independent  consultant.  The Company does not anticipate any changes
in the relationships with this consultant or these suppliers; however, if such a
change were to occur, the Company has alternative sources available.

NOTE J - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

At December 31, 2005 and 2004,  the  carrying  value of the  Company's  accounts
receivable,  accounts  payable and accrued  liabilities  approximate  fair value
because of their short-term nature.

The line of credit and long-term  debt carrying  values  approximate  fair value
based on the borrowing rates  currently  available to the Company for loans with
similar  terms  and  because  of  the  relative   short-term   nature  of  these
instruments.

NOTE K - STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

Compensatory stock options

On July 19, 1995, the Board of Directors  approved the 1995 Incentive Stock Plan
("1995  Plan")  which  provided for 125,000  common  stock  options to be issued
through  December 31, 1999. At December 31, 2005 the 1995 Plan expired and there
are no options  outstanding  pursuant to the 1995 Plan. At December 31, 2004 and
2003, there were 49,500 options outstanding under the 1995 Plan.

On August 13, 1999,  the Board of Directors  approved the 1999  Incentive  Stock
Option Plan ("1999 Plan") which  provided for 1,300,000  common stock options to
be issued.  At December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, there are 1,059,500,  1,010,000
and 1,140,000 options, respectively, outstanding under the 1999 Plan.

On June 24, 2000,  the Board of  Directors  approved  the 2000  Incentive  Stock
Option Plan ("2000  Plan") under which  2,000,000  common  stock  options may be
issued.  At December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, there are 0, 0 and 25,000 options,
respectively, outstanding under the 2000 Plan.

The Board of Directors of the Company determines for all option grants, the term
of each option,  the option  exercise  price  within  limits set forth under the
option plans, the number of shares for which each option is granted and the rate
at which each option is exercisable.

A summary of the  Company's  compensatory  stock  option plans as of and for the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are as follows:

The weighted  average  grant-date fair value for the options granted during 2005
was $0.60 per  share.  This  estimate  was made using the  Black-Scholes  option
pricing model with the following  assumptions:  dividend  yield of 0%;  expected
volatility of 111%; risk-free interest rate of 3%; and expected life of 4 years.

At December 31, 2005 there are 1,059,500  compensatory stock options outstanding
with a  weighted-average  exercise price of $0.84 and all of these  compensatory
stock options are exercisable.  The weighted-average  remaining contractual life
of the compensatory  options outstanding and exercisable  approximated 3.6 years
at December 31, 2005.

Other Options

37,500  Stock  options  granted  pursuant to a severance  agreement in 1999 were
exercised  on October 31,  2005 at an  exercise  price $0.75 per share for total
proceeds  of  $28,125.   There  are  no  other  non-compensatory  stock  options
outstanding at December 31, 2005.

the  terms of the lease  from  February  1,  2004 to  December  31,  2009.  This
amendment  included  increased space, a rent holiday for six months during 2004,
leasehold   incentives   including   build-out  of  the  facility  that  totaled
approximately  $134,000,  and rent price  escalation  throughout the term of the

NOTE P - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On February 23, 2006, Caspic, a company affiliated to William Tan, exercised its
warrants,  discussed in Notes F and K, and  purchased  250,000  shares of common
stock of the Company at an exercise  price of $0.73 per share.  Caspic  assigned
its 250,000  shares of common  stock of the  Company to Ventures  International,
Inc., of which William Tan is a director and officer.

On March 9, 2006,  the notes payable to related party  financing  companies with
outstanding  balances  at December  31,  2005  totaling  $138,792  and  $78,336,
respectively, discussed in Notes E and F were paid in full.

On March 23,  2006,  UPG entered into renewal and  modification  agreement  with
Compass Bank. The advance  formula  referenced in the Security  Agreement as the
"Borrowing  Base" was modified as follows:  eighty-five  percent  (85.0%) of the
outstanding value of Borrower's  Eligible Accounts Receivable (as defined in the
Security  Agreement),  plus fifty  percent  (50.0%)  of the value of  Borrower's
Eligible  Inventory (as defined in the Security  Agreement);  provided,  however
that the  foregoing  sub-limit  upon  availability  with  respect to  Borrower's
Eligible  Inventory  shall  not  exceed  eighty-five   percent  (85.0%)  of  the
outstanding  value of Borrower's  Eligible  Accounts  Receivable at any one time
outstanding.  The Renewal and  Modification  Agreement  gives UPG more borrowing
availability and flexibility for borrowings.

Exhibit 10.13

                       RENEWAL AND MODIFICATION AGREEMENT
                       ----------------------------------

         THIS RENEWAL AND MODIFICATION  AGREEMENT (this  "Modification") is made
by and between UNIVERSAL POWER GROUP,  INC., a Texas  corporation  ("Borrower"),
and COMPASS BANK ("Lender"), to be effective as of the ___ day of _______, 2006,
but entered into as of the ____ day of March, 2006.

                                    RECITALS:

         WHEREAS,  Borrower  executed  and  delivered  to  Lender  that  certain
Revolving Credit and Security Agreement,  dated December 14, 2004 (the "Security
Agreement"),   covering   certain  items  of  collateral   and  property   being
specifically  described in the Security  Agreement  (all of such property  being
hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Property"); and

         WHEREAS,  the  Security  Agreement  secures  in part  the  indebtedness
evidenced by that certain  Revolving Note,  dated of even date with the Security
Agreement,  in the original stated principal amount of Twelve Million and No/100
Dollars  ($12,000,000.00)  (the  "Principal  Amount"),  executed by Borrower and
payable  to  Lender  (as may have  been  heretofore  renewed,  extended,  and/or
modified, the "Promissory Note"); and

         WHEREAS, the Borrower has obligations (collectively, the "Obligations")
under the  Promissory  Note,  Security  Agreement,  and other Loan Documents (as
defined below) (the  indebtedness  evidenced by the Promissory Note (as modified
by the First Amendment (defined below), is referred to herein as the "Loan", and
the Promissory Note, Security Agreement, and all other Loan documents evidencing
the Loan are herein collectively, the "Loan Documents"); and

         WHEREAS,  the parties desire to further modify the terms of the Loan as
the same  relate to  certain of  Borrower's  covenants,  agreements,  duties and
obligations  under the Security  Agreement and other terms and conditions of the
Loan.

                                   AGREEMENTS:

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  for and in  consideration of the mutual covenants and
agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration,  the
receipt and  sufficiency of which are hereby  acknowledged,  Borrower and Lender
hereby agree as follows:

         1. The parties acknowledge that Borrower's duties and obligations under
the Promissory Note (as hereby renewed) to repay the Principal Amount,  together
with  accrued  interest,   shall  be  included  within  the  definition  of  the
Obligations as herein specified, all in accordance with the terms and conditions
herein contained.

2.  From the date  hereof,  Borrower  promises  to pay to Lender  the  Principal
Amount,  together with interest  thereon,  and to perform all of the Obligations
under the Loan Documents (as hereby modified) including,  without limitation the
payment  of all  outstanding  principal  together  with all  accrued  but unpaid
interest  on the  Maturity  Date (as  defined in the  Security  Agreement).  The
Principal Amount shall accrue interest and be due and payable in accordance with
and as specified within the Promissory Note.

                                    10.13-1
 
         3. In addition to the foregoing,  the parties hereby further agree that
the advance formula referenced in the Security Agreement as the "Borrowing Base"
shall  be  modified  hereby  as  follows:  eighty-five  percent  (85.0%)  of the
outstanding value of Borrower's  Eligible Accounts Receivable (as defined in the
Security  Agreement),  plus fifty  percent  (50.0%)  of the value of  Borrower's
Eligible  Inventory (as defined in the Security  Agreement);  provided,  however
that the  foregoing  sub-limit  upon  availability  with  respect to  Borrower's
Eligible  Inventory  shall  not  exceed  eighty-five   percent  (85.0%)  of  the
outstanding  value of Borrower's  Eligible  Accounts  Receivable at any one time
outstanding. All references to the term Borrowing Base in the Security Agreement
shall, after date hereof, refer to the advance formula specified above.

         4. Borrower hereby conveys and/or re-conveys,  grants and/or re-grants,
and makes and/or re-makes, each as applicable,  to Lender the security interests
and liens upon the Property remaining subject to the Loan Documents and securing
the  Obligations.  Further,  Borrower hereby  covenants and agrees that Borrower
shall not sell,  transfer,  convey or  otherwise  dispose of any of the Property
without Lender's prior written consent (except as otherwise  permitted under the
Security Agreement), and, in the event such consent by Lender is given, Borrower
shall  provide  Lender  with  such  additional  security  with  respect  to  the
Obligations as Lender shall require in its sole and absolute discretion.

         5. Borrower  hereby  renews,  but does not  extinguish,  the Promissory
Note,  Loan, and the liens and security  interests  created and evidenced by the
Security  Agreement  and all other liens and  security  interests  securing  the
Promissory Note (including, without limitation, any vendor's lien), and Borrower
promises to pay to the order of Lender,  the principal sum of the Loan evidenced
by the Promissory  Note, or so much thereof as may be advanced and  outstanding,
together with interest at the rate and in the manner specified in the Promissory
Note, as modified herein, and to observe, comply with and perform each and every
of the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents as herein modified.

         6.  Borrower  hereby  reaffirms the liens on the Property and any other
liens securing the Promissory  Note and/or Loan until the  indebtedness  and the
Promissory Note and Loan as modified and renewed hereby has been fully paid, and
agrees  that the  modification  set forth  herein  shall in no manner  affect or
impair the Promissory  Note, Loan, or the liens securing the same, and that said
liens shall not in any manner be waived,  the purpose of this  instrument  being
simply  to  modify  the  Security  Agreement  (and  other  Loan  Documents,   as
appropriate)  and to carry  forward  all  liens  securing  the  same,  which are
acknowledged  by Borrower to be valid and  subsisting.  Borrower  further agrees
that all terms and  provisions of the  Promissory  Note and of the instrument or
instruments  creating or fixing the liens  securing the same shall be and remain
in full force and  effect as  therein  written,  except as  otherwise  expressly
provided  herein.  All  liens  are  hereby  carried  forward  from the  original
inception thereof,  and Borrower hereby ratifies,  reaffirms and confirms all of
said liens from the original  inception thereof.  Except as otherwise  specified
herein,  the terms and  provisions  hereof  shall in no  manner  impair,  limit,
restrict, or otherwise affect the obligations of Borrower or any guarantor under
the Loan  Documents.  As a material  inducement to Lender to execute and deliver
this Modification, Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that Borrower is well
and truly indebted to Lender in the amount set forth  hereinabove,  and that the
liens,  security interests and assignments created by the Security Agreement and
any other Loan Documents are, respectively, valid and subsisting liens, security
interests, and assignments, and, to the best of Borrower's knowledge, are of the

10.13-2
 
validity  and  priority  recited in the  Security  Agreement  and the other Loan
Documents.  As a further  material  inducement  to Lender to execute and deliver
this  Modification,  Borrower  hereby  acknowledges  that there are no claims or
offsets  against,  or defenses or  counterclaims  to, the terms or provisions or
other  obligations  created or evidenced by the Loan  Documents,  and  represent
that,  after  modification  of the Security  Agreement and other Loan  Documents
hereunder, no event has occurred, and no condition exists which would constitute
a default,  either with or without  notice or lapse of time, or both,  under the
Loan Documents.

         7.  Borrower  reaffirms  and  remakes,  as  of  the  date  hereof,  all
representations  and  warranties  contained  in the  Promissory  Note,  Security
Agreement,  and other Loan Documents.  Borrower further  represents and warrants
that,  except as disclosed in writing to Lender,  it has done  nothing,  nor has
allowed  anything,  to adversely affect title to or encumber the Property or any
other  property of Borrower in which  Lender has a security  interest.  Borrower
further  represents  and  warrants to Lender that it is aware of no condition or
fact, which has not been disclosed in writing to Lender,  which would materially
adversely  affect the  repayment to Lender of all sums due under the  Promissory
Note, Security Agreement, and other Loan Documents.

         8. Borrower,  for it and its successors,  assigns,  and representatives
does hereby  waive,  release,  and discharge  Lender and its agents,  employees,
officers,  directors, and attorneys (collectively,  the "Released Parties") from
any and all of Lender's  duties,  obligations,  and  liabilities  arising under,
based upon or associated with, directly or indirectly,  the Loan, the Promissory
Note,  Security  Agreement,  and any Loan Documents,  existing as of the date of
this  Modification,  and further does hereby waive any and all claims and causes
of action of any kind or  character,  arising  under,  based upon, or associated
with,  directly or  indirectly,  the Loan  Documents  or the acts,  actions,  or
omissions of the Released  Parties in connection  therewith,  existing as of the
date hereof, whether known or unknown,  asserted or unasserted,  equitable or at
law,   arising  under  or  pursuant  to  common  or  statutory  law,  rules,  or
regulations.

         9.  Borrower  hereby  ratifies,  reaffirms  and  confirms  any  and all
covenants,  agreements,  or  promises  heretofore  made by Borrower to Lender in
connection with the Loan,  Promissory Note,  Security  Agreement,  or other Loan
Documents, and all renewals thereof, including as hereby modified.

         10. Borrower agrees,  simultaneously  with and as a condition precedent
to the  execution  hereof,  to pay to Lender  all costs and  expenses  of Lender
incurred  in  connection  with  the  preparation  and   administration  of  this
Modification,  including,  the cost of any recording fees and charges associated
with the Security Agreement and/or other Loan Documents, and Lender's attorneys'
fees and expenses.

         11. It is hereby agreed and  acknowledged  that other parties,  if any,
who are liable in any part for the Obligations,  including,  without limitation,
Zunicom, Inc., a Texas corporation, in its capacity as guarantor of the Loan and
Obligations, are in no way released or discharged from such Obligations, nor are
Lender's rights against such persons or entities  waived or negatively  impacted
by the execution of this Modification.

10.13-3
 
         12. The parties agree that all clauses  contained in the Loan Documents
which relate to the payment,  application, and spreading of interest received by
Lender which may be greater than the maximum amount  allowed by applicable  law,
shall  remain  in  full  force  and  effect  and  by  this  reference  be  fully
incorporated herein.

         13. If any provision of this  Modification  or application to any party
or circumstance shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid and  unenforceable to any extent,  the remainder of this Modification or
the  application of such provision to such person or  circumstances,  other than
those as to which it is so  determined  invalid or  unenforceable,  shall not be
affected thereby, and each provision hereof shall be valid and shall be enforced
to the fullest extent permitted by law.

         14. Except  as amended hereby, the Promissory Note, Security Agreement,
and other Loan Documents remain unmodified and in full force and effect.

         15. THE LOAN,  PROMISSORY NOTE, SECURITY  AGREEMENT,  AND OTHER WRITTEN
LOAN DOCUMENTS, AS MODIFIED BY THIS MODIFICATION,  REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT
BETWEEN  BORROWER AND LENDER,  AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR,
CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES.

         THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN BORROWER AND LENDER.

         other  employees  who  have a  significant  role  in  the  registrant's
         internal control over financial reporting.
