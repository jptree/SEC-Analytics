NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)

1. INTERIM FINANCIAL REPORTING

This financial  information  has been prepared in conformity with the accounting
principles and practices  reflected in the financial  statements included in the
annual report filed with the  Commission  for the preceding  fiscal year. In the
opinion  of  management,   the  accompanying  unaudited  consolidated  financial
statements  contain all  adjustments  necessary to present  fairly Lazare Kaplan
International  Inc.'s  operating  results for the six months ended  November 30,
1996 and 1995 and the financial position as of November 30, 1996.

The operating  results for the interim  periods  presented  are not  necessarily
indicative of the operating results for a full year.

2. TAXES

The Company's subsidiaries  do business  in foreign countries.  The subsidiaries
are  not  subject  to  federal income  taxes  and  their  provisions  have  been
determined based upon the effective tax rates, if any, in the foreign countries.

Deferred  income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary  differences
between the carrying  amounts of assets and liabilities for financial  reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes,  and (b)  operating  loss
carryforwards.  At November  30,  1996,  the  Company's  net deferred tax asset,
relating primarily to operating loss carryforwards, was approximately $7,400,000
less a valuation  allowance  of  approximately  $7,400,000  resulting  in no net
deferred  tax asset.  These  amounts are reduced as the Company  recognizes  net
operating loss carryforwards during the period.

For the six months ended November 30, 1996, the Company recognized approximately
$5,300,000 of net operating  loss  carryforwards  to offset  Federal,  state and
local income taxes.

                                       5

Taxes (continued)

At November 30, 1996,  the Company has available  U.S. net  operating  losses of
$14.2 million which expire as follows:

3. Credit Facilities

In September  1996,  the Company  entered into a loan  agreement with one of its
banks  providing for an additional  seasonal  short-term line of credit of up to
$8.0  million,  with an  interest  rate equal to any one of a) one eighth of one
percent  above the bank's  prime rate,  b) two and  one-half  percent  above the
London  Interbank  Offered Rate, or c) two and one-half percent above the bank's
cost of funds  rate,  depending  on the  method  of  borrowing  selected  by the
Company.  The  Company  had a  balance  of  $2,750,000  outstanding  under  this
agreement at November 30, 1996.  All amounts  borrowed  under this agreement are
due and payable on January 31, 1997.

In November 1996, the Company's  long-term  unsecured,  revolving loan agreement
was amended to increase  the amount the Company may borrow from  $27,500,000  to
$35,500,000. At November 30, 1996, there was an aggregate balance outstanding of
$27,500,000 under this loan agreement.

4. Common Stock Offering

On December 12, 1996, the Company  completed an offering of 1,800,000  shares of
its  common  stock at a price of  $17.00  per  share.  The net  proceeds,  after
offering expenses,  were approximately $28.3 million. The Company intends to use
the net proceeds to prepay all or a portion of the Company's  outstanding Senior
Notes and to repay a portion of its outstanding revolving bank loans.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
         CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

INTRODUCTION

      Except for the  historical  information  contained  herein,  the following
discussion   contains   forward-looking   statements   that  involve  risks  and
uncertainties.  The Company's actual results could differ  materially from those
discussed  herein.  Factors that could cause or contribute  to such  differences
include,  but are not limited to, those  discussed in Item 1 -  "Description  of
Business"  and  elsewhere in the  Company's  Annual  Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended May 31, 1996.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

NET SALES

Net sales during the six months ended  November 30, 1996 of $149.7  million were
$15.7  million,  or 12%, above the $134.0 million in sales during the comparable
period  last year.  For the three  month  period  ended  November  30, net sales
increased  11% to $80.3  million from $72.3  million in the second  quarter last
year.

Revenue from the sale of polished  diamonds  increased 12% to $51.2 million from
$45.9 million during the comparable six month period. For the three month period
ended November 30,  polished  diamond sales  increased 28% to $33.1 million from
$25.9 million. These increases were attributable to continued growth of polished
diamond  sales in the  United  States  and  Southeast  Asia and,  in the  second
quarter,  also as a result  of  increased  shipments,  a portion  of which  were
delayed from the first  quarter,  of large polished  diamonds  received from the
Company's facility in Russia.

Rough sales  increased to $98.4  million for the six months  ended  November 30,
1996 from $88.1  million a year ago.  Rough sales  increased 2% to $47.2 million
for the three months ended November 30. The increases from the prior year were a
result of the growth of the Company's rough buying  operations in Africa.

GROSS PROFIT

Gross  margin on net  polished  sales for the six months and three  months ended
November 30, 1996 was 19.1% and 19.7%,  respectively.  This was an increase from
the margins of 14.2% and 13.4%, respectively, during the same periods last year.
These  increases were  primarily a result of an increased  number of larger size
stones sold (which  historically  have higher  margins) in the current  year and
polished  diamond price increases  implemented  earlier in the year. The overall
(both  polished and rough  diamond)  gross margin on net sales for the six month
and three

ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
          CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

month  periods  ended  November 30, 1996 was 8.9% and 9.7%,  respectively.  This
compares to 7.8% and 8.0%,  respectively,  for the same periods  last year.  The
overall margin  increases were due primarily to the  improvement of the polished
diamond gross margin as compared with last year.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Selling,  general and administrative  expenses for the six months ended November
30, 1996 were $6.5 million,  compared to $5.8 million for this period last year.
During  the three  months  ended  November  30,  expenses  were $3.5  million as
compared  to $3.0  million  in the prior  year.  The  increases  were  primarily
attributable  to  higher  consulting  and  legal  expenses  associated  with the
development of expansion opportunities, as well as higher selling commissions as
a result of higher polished sales in the current year.

INTEREST EXPENSE

Interest  expense  for the six month  period  ended  November  30, 1996 was $2.3
million  compared to $2.1 million last year and $1.4 million in the three months
ended  November  30,  1996  compared  to $1.1  million  in the prior  year.  The
increases  were a result  of  higher  average  balances  outstanding  under  the
Company's revolving loans and lines of credit in the current year.

NET INCOME PER SHARE

Income per share is  computed  based on the  weighted  average  number of shares
outstanding including,  as appropriate,  the assumed  exercise  of  all dilutive
stock options, during each period.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company's working capital at November 30, 1996 was $79.6 million,  which was
$5.5 million  greater than its working capital at May 31, 1996. The increase was
due to  higher  inventories  and  accounts  receivable  partially  offset  by an
increase in short-term borrowings in the current year.

On December 12, 1996, the Company  completed an offering of 1,800,000  shares of
its common stock. The Company intends to use the net proceeds to prepay all or a
portion  of  its  outstanding  Senior  Notes  and  to  repay  a  portion  of its
outstanding  revolving bank loans. In addition,  during the second quarter ended
November 30, 1996, the Company's  long-term  unsecured,  revolving loan facility
was increased from  $27,500,000 to  $35,500,000. In September  1996, the Company
also entered into a loan agreement

with one of its banks  providing for an additional  seasonal  short-term line of
credit of up to $8.0 million which matures on January 31, 1997.

The Company believes that it has the ability to meet its current and anticipated
financing needs for the next twelve months.

Stockholders' equity was $50.0 million at November 30, 1996 as compared to $44.9
million at May 31, 1996. No dividends were paid to  stockholders  during the six
months ended November 30, 1996.
