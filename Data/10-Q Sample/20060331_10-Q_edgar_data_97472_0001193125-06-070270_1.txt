Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)      Texas Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries (unless the context
indicates otherwise, collectively, the  Company  or  TXI ) is a leading supplier of construction materials. On July 29, 2005, the Company completed the spin-off of its steel segment in the form of a pro-rata, tax-free
dividend to the Company s shareholders of one share of Chaparral Steel Company ( Chaparral ) common stock for each share of the Company s stock that was owned on July 20, 2005. The Company s continuing operations
constitute a single business segment which produces and sells cement, stone, sand and gravel, ready-mix concrete, expanded shale and clay aggregate, and other products from facilities concentrated in Texas, Louisiana and California.      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES      The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule
10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of
normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the nine-month period ended February 28, 2006, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year
ended May 31, 2006. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K dated November 15, 2005.       Principles of Consolidation . The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Texas Industries, Inc. and all subsidiaries except a
subsidiary trust in which the Company has a variable interest but is not the primary beneficiary. As a result of the spin-off of the steel segment the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to present the steel segment as
discontinued operations. See  Discontinued Operations  footnote on pages 18 and 19. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts in the accompanying footnotes relate to continuing operations.       Estimates . The preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates.       Cash
and Cash Equivalents . Investments with maturities of less than 90 days when purchased are classified as cash equivalents and consist primarily of money market funds and investment grade commercial paper issued by major corporations and financial
institutions.       Short-Term Investments.  The Company s short-term investments consist of investment grade auction rate securities
with an active resale market to ensure liquidity and the ability to be readily converted into cash to fund current operations, or satisfy other cash requirements as needed. These securities have legal maturities ranging from 19 to 38 years, but have
their interest rates reset at predetermined intervals, typically less than 30 days, through an auction process. These securities are expected to be sold within one year, regardless of their legal maturity date. Accordingly, these securities have
been classified as available-for-sale and as current assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of February 28, 2006. The auction rate securities are stated at cost plus accrued interest which approximates fair value. Net unrealized gains and
losses, net of deferred taxes, are not significant due to the short duration between interest rate reset dates. Purchase and sale activity of short-term investments is presented as cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statements
of cash flows.       Receivables.  Management evaluates the ability to collect accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. A
reserve for doubtful accounts is maintained based on the length of time receivables are past due or the status of a customer s financial condition. If the Company is aware of a specific customer s inability to make required payments,
specific amounts are added to the reserve.       Environmental Liabilities.  The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations
established by federal, state and local authorities, and makes provision for the estimated costs related to compliance when it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability has been incurred.       Legal Contingencies.  The Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in lawsuits which arose in the normal course of business, and make provision
for the estimated loss from any claim or legal proceeding when it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability has been incurred.

    Long-lived Assets.  Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable and would record an impairment charge if necessary. Such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for the Company s products, capital needs, economic trends and other factors.      Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost. Provisions for depreciation are computed generally using the straight-line method. Provisions for depletion of mineral deposits are computed on the basis of the
estimated quantity of recoverable raw materials. Useful lives for the Company s primary operating facilities range from 10 to 25 years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.       Goodwill . Management tests goodwill for impairment at least annually by reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its fair
value an impairment loss is recognized. In applying a fair-value-based test, estimates are made of the expected future cash flows to be derived from the reporting unit. Similar to the review for impairment of other long-lived assets, the resulting
fair value determination is significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for the Company s products, capital needs, economic trends and other factors. Goodwill having a carrying value of $58.4 million at February 28, 2006 and $61.3
million at May 31, 2005 resulted from the acquisition of Riverside Cement Company and is identified with the Company s California cement operations. During the nine-month period ended February 28, 2006 goodwill was adjusted to
recognize a deferred tax asset in the amount of $2.9 million related to the acquisition. The fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value.       Real Estate and Investments.  Surplus real estate and real estate acquired for development of high quality industrial, office or multi-use parks totaled $8.1 million at February 28, 2006 and $9.2 million at
May 31, 2005.      Investments are composed primarily of life insurance contracts purchased in connection with certain Company benefit
plans. The contracts, recorded at their net cash surrender value, totaled $95.9 million (net of distributions of $1.3 million) at February 28, 2006 and $89.4 million (net of distributions of $1.3 million) at May 31, 2005. During the
nine-month period ended February 28, 2005 distributed amounts totaling $51.2 million were repaid.       Deferred Charges and
Intangibles.  Deferred charges are composed primarily of debt issuance costs that totaled $11.6 million at February 28, 2006 and $17.3 million at May 31, 2005. The costs are associated with various debt issues and amortized over the
term of the related debt.      Intangibles are composed of non-compete agreements and other intangibles with finite lives being amortized on a
straight-line basis over periods of 7 to 15 years. Their carrying value, adjusted for write-offs, totaled $1.5 million (net of accumulated amortization of $2.9 million) at February 28, 2006 and $1.8 million (net of accumulated amortization of
$2.6 million) at May 31, 2005. Amortization expense incurred was $300,000 in both nine-month periods ended February 28, 2006 and 2005. Estimated amortization expense for each of the five succeeding years is $300,000 per year.   
   Other Credits.  Other credits composed primarily of liabilities related to the Company s retirement plans, deferred compensation agreements
and asset retirement obligations totaled $60.4 million at February 28, 2006 and $57.8 million at May 31, 2005.       Asset
Retirement Obligations.  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 143,  Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,  which applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets,
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of
the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The liability is accreted at the end of each period through a charge to operating expense. A gain or loss on settlement is recognized if the
obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability.      The Company incurs legal obligations for asset retirement as
part of its normal operations related to land reclamation, plant removal and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act closures. Determining the amount of an asset retirement liability requires estimating the future cost of contracting with third
parties to perform the obligation. The estimate is significantly impacted by, among other considerations, management s assumptions regarding the scope of the work required, labor costs, inflation rates, market-risk premiums and closure dates.

   Changes in the Company s asset retirement obligations are as follows:       
     Pension Liability Adjustment.  The pension liability adjustment to shareholders  equity
of $7.7 million (net of tax of $4.2 million) at both February 28, 2006 and May 31, 2005 relates to a defined benefit retirement plan covering approximately 600 employees and retirees of the Company s California cement subsidiary.
Comprehensive income or loss consists of net income or loss and the pension liability adjustment to shareholders  equity. Comprehensive income (loss) was the same as net income (loss) for the three-month and nine-month periods ended
February 28, 2006 and 2005.       Net Sales.  The Company recognizes sales when title has transferred and products are delivered. All
of the Company s sales were made in the United States during the periods presented. The Company includes delivery fees in the amount it bills customers to the extent needed to recover the Company s cost of freight and delivery. Net sales
are presented as revenues including these delivery fees. The following is a summary of net sales by product.       
     Other Income.  Routine sales of surplus operating assets and real estate resulted in gains
of $3.0 million and $3.8 million in the three-month periods ended February 28, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $7.6 million and $8.5 million in the nine-month periods ended February 28, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition, other
income in the nine-month period ended February 28, 2006 includes a gain of $3.8 million resulting from the sale of certain investment assets. Other income in the nine-month period ended February 28, 2005 includes a gain of $6.2 million
resulting from the sale of emissions credits associated with the Company s expanded shale and clay operations in south Texas.          Income Taxes . Accounting for income taxes uses the liability method of recognizing and classifying deferred income taxes. The Company joins in filing a consolidated return with its subsidiaries. Current and deferred tax expense is
allocated among the members of the group based on a stand-alone calculation of the tax of the individual member.       Earnings Per Share
 ( EPS ). Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period including certain contingently issuable shares.      Contingently issuable shares relate to deferred compensation agreements in which directors elected to defer annual and meeting fees and vested shares
under the Company s former stock awards program. The deferred compensation is denominated in shares of the Company s common stock and issued in accordance with the terms of the agreement subsequent to retirement or separation from the
Company or with the approval of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The shares are considered contingently issuable because the director has an unconditional right to the shares to be issued. Vested stock award shares are issued in
the year in which the employee reaches age 60.

   Diluted EPS adjusts income from continuing operations and the outstanding shares for the dilutive effect
of convertible subordinated debentures, stock options and awards.      Basic and Diluted EPS are calculated as follows:       
     Stock-based Compensation.  The Company accounts for employee stock options using the
intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees  as allowed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 123,  Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation.  Generally, no expense is recognized related to the Company s stock options because the exercise price of each option is set at the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date the option is
granted.         
   - 9 -   

Table of Contents  

   In accordance with SFAS No. 123, the Company discloses the compensation cost, recognized ratably
over the shorter of the vesting period or required service period, based on the estimated fair value at the date of grant. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant for purposes of the pro forma disclosures using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model. In the nine-month period ended February 28, 2006, the weighted-average fair value of options granted was $20.46 based on weighted average assumptions for dividend yield of .58%, volatility factor of .338,
risk-free interest rate of 4.31% and expected life in years of 6.4.      In addition to grants under its stock option plans, the Company has
provided stock-based compensation to employees and directors under stock appreciation rights contracts, deferred compensation agreements, restricted stock payments and a former stock awards program. Stock compensation expense related to these grants
is included in the determination of net income as reported in the financial statements over the vesting periods of the related grants.      If
the Company had applied the fair value recognition provision of SFAS No. 123, the Company s net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share would have been adjusted to the following pro forma amounts:       
    In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123 (revised
2004),  Share-Based Payment . SFAS No. 123R is a revision of SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock Based Compensation , and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25. Among other items, SFAS No. 123R eliminates the use of
APB Opinion No. 25 and the intrinsic value method of accounting, and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards, in the
financial statements. The current effective date of SFAS No. 123R is the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005, which will be the first quarter of the Company s fiscal year ending May 31, 2007. We currently expect to
adopt SFAS No. 123R effective June 1, 2006 using the  modified prospective  method. Under the modified prospective method, compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date, based on
the requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all share-based payments granted after that date, and based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123R. Financial information
for periods prior to the date of adoption of SFAS No. 123R would not be restated. The Company currently utilizes a standard option pricing model (i.e., Black-Scholes) to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees. While SFAS
No. 123R permits entities to continue to use such a model, the standard also permits the use of a  lattice  model. The Company has not yet determined which model it will use to measure the fair value of awards of equity instruments to
employees upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.         
   - 10 -   

Table of Contents  

   The adoption of SFAS No. 123R will not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial
position. Although the impact of SFAS No. 123R on the Company s results of operations can not be predicted at this time, because it will depend on the number of equity awards granted in the future, as well as the model used to value the
awards, it is expected to have a significant effect on the Company s future results of operations. However, had the Company adopted the requirements of SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact would have approximated the amounts
disclosed in the table above.      SFAS No. 123R also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of
recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods
after the effective date. These future amounts cannot be estimated because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options.       Accounting for Changes in Accounting Principles.  In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 154,  Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,  which is effective for the
Company for reporting changes in accounting principles beginning June 1, 2006. SFAS No. 154 modifies the reporting of a change in accounting principle to require retrospective application to prior periods  financial statements, unless
explicit transition provisions are provided for in new accounting pronouncements or existing pronouncements that are in the transition phase when SFAS No. 154 becomes effective.       Accounting for Mining Stripping Costs.  In March 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on Issue 04-6,  Accounting for
Stripping Costs Incurred during Production in the Mining Industry,  which will become effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2006. EITF 04-06 requires that stripping costs incurred during the production phase of the mine be included
in the costs of the inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are incurred. Although dependent in part on the future level of post-production stripping activity which varies from period to period, the Company does not expect that
the adoption of EITF 04-6 will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.      WORKING CAPITAL
     Working capital totaled $260.1 million at February 28, 2006, compared to $372.8 million at May 31, 2005.      Accounts receivable are presented net of allowances for doubtful receivables of $2.4 million at February 28, 2006 and $2.2 million at May 31,
2005. Provisions for bad debts charged to expense were $500,000 in both nine-month periods ended February 28, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Uncollectible accounts written off amounted to $400,000 and $2.3 million in the nine-month periods ended
February 28, 2006 and 2005, respectively.      Inventories consist of:       
    Inventories are stated at cost (not in excess of market) with approximately 68% of inventories
using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method. If the average cost method (which approximates current replacement cost) had been used, inventory values would have been higher by $17.9 million at February 28, 2006 and $16.8 million at
May 31, 2005.

   In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 151,  Inventory
Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,  which will become effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2006. This standard clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material
should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. In addition, this standard requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead costs to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The Company is
currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its financial position and results of operations.      Accrued interest, wages
and other items consist of:       
    LONG-TERM DEBT      Long-term debt is comprised of the following:       
     Refinancing in Connection with the Spin-off of Chaparral.  In connection with the spin-off
of Chaparral in July 2005 (see  Discontinued Operations  footnote on pages 18 and 19), the Company entered into new financing agreements and purchased the outstanding $600 million aggregate principal amount of its 10.25% senior notes due
2011 ( 10.25% Senior Notes ). On July 6, 2005, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of its new 7.25% senior notes due July 15, 2013 ( 7.25% Senior Notes ) and entered into a new senior secured
revolving credit facility. In addition, Chaparral issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of its new senior notes due 2013 ( Chaparral Senior Notes ) and entered into a separate new senior secured revolving credit facility.
Chaparral used the net proceeds from its note offering and borrowings under its credit facility to pay the Company a dividend of $341.1 million. The Company used the net proceeds from its offering of notes, the dividend paid by Chaparral and
existing cash to purchase for cash all of its outstanding $600 million aggregate principal amount of 10.25% Senior Notes. The Company paid a total of $699.5 million to the holders of the 10.25% Senior Notes, which was comprised of $600 million of
principal, $3.6 million of accrued interest and $95.9 million of make-whole premiums and consent fees. In the current nine-month period, the Company recorded a charge of $107.0 million related to the early retirement of the 10.25% Senior Notes and
old credit facility, consisting of $96.0 million in premiums or consent payments and transaction costs and a write-off of $11.0 million of debt issuance costs and interest rate swap gains and losses associated with the debt repaid. On July 29,
2005, Chaparral became an independent, public company and the Company has no obligations with respect to Chaparral s long-term debt. Chaparral is not a guarantor of any of the Company s indebtedness nor is the Company a guarantor of any
Chaparral indebtedness.

the borrowing availability under the facility. At February 28, 2006, $27.3 million of the facility was utilized to support letters of credit. Amounts drawn under the facility bear interest either at the LIBOR rate plus a margin of 1% to 2%, or
at a base rate (which is the higher of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% and the prime rate) plus a margin of up to 1%. The interest rate margins are subject to adjustments based on the Company s leverage ratio. Commitment fees are payable
currently at an annual rate of 0.375% on the unused portion of the facility. The Company may terminate the facility at any time.      All of
the Company s consolidated subsidiaries have guaranteed the Company s obligations under the credit facility. The credit facility is secured by first priority security interests in all or most of the Company s existing and future
accounts, inventory, equipment, intellectual property and other personal property, and in all of the Company s equity interest in present and future domestic subsidiaries and 66% of the equity interest in any future foreign subsidiaries.
     The credit facility contains covenants restricting, among other things, prepayment or redemption of the Company s new senior notes,
distributions, dividends and repurchases of capital stock and other equity interests, acquisitions and investments, indebtedness, liens and affiliate transactions. The Company is required to comply with certain financial tests and to maintain
certain financial ratios, such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. At February 28, 2006, the Company was in compliance with all of its loan covenants.       Other.  Maturities of long-term debt for each of the five succeeding years are $700,000 for 2007, $1.5 million for 2008 and none for 2009 through 2011. Interest paid was $52.7 million and $66.6 million in the
nine-month periods ended February 28, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest capitalized was $500,000 in the three-month and nine-month periods ended February 28, 2006. No interest was capitalized in the prior year periods.

   CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES      On June 5, 1998, the Company issued $206.2 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5% convertible subordinated debentures due June 30, 2028 (the
 Debentures ). TXI Capital Trust I (the  Trust ), a Delaware business trust 100% owned by the Company, issued 4,000,000 of its 5.5% Shared Preference Redeemable Securities ( Preferred Securities ) to the public for
gross proceeds of $200 million. The combined proceeds from the issuance of the Preferred Securities and the issuance to the Company of the common securities of the Trust were invested by the Trust in the Debentures which are the sole assets of the
Trust. At February 28, 2006, 3,998,744 Preferred Securities, representing an undivided beneficial interest in $199.9 million of the $206.1 million aggregate principal amount of Debentures, were outstanding.      The Debentures are redeemable for cash, at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, under certain circumstances relating to federal income tax matters or
in whole or in part at the option of the Company. Upon any redemption of the Debentures, a like aggregate liquidation amount of Preferred Securities will be redeemed. Debentures are convertible at any time prior to the close of business on
June 30, 2028, at the option of the holder of the Preferred Securities into shares of the Company s common stock. On July 29, 2005, due to the spin-off of Chaparral the conversion rate was adjusted from 0.72218 shares to 0.97468
shares of the Company s common stock for each Preferred Security.      Holders of the Preferred Securities are entitled to receive
cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate of $2.75 per Preferred Security (equivalent to a rate of 5.5% per annum of the stated liquidation amount of $50 per Preferred Security). The Company has guaranteed, on a subordinated basis,
distributions and other payments due on the Preferred Securities, to the extent not paid by the Trust (the  Guarantee ). The Guarantee, when taken together with the obligations of the Company under the Debentures, the Indenture pursuant to
which the Debentures were issued, and the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement of the Trust (including its obligations to pay costs, fees, expenses, debts and other obligations of the Trust, other than with respect to the Preferred Securities and
the common securities of the Trust), provide a full and unconditional guarantee of amounts due on the Preferred Securities. The Preferred Securities do not have a stated maturity date, although they are subject to mandatory redemption upon maturity
of the Debentures on June 30, 2028, or upon earlier redemption.      SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY      Common stock consists of:       
    There are authorized 100,000 shares of Cumulative Preferred Stock, no par value, of which 20,000
shares are designated $5 Cumulative Preferred Stock (Voting), redeemable at $105 per share and entitled to $100 per share upon dissolution. An additional 25,000 shares are designated Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock. The Series B
Preferred Stock is not redeemable and ranks, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, junior to (i) all other series of the Preferred Stock unless the terms of any other series shall provide otherwise and
(ii) the $5 Cumulative Preferred Stock. No shares of Cumulative Preferred Stock or Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock were outstanding as of February 28, 2006. Pursuant to a Rights Agreement, in November 1996, the Company
distributed a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of the Company s Common Stock. Each right entitles the holder to purchase from the Company one two-thousandth of a share of the Series B Junior
Participating Preferred Stock at a price of $122.50, subject to adjustment. The rights will expire on November 1, 2006 unless the date is extended or the rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company pursuant to the Rights Agreement.

   STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION       Stock Option Plans.  The Texas Industries, Inc. 2004 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the  2004 Plan ) provides that, in addition to
other types of awards, non-qualified and incentive stock options to purchase Common Stock may be granted to employees and non-employee directors at market prices at date of grant. Options become exercisable in installments beginning one year after
date of grant and expire ten years later. In addition, non-qualified and incentive stock options remain outstanding under the Company s 1993 Stock Option Plan.      A summary of option transactions for the nine-month period ended February 28, 2006, follows:       
    Non-vested options held by Chaparral s employees and new directors were cancelled on
July 29, 2005 in connection with the spin-off of Chaparral. Options held by the Company s continuing employees and directors and vested options held by Chaparral s employees and new directors were adjusted based on the closing share
prices of the Company and Chaparral on July 29, 2005. Outstanding options expire on various dates to January 18, 2016. The Company has reserved 2,048,995 shares for future awards under the 2004 Plan.       Other Stock-based Compensation.  The Company has provided stock-based compensation to employees and directors under stock appreciation rights
contracts, deferred compensation agreements, restricted stock payments and a former stock awards program. At February 28, 2006, outstanding Stock Appreciation Rights totaled 161,311 shares, deferred compensation agreements payable in cash
totaled 97,826 shares, deferred compensation agreements payable in common stock totaled 4,231 shares and stock awards totaled 10,020 shares. Total charges under these grants and restricted stock payments included in selling, general and
administrative expense were $2.7 million and $1.4 million in the three-month periods ended February 28, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $6.5 million and $4.1 million in the nine-month periods ended February 28, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.      INCOME TAXES      Federal income taxes for the interim periods ended February 28, 2006 and 2005, have been included in the accompanying financial statements on the basis of an estimated annual rate for continuing operations. The
estimated annualized rate for continuing operations does not include the tax impact of the loss on debt retirements and Chaparral spin-off charges. The estimated annualized rate for continuing operations, excluding these charges, is 27.1% for 2006
compared to 21.9% for 2005. The effective rate for discontinued operations is 35% for 2006 and 2005, and reflects Chaparral s allocable share of such tax as prescribed in the tax sharing agreement between the Company and Chaparral. The Company
made income tax payments of $4.3 million and $8.9 million in the nine-month periods ended February 28, 2006 and 2005, respectively.      The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, among other things, allows a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities, which will be phased in from 2005 through 2010. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the
new law on its future taxable income for the applicable years, but does not anticipate a benefit for the current year because of an expected taxable loss for the year.

   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES      The Company is subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, air emissions and wastewater
discharge. The Company believes it is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations; however, from time to time the Company receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and entities
asserting that the Company is or may be in violation of certain environmental laws and regulations. Based on its experience and the information currently available to it, the Company believes that such claims will not have a material impact on its
financial condition or results of operations. Despite the Company s compliance and experience, it is possible that the Company could be held liable for future charges which might be material but are not currently known or estimable. In
addition, changes in federal or state laws, regulations or requirements or discovery of currently unknown conditions could require additional expenditures by the Company.      The Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in lawsuits which arose in the normal course of business. In management s judgment the ultimate liability, if any, from such legal proceedings will not have a
material effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.      In connection with the Company s
spin-off of Chaparral, the Company entered into a separation and distribution agreement and a tax sharing and indemnification agreement with Chaparral. In these agreements, the Company has indemnified Chaparral against, among other things, any
liabilities arising out of the businesses, assets or liabilities retained by the Company and any taxes imposed on Chaparral in connection with the spin-off that result from the Company s breach of its covenants in the tax sharing and
indemnification agreement. Chaparral has indemnified the Company against, among other things, any liabilities arising out of the businesses, assets or liabilities transferred to Chaparral and any taxes imposed on the Company in connection with the
spin-off that result from Chaparral s breach of its covenants in the tax sharing and indemnification agreement.      The Company and
Chaparral have made certain covenants to each other in connection with the spin-off that prohibit the Company and Chaparral from taking certain actions. Pursuant to these covenants: (1) neither the Company nor Chaparral will liquidate, merge,
or consolidate with any other person, sell, exchange, distribute or otherwise dispose of its assets (or those of certain of its subsidiaries) except in the ordinary course of business, or enter into any substantial negotiations, agreements, or
arrangements, or arrangements with respect to any such transaction, during the six months following the distribution date of July 29, 2005; (2) the Company and Chaparral will, for a minimum of two years after the distribution date,
continue the active conduct of the cement or steel business, respectively; (3) neither the Company nor Chaparral will repurchase its stock for two years following the distribution except in certain circumstances permitted by the IRS;
(4) the Company and Chaparral will not take any actions inconsistent with the representations made in the separation and distribution agreement or in connection with the issuance by the Company s tax counsel of its tax opinion with respect
to the spin-off; and (5) the Company and Chaparral will not take or fail to take any other action that would result in any tax being imposed on the spin-off. The Company or Chaparral may take actions inconsistent with these covenants if it
obtains an unqualified opinion of counsel or a private letter ruling from the IRS that such actions will not cause the spin-off to become taxable, except that Chaparral may not, under any circumstances, take any action described in (1) above.

   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS      On December 15, 2004, the Company s board of directors adopted a plan to spin-off the Company s steel operations, which was completed on
July 29, 2005. In anticipation of the spin-off, the Company entered into the following transactions:      The Company formed Chaparral
Steel Company as a wholly-owned subsidiary. On June 25, 2005, the Company contributed to Chaparral all of its subsidiaries engaged in the steel business. On July 6, 2005, the Company contributed or transferred to Chaparral real estate and
transportation assets used in the steel business. Chaparral assumed all liabilities arising out of the steel business and the transferred assets.      At various times the Company settled intercompany indebtedness between and among the Company and its subsidiaries, including its subsidiaries engaged in the steel business. The Company settled these accounts through offsets, contributions
of such indebtedness to the capital of the debtor subsidiaries and other non-cash transfers. By the effective date of the spin-off, the Company had contributed to the capital of Chaparral and its subsidiaries the net intercompany indebtedness owed
to it by Chaparral and its subsidiaries.      On July 6, 2005, the Company issued $250 million principal amount of its 7.25% Senior Notes,
entered into a new $200 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders, and terminated its then existing credit facility. The Company received net proceeds from the note offering of $245.0 million. The terms of the new
7.25% Senior Notes and credit facility are more fully described in the  Long-term Debt  footnote on pages 12 and 13.      On
July 6, 2005, Chaparral issued $300 million principal amount of senior notes and entered into a new $150 million credit facility. Chaparral used the net proceeds from its note offering and borrowings under its credit facility to pay the Company
a dividend of $341.1 million.      On July 6, 2005, the Company used the net proceeds from its offering of notes, the dividend paid by
Chaparral and existing cash to purchase for cash all of its outstanding $600 million principal amount of 10.25% Senior Notes. The Company paid a total of $699.5 million to the holders of the 10.25% Senior Notes, which was comprised of $600 million
of principal, $3.6 million of accrued interest and $95.9 million of make-whole premiums and consent fees.      As a consequence of the
spin-off:      On July 29, 2005, Chaparral became an independent, public company. The Company has no further ownership interest in
Chaparral or in any steel business, and Chaparral has no ownership interest in the Company. In addition, Chaparral is not a guarantor of any of the Company s indebtedness nor is the Company a guarantor of any Chaparral indebtedness. The
Company s relationship with Chaparral is now governed by a separation and distribution agreement and the ancillary agreements described in that agreement. The terms of the agreements are more fully described in the  Legal Proceedings and
Contingent Liabilities  note on page 16.      In the current nine-month period the Company recorded a loss of $107.0 million related to
the early retirement of the 10.25% Senior Notes and old credit facility and incurred $5.4 million in spin-off related charges.      Summarized
financial information for discontinued operations is presented below:

EXHIBIT A       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM      Board of Directors and Shareholders      Texas Industries, Inc.      We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Texas Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 28, 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of operations for the three and nine-month periods ended February 28, 2006 and 2005 and the related consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended February 28, 2006 and 2005. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company s management.      We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope
than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express
such an opinion.      Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the condensed consolidated interim financial
statements referred to above for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.      We have previously audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Texas Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders  equity, and cash flows for the year then ended [not presented herein], and in our report dated August 10, 2005, except for the matters discussed in the last paragraph of the  Discontinued Operations  footnote, as to
which the date is November 11, 2005, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2005, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.      /s/

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS      OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      We are a leading supplier of construction materials. On July 29, 2005, we completed the spin-off of our steel segment in the form of a pro-rata,
tax-free dividend to our shareholders of one share of Chaparral Steel Company ( Chaparral ) common stock for each share of our common stock that was owned on July 20, 2005. As a result of the spin-off, the operating results of the
steel segment prior to the spin-off are presented as discontinued operations. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements footnote entitled  Discontinued Operations  on pages 18 and 19. Our continuing operations constitute a single
business segment which produces and sells cement, stone, sand and gravel, ready-mix concrete, expanded shale and clay aggregate, and other products from facilities concentrated in Texas, Louisiana and California.      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       Net Sales . The following table presents certain sales information regarding our major products.       
    Net sales were $216.8 million in the current three-month period, an increase of $35.7 million or
20% from the prior year period. Total cement sales increased $19.4 million on 20% higher average prices and 3% higher shipments. Total aggregate sales increased $4.4 million on 14% higher average prices and comparable shipments. Total ready-mix
sales increased $12.0 million on 16% higher average prices and 8% higher volume.      Net sales were $679.4 million in the current nine-month
period, an increase of $94.7 million or 16% from the prior year period. Total cement sales increased $34.6 million on 16% higher average prices and 3% lower shipments. Total aggregate sales increased $18.0 million on 7% higher average prices and 12%
higher shipments. Total ready-mix sales increased $38.5 million on 15% higher average prices and 8% higher volume.

   Construction activity in the Texas and California markets we serve remained solid in the current February
2006 quarter. Average prices for our major products continued to improve. Our previously announced cement price increases have begun to be realized as average cement prices increased $5 per ton in the current quarter from the November 2005 quarter.
Throughout the current quarter favorable weather positively impacted shipments. During the prior year quarter abnormally wet weather in both our Texas and California markets negatively impacted shipments.      We believe market conditions should continue to support the price improvement we have experienced.       Cost of Products Sold . Cost of products sold was $179.4 million in the current three-month period and $571.6 million in the current nine-month
period, an increase from the prior year periods of $15.2 million and $63.5 million, respectively. Energy costs, particularly the cost of electricity we use in cement production, moderated in the current February 2006 quarter from the November 2005
quarter but remain well above prior year levels. We experienced no unscheduled major plant downtime in the current quarter reducing maintenance costs from the prior year quarter and offsetting in part the higher energy costs. Unit costs in the prior
year quarter were impacted by cement plant downtime and wet weather.       Selling, General and Administrative.  Selling, general and
administrative expense was $20.5 million in the current three-month period, an increase of $3.0 million from the prior year period primarily as a result of a $1.3 million increase in stock-based compensation and $1.9 million increase in incentive
compensation expense. Selling, general and administrative expense was $58.5 million in the current nine-month period, an increase of $1.5 million from the prior year period primarily as a result of a $2.4 million increase in stock-based
compensation.       Interest.  Interest expense was $7.3 million in the current three-month period, an increase of $1.7 million from the
prior year period. Interest expense was $24.5 million in the current nine-month period, an increase of $8.6 million from the prior year period. Interest expense capitalized on costs incurred for our Oro Grande, California cement plant expansion and
modernization project reduced the amount of interest expense recognized by $500,000 in the current three-month and nine-month periods. Total interest expense to be capitalized related to this project during the upcoming two year construction period
is currently estimated at $25 million.      In connection with the spin-off of Chaparral, we entered into new financing agreements and
purchased the outstanding $600 million aggregate principal amount of 10.25% senior notes due 2011. On July 6, 2005, we issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of new 7.25% senior notes due 2013 and entered into a separate new senior
secured revolving credit facility.      Prior to the spin-off of Chaparral interest was allocated between continuing and discontinued
operations based on the historic use of funds derived from long-term borrowings. Total accrued interest for the three-month period ended February 28, 2005 was $17.8 million, of which $12.2 million was allocated to discontinued operations. Total
accrued interest for the nine-month period ended February 28, 2006 was $29.9 million, of which $5.4 million was allocated to discontinued operations. Total accrued interest for the nine-month period ended February 28, 2005 was $51.9
million, of which $36.1 million was allocated to discontinued operations.       Loss on Debt Retirements and Spin-off Charges.  The
nine-month period ended February 28, 2006 includes a loss of $107.0 million related to the early retirement of our 10.25% senior notes and old credit facility consisting of $96.0 million in make-whole premiums and consent payments plus
transaction costs and a write-off of $11.0 million of debt issuance costs and interest rate swap gains and losses associated with the debt repaid. In addition, we incurred $5.4 million in charges related to the spin-off of Chaparral.

    Other Income.  Other income was $5.3 million in the current three-month period, a decrease of $1.7
million from the prior year period. Other income was $17.6 million in the current nine-month period, a decrease of $2.9 million from the prior year period. Routine sales of surplus operating assets and real estate resulted in gains of $3.0 million
and $3.8 million in the three-month periods ended February 28, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $7.6 million and $8.5 million in the nine-month periods ended February 28, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Other income in the nine-month period
ended February 28, 2006 includes a gain of $3.8 million resulting from the sale of certain investments. Other income in the nine-month period ended February 28, 2005 includes a gain of $6.2 million resulting from the sale of emissions
credits associated with our expanded shale and clay operations in south Texas. Interest income was $1.6 million and $1.0 million in the three-month periods ended February 28, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $4.5 million and $2.0 million in the
nine-month periods ended February 28, 2006 and 2005, respectively.          Income Taxes.  Federal income taxes for the interim
periods ended February 28, 2006 and 2005 have been included in the accompanying financial statements on the basis of an estimated annual rate. The estimated annualized rate does not include the tax impact of the loss on debt retirements and
Chaparral spin-off charges. The estimated annualized rate for continuing operations, excluding these charges, is 27.1% for 2006 compared to 21.9% for 2005. The effective rate for discontinued operations is 35% for 2006 and 2005, and reflects
Chaparral s allocable share of such tax as prescribed in our tax sharing agreement with Chaparral.      The American Jobs Creation Act of
2004, among other things, allows a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities, which will be phased in from 2005 through 2010. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new law on its future taxable income for the
applicable years, but does not anticipate a benefit for the current year because of an expected taxable loss for the year.       Income from
Discontinued Operations   Net of Income Taxes.  As a result of the spin-off of Chaparral, the operating results of our steel segment, including the allocation of certain corporate expenses, have been reclassified and presented as
discontinued operations. The nine-month period ended February 28, 2006 includes steel operations through the July 29, 2005 spin-off date.      LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      In addition to cash and cash equivalents of $80.2 million at
February 28, 2006, our sources of liquidity include cash from operations, proceeds from sales of our short-term investments, borrowings available under our $200 million senior secured revolving credit facility and distributions available from
our investments in life insurance contracts.       Short-term Investments.  Our short-term investments, totaling $48.6 million at
February 28, 2006, consist of investment grade auction rate securities with an active resale market to ensure liquidity and the ability to be readily converted into cash. These securities are expected to be sold within one year to fund current
operations, or satisfy other cash requirements as needed.       Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.  We have available a $200
million senior secured revolving credit facility expiring in July 2010. It includes a $50 million sub-limit for letters of credit. Any outstanding letters of credit are deducted from the borrowing availability under the facility. At
February 28, 2006, $27.3 million of the facility was utilized to support letters of credit. Amounts drawn under the facility bear interest either at the LIBOR rate plus a margin of 1% to 2%, or at a base rate (which is the higher of the federal
funds rate plus 0.5% and the prime rate) plus a margin of up to 1%. The interest rate margins are subject to adjustments based on our leverage ratio.      All of our consolidated subsidiaries, following the spin-off of Chaparral, have guaranteed our obligations under the credit facility. The credit facility is secured by first priority security interests in all or most
of our existing and future accounts, inventory, equipment, intellectual property and other personal property, and in all of our equity interest in present and future domestic subsidiaries and 66% of the equity interest in any future foreign
subsidiaries.      The credit facility contains covenants restricting, among other things, prepayment or redemption of our new 7.25% senior
notes, distributions, dividends and repurchases of capital stock and other equity interests, acquisitions and investments, indebtedness, liens and affiliate transactions. We are required to comply with certain financial tests and to maintain certain
financial ratios, such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. We are in compliance with all of our loan covenants.

    Investments of Life Insurance Contracts.  During the nine-month period ended February 28, 2005
previous distributions received from our investments in life insurance contracts in the amount of $51.2 million were repaid. Approximately $50 million of these funds are available for redistribution at our election.       Contractual Obligations.  The following is a summary of our estimated future payments under our material contractual obligations as of
February 28, 2006.       

(1)  
  Our long-term debt is described in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements footnote entitled  Long-term Debt  on pages 12 and 13. Our outstanding letters of credit
issued under the senior secured revolving credit facility only collateralize payment of recorded liabilities.     

(2)  
  Our convertible subordinated debentures are described in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements footnote entitled  Convertible Subordinated Debentures  on page 14.

(3)  
  We lease certain mobile and other equipment used in our operations under operating leases that may in the normal course of business be renewed or replaced by subsequent leases.
Future payments under leases exclude mineral rights which are insignificant and are generally required only for products produced.     

(4)  
  In December 2005 we renegotiated three long-term contracts for the purchase of coal for use in our cement and expanded shale and clay plants in Texas that now require minimum
amounts of coal be purchased. These future minimum payment amounts exclude transportation surcharges that may be imposed under certain circumstances.     

(5)  
  We have entered into construction and equipment purchase contracts in connection with the expansion and modernization of our Oro Grande, California cement plant. We expect the
project will take at least two years to construct with actual capital expenditures occurring as the work progresses.     

(6)  
  We incur legal obligations for asset retirement as part of our normal operations related to land reclamation, plant removal and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act closures.

(7)  
  We pay benefits under a series of non-qualified defined benefit plans.     

(8)  
  We pay benefits under a health benefit plan covering approximately 600 employees and retirees of our California cement subsidiary. These employees are also covered by a qualified
defined benefit pension plan. We contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws plus additional amounts considered appropriate. We contributed $3.0 million in the nine-month period
ended February 28, 2006.        During the February 2006 quarter, we commenced construction on a project to expand and
modernize our Oro Grande, California cement plant. We plan to expand the Oro Grande plant to approximately 2.3 million tons of advanced dry process cement production capacity annually, and retire the 1.3 million tons of existing, but less
efficient, production after the new plant is commissioned. We expect the Oro Grande project will take at least two years to construct and will cost approximately $358 million excluding capitalized interest related to the project. We expect our
capital expenditures in fiscal year 2006, including those related to the expansion and modernization of our Oro Grande cement plant, to be approximately $120 million.         
   - 30 -   

Table of Contents  

   We expect cash and cash equivalents, cash from operations, proceeds from sales of our short-term
investments, available borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility and available distributions from our investments in life insurance contracts to be sufficient to provide funds for capital expenditure commitments (including the
expansion and modernization of our Oro Grande, California cement plant), scheduled debt payments, working capital needs and other general corporate purposes for at least the next year.       Spin-off of Chaparral.  We entered into a separation and distribution agreement with Chaparral in which we each released the other from all
liabilities existing or arising from all acts and events occurring before the spin-off with respect to our respective businesses. The liabilities released or discharged do not include liabilities arising under or assigned by the separation and
distribution agreement or any ancillary agreement, such as tax liabilities and liabilities to third parties. In the separation and distribution agreement Chaparral assumed all the liabilities related to the steel business and the transferred assets,
and we and Chaparral agreed on the allocation of responsibility for certain employee benefits matters. The separation and distribution agreement also requires that each party indemnify the other against certain liabilities. See Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements footnote entitled  Legal Proceedings and Contingent Liabilities  on page 16.       Cash Flows       Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $54.0 million in the current nine-month period, compared to $94.2 million in the prior year
period. The decrease resulted primarily from the utilization of tax benefits in the prior year and changes in working capital items. Accounts receivable decreased $7.2 million and inventories increased $20.3 million primarily due to normal seasonal
factors. Scheduled interest and tax payments reduced accrued expenses offsetting increased accounts payable due to higher manufacturing cost accruals.      Net cash used for continuing investing activities was $103.7 million in the current nine-month period, compared to $86.5 million in the prior year period. Capital expenditures incurred in connection with the expansion
and modernization of our Oro Grande, California cement plant were $36.1 million up $34.5 million from the prior year period. Capital expenditures for normal replacement and technological upgrades of existing equipment and acquisitions to sustain our
existing operations were $27.5 million, down $4.1 million from the prior year period. In the current year period we invested $48.5 million in auction rate securities. In the prior year period we repaid distributions received from our investments in
life insurance contracts in the amount of $51.2 million.      Net cash used for continuing financing activities was $451.9 million in the
current nine-month period, compared to $28.0 million provided in the prior year period. We purchased $600 million aggregate principal amount of our 10.25% senior notes, paying $96.0 million in make-whole premiums and consent payments plus
transaction costs. To fund the purchase we issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of our new 7.25% senior notes and incurred $7.4 million in debt issuance costs, received a cash dividend of $341.1 million from Chaparral and used $112.3
million of cash and cash equivalents on hand.      Net cash provided by discontinued operations was $330.1 million in the current nine-month
period, compared to $8.6 million used in the prior year period. In connection with our refinancing and spin-off transactions, Chaparral issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes and borrowed $50 million under its new $150
million credit facility. The net proceeds were used to pay us a dividend of $341.1 million.      OTHER ITEMS       Environmental Matters       We are subject to federal,
state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, air emissions and wastewater discharge. We believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations; however, from time to time we
receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and entities asserting that we are or may be in violation of certain environmental laws and regulations. Based on our experience and the information currently available to us,
we believe that such claims will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Despite our compliance and experience, it is possible that we could be held liable for future charges which might be material but are
not currently known or estimable. In addition, changes in federal or state laws, regulations or requirements or discovery of currently unknown conditions could require additional expenditures by us.

    Market Risk       Historically, we have not entered into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Our short-term investments consist of auction rate securities that have their interest rates reset at predetermined
intervals, typically less than 30 days, through an auction process. Due to the short duration between interest rate reset dates, changes in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on their fair value. We have $250 million of 7.25%
fixed-rate senior notes outstanding. The fair value of the debt will vary as interest rates change.      Our operations require large amounts
of energy and are dependent upon energy sources, including electricity and fossil fuels. Prices for energy are subject to market forces largely beyond our control. In December 2005 we renegotiated three contracts for the purchase of coal for use in
our cement and expanded shale and clay plants in Texas. Each contract specifies a fixed price (escalated quarterly or annually) at which we must purchase a minimum amount of coal each calendar year through 2008, and we may purchase additional
amounts up to a specified maximum. We have generally not entered into any long-term contracts to satisfy our natural gas and electricity needs. However, we continually monitor these markets and we may decide in the future to enter into long-term
contracts. If we are unable to meet our requirements for fuel and electricity, we may experience interruptions in our production. Price increases or disruption of the uninterrupted supply of these products could adversely affect our results of
operations.       Critical Accounting Policies       The preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Changes in the facts and
circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting financial statements. The critical accounting policies that affect its more complex judgments and estimates are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
May 31, 2005.       New Accounting Standards       In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued SFAS No. 123R,  Share-Based Payment . SFAS No. 123R is a revision of SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation , and supersedes APB 25. Among other items, SFAS 123R eliminates the use of APB 25 and the intrinsic value method of accounting, and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of
equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards, in the financial statements. The current effective date of SFAS 123R is the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005, which will be the first quarter of our fiscal
year ending May 31, 2007. We currently expect to adopt the SFAS 123R effective June 1, 2006 using the  modified prospective  method. Under the modified prospective method, compensation cost is recognized in the financial
statements beginning with the effective date, based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for all share-based payments granted after that date, and based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS
123R. Financial information for periods prior to the date of adoption of SFAS 123R would not be restated. We currently utilize a standard option pricing model (i.e., Black-Scholes) to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees.
While SFAS 123R permits entities to continue to use such a model, the standard also permits the use of a  lattice  model. We have not yet determined which model we will use to measure the fair value of awards of equity instruments to
employees upon the adoption of SFAS 123R.      The adoption of SFAS 123R will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position.
Although the impact of SFAS 123R on our results of operations cannot be predicted at this time, because it will depend on the number of equity awards granted in the future, as well as the model used to value the awards, it is expected to have a
significant effect on our future results of operations. However, had we adopted the requirements of SFAS 123R in prior periods, the impact would have approximated the amounts disclosed in Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Stock-based
Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.      SFAS 123R also requires that the benefits associated with the tax
deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing
cash flows in periods after the effective date. These future amounts cannot be estimated, because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options.

   In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,  Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB
No. 43, Chapter 4,  which will become effective for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2006. This standard clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material should be expensed as
incurred and not included in overhead. In addition, this standard requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead cost to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. We are currently evaluating the potential
impact of this standard on its financial position and results of operations.      In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,
 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,  which is effective for reporting changes in accounting principles for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2006. SFAS No. 154 modifies the reporting of a change in accounting principle to
require retrospective application to prior periods  financial statements, unless explicit transition provisions are provided for in new accounting pronouncements or existing pronouncements that are in the transition phase when SFAS No. 154
becomes effective.      In March 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on Issue 04-6,  Accounting for Stripping Costs
Incurred during the Production in the Mining Industry,  which will become effective for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2006. EITF 04-06 requires that stripping costs incurred during the production phase of the mine be included in the
cost of the inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are incurred. Although dependent in part on the future level of post-production stripping activity which varies from period to period, we do not expect that the adoption of
EITF 04-6 will have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations.       Cautionary Statement for Purposes of the  Safe
Harbor  Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995       Certain statements contained in this quarterly report

Item 4. Controls and Procedures      The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods. As of the end of the period covered by this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated, with the participation of the Company s management, the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based on the evaluation, which disclosed no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There were no significant changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that have
materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting.      
  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION      
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings      The information required by this item is included in the section of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements entitled  Legal Proceedings and Contingent Liabilities  presented in Part I on page 16 and incorporated herein by reference.      
  Item 1A. Risk Factors       Our business could suffer if cement imports from Mexico or other countries
significantly increase or are sold in the U.S. in violation of U.S. fair trade laws.        In 1989 and 1990, groups of domestic cement
producers, including us, filed antidumping petitions that resulted in the imposition of significant antidumping import duties on imports of gray portland cement and clinker from Mexico and Japan. On March 6, 2006, the governments of the U.S.
and Mexico signed the U.S.-Mexico Agreement on Cement, which settles the 16-year dispute over the U.S. antidumping duty order on imports from Mexico.      During the three-year term of the agreement, Mexican cement producers are allowed to import into the United States up to 3.0 million metric tons of cement and clinker annually, which will be subject to a reduced
import duty of $3.00 per ton. Maximum import levels will be adjusted annually within certain limits to reflect changes in consumption, and will be allowed to increase to higher levels, if needed, to respond to natural disasters such as hurricanes.
The antidumping order will be terminated in 2009 if Mexican producers have complied with the agreement.      The agreement also provides that
U.S. Customs will deposit into an escrow account substantially all of the cash deposits of estimated antidumping duties collected from importers of Mexican cement and clinker. In a separate agreement, the importers and certain producers in the U.S.,
including us, agreed that 50% of the deposits in the escrow account would be distributed to the importers and the remaining 50% would be distributed to the U.S. producers. We expect to receive about 12% of the amounts distributed to the U.S.
producers.      Although we expect the antidumping order against cement and clinker from Japan to remain in effect until at least 2011,
beginning in 2009 unlimited imports from Mexico may enter the U.S. without the imposition of any import duties. In addition, independently owned cement operators can construct new import facilities and begin to purchase cement from other countries,
such as those in Asia, which could compete with domestic producers. An influx of cement or clinker products from countries not subject to antidumping orders, or sales of imported cement or clinker in violation of U.S. fair trade laws, could
materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds       Unregistered Sales of Equity
Securities.  Robert Alpert, a Director of the Company, elected in prior years to defer a portion of his annual and meeting fees under deferred compensation agreements. The compensation so deferred was denominated in shares of the Company s
Common Stock determined by reference to the average market price during the thirty (30) trading days prior to the date of each agreement. Dividends were credited to the account in the form of Common Stock equivalents at a value equal to the
fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of the payment of such dividend. On December 28, 2005, the Company delivered 25,303 unregistered shares of Common Stock in final settlement of the $308,809 of annual and meeting fees deferred
and dividends credited.      The unregistered shares were issued in reliance upon Section 4 (2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended.
