HORIZON MENTAL HEALTH MANAGEMENT, INC.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1.   ORGANIZATION

        Horizon Mental Health Management, Inc. ("Horizon" or the "Company") is
        a contract manager of mental health programs offered by general acute
        care hospitals in the United States. These management contracts are
        generally for terms ranging from three to five years, the majority of
        which have automatic renewal provisions. Horizon currently has offices
        in the Dallas, Texas; San Francisco, California; Chicago, Illinois;
        Tampa, Florida; and Boston, Massachusetts metropolitan areas.

        Horizon was formed in July 1989 for the purpose of acquiring all the
        assets of two companies. One of the companies, known as Horizon Health
        Management Company, had been formed in 1981 and since that time had
        been engaged in the mental health contract management business. The
        other company owned and operated a freestanding psychiatric hospital in
        California. Effective March 1, 1990, the assets constituting the
        contract management business and the psychiatric hospital were
        transferred to Horizon. Horizon sold the freestanding psychiatric
        hospital in 1992.

        A subsidiary of Horizon leased and began operating Mountain Crest
        Hospital ("MCH") in December 1990. In July 1994, Horizon subleased MCH
        to Mental Health Management, Inc. ("MHM") for a period commencing July
        31, 1994 through December 31, 2000. Horizon, which had previously
        guaranteed the obligations under the primary lease, has provided the
        substitute guaranty of MHM to the lessor. Management believes it has
        satisfied the conditions in the primary lease for release of Horizon's
        guaranty. The sublease requires monthly rental payments to Horizon of
        50% of operating cash flow, as defined, subject to a minimum monthly
        payment of $20,000, not to exceed $1,200,000 in the aggregate over the
        sublease life which expires upon expiration of the primary lease on
        December 31, 2000. As of February 28, 1997, Horizon has received
        $723,686 of the $1,200,000 resulting in future receipts of $476,314 to
        be received on or before February 1, 1999 assuming minimum monthly
        payments of $20,000.

        On August 1, 1994 Horizon signed a contract with Horizon Mental Health
        Management, L.L.C. (the "Horizon LLC") to have it manage all of
        Horizon's then existing management contract obligations for a 72.5%
        interest in the Horizon LLC. Prior to March 20, 1995, the remaining
        27.5% interest in the Horizon LLC was held by MHM which signed a
        contract with the Horizon LLC to have it manage all of MHM's then
        existing management contract obligations. Upon completion of its
        initial public offering of common stock, Horizon became contractually
        obligated to acquire the minority interest of MHM in the Horizon LLC.
        March 13, 1995 was the effective date of the initial public offering.
        The acquisition of the minority interest of MHM was effective March 20,
        1995. As such, the Horizon LLC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
        Horizon. Effective September 1, 1995, the Horizon LLC was dissolved and
        its operations combined with Horizon.

On July 31, 1996, Horizon acquired eighty percent (80%) of the
        outstanding common stock of Florida Professional Psychological
        Services, Inc., also known as Professional Psychological Services, Inc.
        ("PPS"). Based in Clearwater, Florida, PPS specializes in full risk,
        capitated managed behavioral health programs and employee assistance
        programs. (See Note 3)

        Effective March 15, 1997, the Company purchased all of the outstanding
        capital stock of Geriatric Medical Care, Inc., a Tennessee corporation
        ("Geriatric"), from the stockholders of Geriatric. Geriatric is a
        contract manager of mental health services for acute care hospitals.
        Geriatric had total revenues of approximately $5.7 million in 1996 and
        currently has 17 management contract locations, of which two are not
        yet in operation at the date of this report. The cash purchase price of
        approximately $4.3 million, which was paid at closing from existing
        cash of the Company, included retiring essentially all of Geriatric's
        outstanding debt. In connection with the stock purchase, the Company
        also agreed to pay an additional $270,000 (which, if required, the 
        Company expects to pay from its available cash) to the sellers in the 
        event a qualifying management contract is signed on or before August
        17, 1997. The purchase price was determined based on negotiations
        between the sellers and the Company.

        Effective March 15, 1997, the Company purchased all of the outstanding
        capital stock of Clay Care, Inc., a Texas corporation ("CCI"), from
        Clayton V. Deardorff. CCI is a contract manager of mental health
        services for acute care hospitals. CCI currently has management
        contracts with five hospitals of which four are in operation and one is
        scheduled to open in April 1997. CCI had total revenues of
        approximately $1.3 million in 1996. The $975,000 cash purchase price
        was determined based on negotiations between the seller and the
        Company. A total of $475,000 of the purchase price was paid at the
        closing from existing cash of the Company. The remaining $500,000 of
        the total purchase price, which the Company also expects to pay from
        available cash, is due ninety (90) days from the closing date, subject
        to reduction under certain circumstances specified in the stock
        purchase agreement.

        BASIS OF PRESENTATION

        The accompanying consolidated balance sheet at February 28, 1997, the
        consolidated statements of operations for the three and six month
        periods ended February 1996 and 1997, and the consolidated statements
        of cash flows for the six months ended February 1996 and 1997 are
        unaudited. These financial statements should be read in conjunction
        with the Company's audited financial statements for the year ended
        August 31, 1996. In the opinion of Company management, the unaudited
        consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting
        only of normal recurring accruals, which the Company considers
        necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position of the
        Company as of February 28, 1997, and the results of operations for the
        three months and six months ended February 1996 and 1997.

        Operating results for the three and six month periods are not
        necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full
        year or any portion thereof.

     2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

        CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS: Cash and short-term investments
        include securities with original maturities of three months or less
        when purchased.

-9-

    10

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT: Property and equipment are recorded at cost.
        Depreciation expense is provided on the straight-line basis over the
        assets' estimated useful lives. The useful life of furniture and
        fixtures and computer equipment are estimated to be five years and
        three years, respectively. Routine maintenance and repair items are
        charged to current operations.

        NET REVENUES: Net revenue is reported at the estimated net realizable
        amounts from contracted hospitals for contract management services
        rendered. Adjustments are accrued on an estimated basis in the period
        the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as
        final settlement is determined.

        Some management contracts include a clause which states that Horizon
        will indemnify the hospital for any third-party payor denials,
        including Medicare. At the time the charges are denied, an allowance
        for 100% of the disputed amount is recorded by Horizon. Management
        believes it has adequately provided for any potential adjustments that
        may result from final settlement of these denials.

        At February 28, 1997, Horizon had management contracts with 31
        hospitals directly or indirectly owned by Columbia/HCA Healthcare
        Corporation ("Columbia/HCA"), of which 27 had programs in operation.
        These 27 contracts accounted for 22.1% of the Company's net revenues
        for the six months ended February 28, 1997. In the aggregate, including
        terminated contracts, revenues generated by hospitals directly or
        indirectly owned by Columbia/HCA accounted for 23.1% of the Company's
        net revenues for the six months ended February 28, 1997. Of the 31
        Columbia/HCA contracts at February 28, 1997, 18 contracts contain a
        provision limiting the number of contracts which Columbia/HCA can
        cancel without cause to 33.3% during any calendar year. The termination
        or non-renewal of all or a substantial part of the management contracts
        with hospitals owned by Columbia/HCA could have a material adverse
        effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of
        operations. In addition, at February 28, 1997, Horizon had eight
        management contracts with hospitals owned by Community Health Systems,
        of which seven had programs in operation and accounted for 5.6% of the
        Company's net revenues for the six months ended February 28, 1997. In
        addition, Horizon had six management contracts with hospitals
        affiliated with tenant, which accounted for 4.2% of the Company's net
        revenues for the six months ended February 28, 1997.

        The customers of Horizon are not concentrated in any specific
        geographic region, but are concentrated in the health care industry.
        Horizon generally does not require collateral to support outstanding
        accounts receivable.

        HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REIMBURSEMENT: Services were provided under
        Horizon's management to patients who are eligible for coverage under
        Title XVIII (Medicare) Health Insurance Programs. Amounts received are
        generally less than the standard billing rates of the hospital and
        receivables are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at the
        estimated amount to be reimbursed.

        Amounts due to/from Health Insurance Programs under Medicare are
        subject to final determination through an audit by a fiscal
        intermediary. Any difference between the final determination and
        estimated amounts accrued is accounted for as an adjustment to patient
        service revenue in the year of final determination. Management believes
        it has adequately provided for any potential adjustments resulting from
        an audit.

                                      -10-

    11

LONG-LIVED AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS: The Company has adopted Statement of
        Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment
        of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed of" (SFAS
        No. 121), effective September 1, 1994. Under SFAS 121, the Company
        recognizes impairment losses on property and equipment whenever events
        or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
        long-lived assets, on an individual property basis, may not be
        recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows. Such losses are
        determined by comparing the sum of the expected future discounted net
        cash flows to the carrying amount of the asset. Impairment losses are
        recognized in operating income as they are determined. As of February
        28, 1997, no impairment losses have been incurred.

        INCOME TAXES: Horizon has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
        Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." SFAS 109
        generally requires an asset and liability approach and requires
        recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from
        differing book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. It requires
        that deferred tax assets and liabilities be determined using the tax
        rate expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the
        deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled.
        Under this method, future financial results will be impacted by the
        effect of changes in income tax rates on cumulative deferred income tax
        balances.

        NET INCOME PER SHARE: Net income per common share is calculated using
        the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares
        outstanding during the respective periods. Dilutive common equivalents
        consist of stock options calculated using the treasury stock method.

        USE OF ESTIMATES: The Company has made a number of estimates and
        assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the
        disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these
        financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
        principles. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

     3. INVESTMENT IN PPS

        On July 31, 1996, Horizon acquired eighty percent (80%) of the
        outstanding common stock of Florida Professional Psychological
        Services, Inc., also known as Professional Psychological Services, Inc.
        ("PPS"), and PPS has been consolidated with Horizon as of August 1,
        1996. Horizon accounted for the acquisition of PPS by the purchase
        method as required by generally accepted accounting principles. Based
        in Clearwater, Florida, PPS specializes in full risk, capitated managed
        behavioral health programs and employee assistance programs. The
        purchase price is based primarily on a multiple of the 1996 pre-tax
        income of PPS. Horizon currently estimates the purchase price will be
        between $2,225,000 and $2,900,000, of which $1,225,000 was paid on July
        31, 1996. Horizon expects to pay an interim amount of $1,000,000 on or
        about March 31 ,1997. The final reconciliation statement of income of
        PPS for the twelve months ended December 31, 1996 is to be delivered
        on or before July 15, 1997, and any remaining purchase price is to be
        paid within 30 days after determination thereof.

        In addition, Horizon also obtained an option to acquire the remaining
        twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding PPS common stock at a future
        date. The sellers, constituting all the shareholders of PPS, also
        obtained the right to put to Horizon such shares on certain dates. The
        option and put prices for the remaining PPS shares are based on a
        multiple of the pre-tax income of PPS in future years.

-11-

    12

For the three and six months ended February 28, 1997, PPS generated
        $1,281,487 and $2,545,184 in gross revenues, respectively, and net
        income of $137,429 and $257,802, respectively.

 4.     LONG-TERM DEBT

        Effective September 29, 1995, the Company entered into a loan agreement
        with Texas Commerce Bank (TCB) for a revolving line of credit with a
        maximum advance commitment of $11,000,000. On December 12, 1995, the
        Company paid TCB the outstanding balance of $1,300,000 originally
        advanced to the Company during the quarter ended November 30, 1995,
        plus accrued interest. As of February 28, 1997, the Company has
        borrowed $0 against the available line of credit, and has $9.3 million
        available for advances under the revolving credit facility.

        The line of credit bears interest at (1) the lesser of the Floating
        Base Rate or the maximum nonusurious interest rate permitted by law
        and/or (2) the lesser of the LIBOR Rate plus LIBOR Margin or the
        maximum nonusurious interest rate permitted by law.

        Floating Base Rate means the greater of (i) TCB's prime rate of
        interest or (ii) the weighted average of the rates on overnight federal
        funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System arranged
        by federal funds brokers plus one-half of one percent (.5%). LIBOR Rate
        means the quotient of (i) the Interbank Offered Rate divided by (ii)
        the remainder of 1.0 minus the LIBOR reserve requirement. LIBOR Margin
        is 1.25% to 1.75% depending on the debt coverage ratio.

        The original maturity date of this line of credit is December 15, 1998;
        however, it may be extended to December 15, 2000 if certain debt
        coverage ratios are met.

     5. STOCK OPTIONS

        In accordance with Horizon's 1989 and 1995 Stock Option Plans, there
        are 1,931,843 shares of common stock reserved for grant to key
        employees. Of which, 256,016 were granted and previously exercised as
        of August 31, 1996. In addition, 1,411,268 options and 1,461,327
        options were issued and outstanding at August 31, 1995 and 1996,
        respectively. During fiscal 1995 nonstatutory stock options to purchase
        168,000 shares of common stock were granted with an exercise price of
        $4.00, $6.6667, $7.4167 or $8.7833 per share, respectively. On
        September 1, 1995, the Company granted an additional 127,500 options
        under the 1995 Stock Option Plan at $9.75 per share subject to
        shareholder approval which was received on January 11, 1996. An
        additional 128,250 shares with an exercise price of $14.1667 were
        granted on August 15, 1996. An additional 4,500 shares with an exercise
        price of $16.3333 were granted during the first six months of fiscal
        year 1997. Management believes the exercise prices of the options
        approximated or exceeded the market value of the common stock at the
        date of grant. As such, no expense is recognized in the accompanying
        statements of income as a result of such issuance. The options are
        generally exercisable in cumulative installments over a four-year
        period and terminate 10 years from the date of grant. During fiscal
        1995 and 1996, 39,000 and 11,250 options granted to former officers
        were canceled respectively. An additional 27,937 options were canceled
        during the first six months of fiscal year 1997. During fiscal 1995,
        vested options of 101,250 and 17,325 have been exercised by certain
        officers at exercise prices of $0.8333 and $2.1417, respectively.
        During fiscal 1996, vested options of 42,000 at $0.50, and 38,816 at

-12-

    13

$0.8333 and 53,625 at $1.00 have been exercised by certain key
        employees. During fiscal 1997, vested options of 22,500 at $1.00 and
        18,750 at $3.6157 and 3,750 at $4.00 and 750 at $6.6667, and 42,485 at
        $0.8333 have been exercised by certain key employees.

        At February 28, 1997 there were 1,931,843 shares reserved, of which
        344,250 shares were issued and exercised, 1,349,656 shares were issued
        and unexercised and 237,937 shares remain unissued. Of the 1,349,656
        shares issued and unexercised, 539,589 shares were exercisable.

        On April 28, 1995 the board of directors created a stock option plan
        for outside directors owning less than 5% of the stock of the Company.
        150,000 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under this
        plan. This plan has been amended and restated to also provide for 3,000
        option grants to each eligible director each time they are re-elected
        to the board after having served as a director for at least one year
        since their initial grant under the plan. At February 28, 1997 there
        were 150,000 shares reserved under this plan, of which no shares were
        issued and exercised, 72,000 shares were issued and unexercised and
        78,000 shares remain unissued. Of the 72,000 shares issued and
        unexercised, 12,000 shares were exercisable. 12,000 options were issued
        to outside directors during the first six months of fiscal year 1997
        due to re-election at the January 29, 1997 Annual Meeting of
        Stockholders.

        On April 1, 1996 the Company filed an S-8 registration statement which
        registered 2,054,549 shares granted to or eligible for granting to
        employees and directors under the 1989 and 1995 Stock Option Plans, as
        amended, and the outside director stock option plan. This registration
        includes a separate reoffer prospectus to allow any shares issued in
        the future and most previously exercised shares under the 1989 and 1995
        Stock Option Plans to be traded at any time without any holding period
        or volume restrictions.

     6. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

        The Company recorded federal and state income taxes for the three and
        six months ended February 28, 1997, in the amount of $1,178,000 and
        $2,368,000, respectively, resulting in a combined tax rate of 39.3% and
        39.5%, respectively. For each period, the Company has reflected the
        benefit from utilization of available net operating loss carryforwards
        through a change in deferred taxes rather than a benefit to income tax
        expense.

     7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

        Horizon leases various office facilities and equipment under operating
        leases. In addition, Horizon leases space for one partial
        hospitalization program in association with one management contract.
        The following is a schedule, as of February 28, 1997, of minimum rental
        payments under these leases which expire at various dates:

-13-

    14

On December 20, 1995 the Company entered into a lease agreement with a
        term of approximately five years for a building to be constructed in
        Lewisville, Texas to the Company's specifications. On September 27,
        1996, a certificate of occupancy was issued and the Company occupied
        the building as its executive offices and National Support Center.
        Rental payments commenced the same date. In connection with the lease
        transaction, the Company has guaranteed a loan of approximately
        $900,000. The loan was by a financial institution to the building
        owner. The Company also agreed to purchase the leased building for
        approximately $4.5 million at the end of the lease term if it is not
        sold to a third party, or the Company does not extend its lease.

        On July 31, 1996, Horizon acquired eighty percent (80%) of the
        outstanding common stock of Florida Professional Psychological
        Services, Inc. ("PPS"). The purchase price is based primarily on a
        multiple of the 1996 pre-tax income of PPS. Horizon currently estimates
        the purchase price will be between $2,225,000 and $2,900,000, of which
        $1,225,000 was paid on July 31, 1996. Horizon expects to pay an interim
        amount of $1,000,000 on or about March 31, 1997. The final
        reconciliation statement of income of PPS for the twelve months ended
        December 31, 1996 is to be delivered on or before July 15, 1997, and
        any remaining purchase price is to be paid within 30 days after
        determination thereof.

        In connection with its purchase of the capital stock of Geriatric, the
        Company agreed to pay an additional $270,000 to the sellers in the
        event a qualifying management contract is signed on or before August 
        17, 1997.

        The remaining $500,000 of the purchase price payable by the Company for
        the capital stock of CCI, subject to reduction under certain
        circumstances specified in the stock purchase agreement, is due on or
        before ninety (90) days after March 15, 1997.

        Horizon is insured for professional and general liability on a
        claims-made policy, with additional tail coverage being obtained when
        necessary. Management is unaware of any claims against the Company that
        would cause the final expenses for professional and general liability
        to vary materially from amounts provided.

        Horizon is involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of
        business, including matters involving professional liability. It is the
        opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of such litigation
        would not be in excess of any reserves or have a material adverse
        effect on Horizon's financial position or results of operations.

     8. COMMON STOCK

        The Board of Directors of the Company approved a three-for-two stock
        split effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend, pursuant to which
        one additional share of Common Stock of the Company was issued on
        January 31, 1997 for every two shares of Common Stock held by
        stockholders of record at the close of business on January 22, 1997. As
        a result of such stock split/dividend, a total of $18,253 originally
        recorded as additional paid in capital was reclassified as common
        stock. Such stock split/dividend has been retroactively reflected in
        the consolidated financial statements included in this report. Upon
        effecting the stock split/dividend, the stock options and their related
        exercise prices were adjusted proportionately.

        In February 1997, the Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, of the
        Company was amended to increase the number of authorized shares of
        Common Stock, $.01 par value per share, of the Company from 10,000,000
        shares to 40,000,000 shares.

-14-

    15

In February 1997, the Company entered into a Rights Agreement pursuant
        to which it approved the distribution of one Common Stock purchase
        right for each outstanding share of Common Stock of the Company. The
        Rights Agreement and the amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation
        referred to above  were approved by the stockholders of the Company at
        the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on January 29, 1997.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

       The Company was formed in July 1989 for the purpose of acquiring all the
assets of two companies. One company, known as Horizon Health Management
Company, had been formed in 1981 and since that time had been engaged in the
mental health contract management business. The other company owned and
operated a freestanding psychiatric hospital in California. Although Horizon
owned, leased or managed a few freestanding psychiatric or substance abuse
facilities beginning March 1, 1990, the mental health contract management
business formed by Horizon's predecessor in 1981 has been Horizon's primary
business since subleasing its last remaining freestanding psychiatric hospital
on July 31, 1994.

       Effective August 1, 1994, Horizon and MHM formed the Horizon LLC.
Horizon signed a contract with the Horizon LLC to have it manage all of
Horizon's then existing management contracts for a 72.5% interest. Prior to
March 20, 1995, the remaining 27.5% interest in the Horizon LLC was held by MHM
which signed a contract with the Horizon LLC to have it manage all of MHM's
then existing 39 management contracts. Upon completion of its initial public
offering of common stock, Horizon became contractually obligated to acquire the
minority interest of MHM in the Horizon LLC. March 13, 1995 was the effective
date of the initial public offering. The acquisition of the minority interest
of MHM was effective March 20, 1995. As such, the Horizon LLC became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Horizon. The Horizon LLC was consolidated with the
Company effective March 1, 1995. Effective September 1, 1995, the Horizon LLC
was dissolved and its operations combined with Horizon's.

       Mental Health Outcomes, Inc. ("MHO, Inc."), a Delaware corporation, was
formed on August 10, 1995 and is engaged in the design and operation of outcome
measurement systems for psychiatric and chemical dependency providers. MHO,
Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Horizon.

       On July 31, 1996, Horizon acquired eighty percent (80%) of the
outstanding common stock of Florida Professional Psychological Services, Inc.,
also known as Professional Psychological Services, Inc. ("PPS"). PPS has been
consolidated with Horizon as of August 1, 1996. Horizon accounted for the
acquisition of PPS by the purchase method as required by generally accepted
accounting principles. Based in Clearwater, Florida, PPS specializes in full
risk, capitated managed behavioral health programs and employee assistance
programs. The purchase price is based primarily on a multiple of the 1996
pre-tax income of PPS. Horizon currently estimates the purchase price will be
between $2,225,000 and $2,900,000, of which $1,225,000 was paid on July 31,
1996. Horizon expects to pay an interim amount of $1,000,000 on or about March
31, 1997. The final reconciliation statement of income of PPS for the twelve
months ended December 31, 1996 is to be delivered on or before July 15, 1997,
and any remaining purchase price is to be paid within 30 days after
determination thereof. In addition, Horizon also obtained an option to acquire
the remaining twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding PPS common stock at a
future date. The sellers, constituting all the shareholders of PPS, also
obtained the right to put to Horizon such shares on certain dates. The option
and put prices for the remaining PPS shares are based on a multiple of the
pre-tax income of PPS in future years.

    17

Effective March 15, 1997, the Company purchased all of the outstanding
capital stock of Geriatric Medical Care, Inc., a Tennessee corporation
("Geriatric"). Geriatric is a contract manager of mental health services for
acute care hospitals. Geriatric had total revenues of approximately $5.7
million in 1996 and currently has 17 management contract locations, of which
two are not yet in operation at the date of this report. The cash purchase
price of approximately $4.3 million, which was paid at closing from existing
cash of the Company, included retiring essentially all of Geriatric's
outstanding debt. In connection with the stock purchase, the Company also
agreed to pay an additional $270,000 to the sellers in the event a qualifying 
management contract is signed on or before August 17, 1997.

       Effective March 15, 1997, the Company purchased all of the outstanding
capital stock of Clay Care, Inc., a Texas corporation ("CCI"). CCI is a
contract manager of mental health services for acute care hospitals. CCI
currently has management contracts with five hospitals of which four are in
operation and one is scheduled to open in April 1997. CCI had total revenues of
approximately $1.3 million in 1996. A total of $475,000 of the $975,000 cash
purchase price was paid at the closing from existing cash of the Company. The
remaining $500,000 of the total purchase price, which the Company also expects
to pay from available cash, is due ninety (90) days from the closing date,
subject to reduction under certain circumstances specified in the stock
purchase agreement.

       Horizon, which had previously traded on the American Stock Exchange
under the symbol "HMH", began trading on the Nasdaq National Market on May 7,
1996, under the symbol "HMHM".

       At February 28, 1997, the Company had management contracts with 119
general acute care hospitals located in 36 states, providing for the operation
of a total of 195 various treatment programs.

SUMMARY STATISTICAL DATA

*     Reflects the assumption by the Horizon LLC of management responsibility
      under the 39 MHM contracts effective August 1, 1994, of which 37
      contracts had commenced operations at that date.

(A)   Beginning with the quarter ended February 29, 1996 a new methodology
      which redefined the statistical definition of an operating service or
      program was implemented. To avoid duplicity, multiple services/treatment
      programs within each category at one location are now being reported as a
      single service/treatment program where the predominant treatment defines
      the appropriate categories. As a result of this reporting change, prior
      periods have been restated as estimates based on the new reporting
      definition.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
       THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 1996 AND FEBRUARY 28, 1997

The following table sets forth for the three month and six month periods ended
February 29, 1996 and February 28, 1997, the percentage relationship to total
net revenues of certain costs, expenses and income.

    20

THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 1997 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED 
 FEBRUARY 29, 1996

         Net Revenues. Net revenues for the three months ended February 28,
1997 were $18.5 million, representing an increase of $3.4 million, or 22.5%, as
compared to net revenues of $15.1 million for the corresponding period in the
prior fiscal year. In part, this increase resulted from an increase in the 
average number of contract locations in operation from 101.6 for the three
months ended February 29, 1996, to 109.5 for the three months ended February
28, 1997, an increase of 7.8%. In addition, revenues increased $1.3 million, or
8.6%, due to revenue recorded for Florida Professional Psychological Services,
Inc. ("PPS"). Horizon acquired 80% of the outstanding common stock of PPS on
July 31, 1996, and consolidated PPS with Horizon as of August 1, 1996. Revenues
increased $1.1 million, or 7.3%, at locations that have been under Horizon
management during all periods being reported. This was primarily the result of
an average rate increase of 2.5% and the addition of new programs including a
41.0% increase in CQI Plus fees, a 283% increase in Home Health fees and a 97%
increase in Outpatient fees between the periods.

         Salaries and Benefits. Salaries and benefits for the three months
ended February 28, 1997 were $10.0 million, representing an increase of $1.6
million, or 19.0%, as compared to salaries and benefits of $8.4 million for the
three months ended February 29, 1996. This increase resulted from the increase
in full time equivalents from 606.0 for the three months ended February 29,
1996, to 689.0 for the three months ended February 28, 1997, an increase of
13.7%.
Full time equivalents increased between the periods as follows:

The increase in the National Support Center full time equivalents of
16.2% results from the expansion of the General and Administrative Department,
as well as the expansion of Mental Health Outcomes, Inc. The increase in
contract location full time equivalents of 5.8% results from an increase in the
average number of contract locations in operation from 101.6 for the three
months ended February 29, 1996, to 109.5 for the three months ended February
28, 1997, an increase of 7.8%. Additionally, Horizon acquired eighty percent
(80%) of the outstanding common stock of PPS on July 31, 1996. PPS's FTE's
averaged 47.6, with associated salary of $474,000, for the quarter ended
February 28, 1997. The Company's average annualized salaries per full time
equivalent for the three months ended February 28, 1997 were $50,015
representing an increase of $3,005, or 6.4%, as compared to average annualized
salaries per full time equivalent of $47,010 for the three months ended
February 29, 1996. Benefits for the three months ended February 28, 1997 were
$1.4 million, representing an increase of $100,000, or 7.7%, as compared to
benefits of $1.3 million for the three months ended February 29, 1996. This
increase resulted primarily from an increase of $77,000 between the periods in
relation to the acquisition of PPS on July 31, 1996.

         Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses
for the three months ended February 28, 1997 were $367,000, representing an
increase of $43,000, or 13.3%, as compared to depreciation and amortization
expenses of $324,000 for the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year.
$11,000 of this increase is due to the amortization of goodwill of $1.8 million
resulting from the acquisition of Florida Professional Psychological Services,
Inc. The remainder of this increase results from the depreciation expense of
additional equipment purchased for the operation of its contract management
business.

-20-

    21

Other Operating Expenses (Including Purchased Services and Provision
for Bad Debts). Other operating expenses for the three months ended February
28, 1997, were $5.2 million, representing an increase of $1.0 million, or
23.8%, as compared to other operating expenses of $4.2 million for the
corresponding period in the prior fiscal year. The following components 
identify the variances between the periods reported.

         Purchased services included a $88,000 decrease in Medical Directors'
administrative fees for the three months ended February 28, 1997 as compared to
the same period in the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of certain
physician contracts having been renegotiated resulting in a general lowering of
compensatory fees. In addition, an increase occurred in purchased services due
to an increase of $389,000 in direct service fees related to PPS, which was
acquired by the Company on July 31, 1996. Consulting expense increased $188,000
for the three months ended February 28, 1997 as compared to the three months
ended February 29, 1996. $74,000 of this increase is related to a software
upgrade for the regional offices and the National Support Center, and $47,000
is related to fees for a marketing survey.

         Bad debt expense was $278,000 for the three months ended February 28,
1997 as compared to no bad debt expense for the three months ended February 29,
1996. This increase was primarily due to the non-timely payment by contracted
hospitals.

         $63,000 of the increase in other operating expenses was due to rent
expense related to PPS, which was acquired by the Company on July 31, 1996.

         Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net. Interest income, net of
interest expense, and other income for the three months ended February 28, 1997
was $161,000, as compared to $67,000 in net interest income for the
corresponding period in the prior fiscal year. This change results primarily
from an increase in interest income of $89,000 due to the increase in cash from
$1.8 million to $8.7 million, when compared to the same period in the prior
fiscal year.

         Income Tax Expense. For the three month period ended February 28,
1997, the Company recorded federal and state income taxes of $1,178,000
resulting in a combined tax rate of 39.3%. For the three month period ended
February 29, 1996, the Company recorded federal and state income taxes of
$891,000 resulting in a combined tax rate of 40.0%. For each period, the
benefit from utilization of available net operating loss carryforwards was
reflected through a change in deferred taxes rather than a benefit to income
tax expense.

-21-

    22

SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 1997 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 
    FEBRUARY 29, 1996

         Net Revenues. Net revenues for the six months ended February 28, 1997
were $37.4 million, representing an increase of $7.7 million, or 25.9%, as
compared to net revenues of $29.7 million for the corresponding period in the
prior fiscal year. In part, this increase resulted from an increase in the 
average number of contract locations in operation from 101.8 for the six months
ended February 29, 1996, to 108.5 for the six months ended February 28, 1997,
an increase of 6.6%. In addition, revenues increased $2.5 million, or 8.6%, due
to revenue recorded for Florida Professional Psychological Services, Inc.
("PPS"). Horizon acquired 80% of the outstanding common stock of PPS on July
31, 1996, and consolidated PPS with Horizon as of August 1, 1996. Revenues
increased $700,000, or 2.5%, due to a cost report adjustment for Mountain Crest
recorded in November 1996. In addition, revenues increased $2.6 million, or
8.9%, at locations that have been under Horizon management during all periods
being reported. This was primarily the result of an average rate increase of
2.6% and the addition of new programs including a 331% increase in Home Health
fees and a 54% increase in Outpatient fees between the periods.

         Salaries and Benefits. Salaries and benefits for the six months ended
February 28, 1997 were $20.1 million, representing an increase of $3.7 million,
or 22.6%, as compared to salaries and benefits of $16.4 million for the six
months ended February 29, 1996. This increase resulted from the increase in
full time equivalents from 595.4 for the six months ended February 29, 1996, to
685.2 for the six months ended February 28, 1997, an increase of 15.1%. Full
time equivalents increased between the periods as follows:

The increase in the National Support Center full time equivalents of
17.2% results from the expansion of the General and Administrative Department,
as well as the expansion of Mental Health Outcomes, Inc. The increase in
contract location full time equivalents of 7.2% results from an increase in the
average number of contract locations in operation from 101.8 for the six months
ended February 29, 1996, to 108.5 for the six months ended February 28, 1997,
an increase of 6.6%. Additionally, Horizon acquired eighty percent (80%) of the
outstanding common stock of PPS on July 31, 1996. PPS's FTE's averaged 46.6,
with associated salary of $954,000, for the six months ended February 28, 1997.
The Company's average annualized salaries per full time equivalent for the six
months ended February 28, 1997 were $50,105 representing an increase of $2,712,
or 5.7%, as compared to average annualized salaries per full time equivalent of
$47,393 for the six months ended February 29, 1996. Benefits for the six months
ended February 28, 1997 were $3.0 million, representing an increase of
$700,000, or 30.4%, as compared to benefits of $2.3 million for the six months
ended February 29, 1996. This increase resulted primarily from an increase of
$308,000 in medical insurance premiums and employer payroll taxes paid between
the periods. In addition, benefits also increased due to an increase in the
amount accrued for the Company's 401K match from $104,000 for the six months
ended February 29, 1996, to $368,000 for the six months ended February 28,
1997, representing an increase of $264,000, or 254%. This is primarily
attributable to a retroactive increase to January 1, 1996, of the Company's
401K match as a result of an additional accrual of the potential employer match
totaling $237,000 based on employee 401K contributions for calendar 1996.
Benefits also increased $128,000 between the periods in relation to the
acquisition of PPS on July 31, 1996.

                                      -22-

    23

Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses
for the six months ended February 28, 1997 were $799,000, representing an
increase of $157,000, or 24.5%, as compared to depreciation and amortization
expenses of $642,000 for the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year.
$22,000 of this increase is due to the amortization of goodwill of $1.8 million
resulting from the acquisition of Florida Professional Psychological Services,
Inc. In addition, the Company recorded $73,000 of additional depreciation
expense due to a change in the Company's definition of a capital expenditure.
The remainder of this increase results from the depreciation expense of
additional equipment purchased for the operation of its contract management
business. Cash expenditures used for the purchase of property and equipment
were $928,000 for the six months ended February 28, 1997, an increase of
$636,000, as compared to $292,000 for the six months ended February 29, 1996.

         Other Operating Expenses (Including Purchased Services and Provision
for Bad Debts). Other operating expenses for the six months ended February 28,
1997, were $10.7 million, representing an increase of $2.2 million or 25.9%, as
compared to other operating expenses of $8.5 million for the corresponding
period in the prior fiscal year.
The following components identify the variances between the periods reported.

         Purchased services included a $223,000 decrease in Medical Directors'
administrative fees for the six months ended February 28, 1997 as compared to
the same period in the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of successful
contract negotiations with physicians on a permanent basis to provide
administrative services which minimized the usage of Locum Tenens Physicians
(i.e., contracting with physicians/physician placement services to provide
qualified individuals to perform administrative duties on a temporary basis).
Additionally, certain physician contracts have been renegotiated resulting in a
general lowering of compensatory fees. In addition, an increase occurred in
purchased services due to an increase of $815,000 in direct service fees
related to PPS, which was acquired by the Company on July 31, 1996. Consulting
expense increased $120,000 for the six months ended February 28, 1997 as
compared to the six months ended February 29, 1996. $74,000 of this increase is
related to a software upgrade for the regional offices and the National Support
Center, and $47,000 is related to fees for a marketing survey.

         Bad debt expense increased $462,000 for the six months ended February
28, 1997 as compared to the six months ended February 29, 1996. This increase
was primarily due to the non-timely payment by contracted hospitals.

         Other operating expenses increased due to an increase of $238,000 in
telephone and rent expense for the six months ended February 28, 1997 as
compared to the six months ended February 29, 1996. $127,000 of this increase
is related to rent for PPS, which was acquired by the Company on July 31, 1996.
The remaining amount is primarily related to the increased capabilities of the
telephone systems installed in both the regional offices and the newly expanded
National Support Center, which includes the use of video teleconferencing in
each of these locations. The newly expanded National Support Center and the
addition of two outpatient practices resulted in the increase in rent expense.
Other operating expenses experienced an increase of $172,000 due to an increase
in legal settlements for the six months ended February 28, 1997, as compared to
the corresponding six months of the prior year. Additionally, other operating
expenses increased due to $380,000 in contract capital contributions (facility
renovations) for the six months ended February 28, 1997, as compared to no
contract capital contributions for the six months ended February 29, 1996.

         Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net. Interest income, net of
interest expense, and other income for the six months ended February 28, 1997
was $301,000, as compared to $110,000 in net interest income for the
corresponding period in the prior fiscal year. This change results primarily
from a decrease in interest expense of $24,000 resulting from the retirement of
long-term debt on October 3, 1995 and an increase in interest income of
$165,000 due to the increase in cash from $1.8 million to $8.7 million, when
compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.

-23-

    24

Income Tax Expense. For the six month period ended February 28, 1997,
the Company recorded federal and state income taxes of $2,368,000 resulting in
a combined tax rate of 39.5%. For the six month period ended February 29, 1996,
the Company recorded federal and state income taxes of $1,687,000 resulting in
a combined tax rate of 39.5%. For each period, the benefit from utilization of
available net operating loss carryforwards was reflected through a change in
deferred taxes rather than a benefit to income tax expense.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Effective September 29, 1995, the Company completed a transaction with
Texas Commerce Bank, N.A. for an $11 million revolving credit facility. The
purpose of the facility is to provide funds to be used for working capital
needs and future acquisitions. The facility is for a three year term with
extension provisions. As of February 28, 1997, the Company had $9.3 million
available under the revolving credit facility, of which the Company had
borrowed $0 as of February 28, 1997. Under the terms of the facility, the
principal outstanding thereunder to the Company from time to time cannot exceed
the lesser of (i) $11.0 million and (ii) the sum of 80% of the Company's
consolidated eligible accounts receivable, as defined, plus additional amounts
up to $3,372,450 based on specified time periods and the Company's debt
coverage ratio, as defined, less certain reserves. Principal outstanding under
the facility will bear interest at a "Floating Base Rate" and/or the "LIBOR
Rate plus Applicable LIBOR Margin", as selected by the Company in accordance
with the terms of the facility. See Note 4 to the Company's Consolidated
Financial Statements included herein. Accrued interest will be payable monthly
during the primary term of the facility, and quarterly thereafter if the term
of the facility is extended. Depending upon the Company's debt coverage ratio
at December 15, 1998, principal borrowed under the facility will either be due
in full on such date, or a portion of such principal will be due on such date,
and the remainder will be due in eight equal quarterly installments thereafter
ending December 15, 2000.

         The Company is subject to certain covenants under the agreements
governing the credit facility, including prohibitions against (i) incurring
additional debt or liens, except permitted debt (defined to include purchase
money debt of $1.0 million in the aggregate) or specified permitted liens, (ii)
certain material acquisitions, other than permitted acquisitions as defined
(including acquisitions not exceeding $7.0 million per transaction), (iii)
certain mergers, consolidations, or asset dispositions by the Company, or
changes of control of the Company, (iv) certain management vacancies at the
Company, and (v) entering into any lines of business other than that in which
the Company is presently engaged. In addition, the terms of the facility
require the Company to satisfy certain ongoing financial covenants. The
facility is secured by all of the capital stock of the subsidiaries of the
Company and substantially all other assets of the Company.

         The Company has agreed to purchase a leased building for approximately
$4.5 million at the end of the lease term if it is not sold to a third party,
or the Company does not extend its lease. (See Note 7 to the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements included herein).

         On July 31, 1996, Horizon acquired eighty percent (80%) of the
outstanding common stock of Florida Professional Psychological Services, Inc.
("PPS"). The purchase price is based primarily on a multiple of the 1996
pre-tax income of PPS. Horizon currently estimates the purchase price will be
between $2,225,000 and $2,900,000, of which $1,225,000 was paid on July 31,
1996. Horizon expects to pay an interim amount of $1,000,000 on or about March
31, 1997. The final reconciliation statement of income of PPS for the twelve
months ended December 31, 1996 is to be delivered on or before July 15, 1997,
and any remaining purchase price is to be paid within 30 days after
determination thereof.

         Effective March 15, 1997, the Company purchased all of the outstanding
capital stock of Geriatric Medical Care, Inc., a Tennessee corporation
("Geriatric"). Geriatric is a contract manager of mental health services for
acute care hospitals. Geriatric had total revenues of approximately $5.7
million in 1996 and currently has 17 management contract locations, of which
two are not yet in operation at the date of this report. The cash purchase
price of approximately $4.3 million, which was paid at closing from existing
cash of the Company, included retiring essentially all of Geriatric's
outstanding debt. In connection with the stock purchase, the Company also
agreed to pay an additional $270,000 (which, if required, the Company also
expects to pay from its available cash) to the sellers in the event a 
qualifying management contract is signed on or before August 17, 1997.

-25-

    26

Effective March 15, 1997, the Company purchased all of the outstanding
capital stock of Clay Care, Inc., a Texas corporation ("CCI"). CCI is a
contract manager of mental health services for acute care hospitals. CCI
currently has management contracts with five hospitals of which four are in
operation and one is scheduled to open in April 1997. CCI had total revenues of
approximately $1.3 million in 1996. A total of $475,000 of the $975,000 cash
purchase price was paid at the closing from existing cash of the Company. The
remaining $500,000 of the total purchase price, which the Company also expects
to pay from available cash, is due ninety (90) days from the closing date,
subject to reduction under certain circumstances specified in the stock
purchase agreement.

         The Company believes that its net working capital of $9.2 million at
February 28, 1997 (including cash of $8.7 million at that date) and the $9.3
million available under the revolving credit facility at that date will be
sufficient to cover all cash requirements over the next twelve months including
estimated capital expenditures of $750,000. The Company generated approximately
$1.3 million in net cash from operations during the six months ended February
28, 1997.

         Statements contained herein and in various public presentations that
are based on future expectations rather than on historical facts are
forward-looking statements as defined under The Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any such
forward-looking statement include but are not limited to demand by general
hospitals for the Company's services, the Company's ability to retain existing
management contracts and to obtain additional contracts, changes in
reimbursement to general hospitals by Medicare or other third-party payors for
costs of providing mental health services, changes to other regulatory
provisions relating to mental health services, overall economic conditions and
various other risks as outlined in the Company's Securities and Exchange
Commission filings.

         (f)     The amount or amounts which shall be paid to the holders of
                 shares of such series in case of liquidation, dissolution or

                 involuntary, and the priority in which such payments shall be
                 made in relation to other series or classes of capital stock

         (g)     Whether or not the shares of such series shall be convertible
                 into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or
                 classes or of any other series of the same or any other class
                 of capital stock of the Corporation and, if convertible or
                 exchangeable, the conversion price or prices or rate or rates
                 of conversion or exchange and such other terms and conditions
                 of conversion or exchange as shall be stated in said
                 resolution or resolutions;

         (h)     The terms, conditions and amounts of any obligations of the
                 Corporation to repurchase the shares of such series, subject
                 to any applicable limitations imposed by law; and

         (i)     Such other designations, powers, preferences, rights,
                 qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof as it may
                 deem advisable, as permitted by law, and as shall be stated in
                 said resolution or resolutions.

         (j)     The shares of each class or series of the Preferred Stock may
                 vary from the shares of any other class or series thereof in
                 any or all of the foregoing respects.  The board of directors
                 of the Corporation may increase the number of shares of the
                 Preferred Stock designated for any existing class or series by
                 a resolution adding to such class or series authorized and
                 unissued shares of the Preferred Stock not designated for any
                 other class or series.  The board of directors of the
                 Corporation may decrease the number of shares of the Preferred
                 Stock designated for any existing class or series by a
                 resolution subtracting from such class or series authorized
                 and unissued shares of the Preferred Stock designated for such
                 existing class or series, and the shares so subtracted shall
                 become authorized, unissued and undesignated shares of the
                 Preferred Stock.

         Except as otherwise required by law or by a resolution or resolutions
of the Board of Directors adopted pursuant to this Article IV, the holders of
the Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to vote at any meeting of
stockholders or otherwise to participate in any action taken by the Corporation
or its stockholders.

                 options shall be evidenced by instrument(s) approved by the
                 board of directors of the Corporation.  The board of directors
                 of the Corporation shall be empowered to set the exercise

         No contract or transaction between the Corporation and one or more of
its directors, officer, or shareholders or between the Corporation and any
person (as used herein "person" means other corporation, partnership,
association, firm, trust, joint venture, political subdivision, or
instrumentality) or other organization in which one or more of its directors,
officers, or shareholders are directors, officers, or shareholders or have a
financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely
because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of
the board or committee which authorizes the contract or

- 5 -
    6
transaction, or solely because his, her or their votes are counted for such
purpose, if: (i) the material facts as to his or her relationship or interest
and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the board
of directors or the committee, and the board of directors or the committee in
good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a
majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested
directors be less than a quorum; or (ii) the material facts as to his or her
relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or
are known to the shareholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or
transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the
shareholders); or (iii) the contract or transaction is fair as to the
Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified by the board
of directors, a committee thereof, or the shareholders.  Common or interested
directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting
of the board of directors or of a committee which authorizes the contract or
transaction.

                                  ARTICLE XII

         The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was, is, or is
threatened to be made a part to a proceeding (as hereinafter defined) by reason
of the fact that he or she (i) is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation or (ii) while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner,
venturer, proprietor, trustee, employee, agent, or similar functionary of
another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole
proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, to the
fullest extent permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the
same exists or may hereafter be amended.  Such right shall be a contract right
and as such shall run to the benefit of any director who is elected and accepts
the position of director of the Corporation or elects to continue to serve as a
director of the Corporation while this Article XII is in effect.  Any repeal or
amendment of this Article XII shall be prospective only and shall not limit the
rights of any such director or the obligations of the Corporation with respect
to any claim arising from or related to the services of such director in any of
the foregoing capacities prior to any such repeal or amendment to this Article
XII.  Such right shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation expenses
incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition
to the maximum extent permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law, as
the same exists or may hereafter be amended.  If a claim for indemnification or
advancement of expenses hereunder is not paid in full by the Corporation within
sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the
claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to
recover the unpaid amount of the claim, and if successful in whole or in part,
the claimant shall also be entitled to be paid the expenses of prosecuting such
claim.  It shall be a defense to any such action that such indemnification or
advancement of costs of defense are not permitted under the Delaware General
Corporation Law, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the
Corporation.  Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its board of
directors or any committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or shareholders)
to have made its determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification of, or advancement of costs of defense to, the claimant is
permissible in the circumstances nor an actual determination by the Corporation
(including its board of directors or any committee thereof, independent legal
counsel, or shareholders) that such indemnification or advancement is not
permissible shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that

- 6 -
    7
such indemnification or advancement is not permissible. ln the event of the
death of any person having a right of indemnification under the foregoing
provisions, such right shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs,
executors, administrators, and personal representatives.  The rights conferred
above shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or
hereafter acquire under any statute, bylaw, resolution of shareholders or
directors, agreement or otherwise.

         The Corporation may additionally indemnify any employee or agent of
the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law.

         As used herein, the term "proceeding" means any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
arbitrative or investigative, any appeal in such an action, suit or proceeding,
and any inquiry or investigation that could lease to such an action, suit or
proceeding.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

         The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal
any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now
or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders
herein are granted subject to such reservation.

                                  ARTICLE XIV

         The name and address of the incorporator is:

The undersigned, being the incorporator herein before named, for the
purpose of forming a corporation pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware, does make this Certificate hereby declaring and certifying
that this is my act and deed and the facts stated herein are true, and
accordingly I have hereunto set my hand this 6th day of July, 1989.

upon the Purchaser determining during the period commencing on the Effective
Date and continuing through and including twenty-one (21) days after the
Effective Date (the "Contract Review Period") that the management contracts
between the Company and hospitals for whom the Company is providing management
services (the "Management Contracts") are satisfactory to the Purchaser in its
sole discretion.  During such Contract Review Period, Purchaser shall make such
review of the Management Contracts and may make such contacts with the
hospitals which are parties to the Management Contracts as Purchaser deems
necessary or appropriate to confirm the terms of the Management Contracts, to
confirm that the Management Contracts are not in default, and to confirm such
other matters pertaining to the Management Contracts as Purchaser may deem
appropriate; provided, however, that Purchaser shall not contact any hospital
(in person or by telephone) concerning any Management Contracts or any other
matter relating to the Company's business relationship with any such hospital
unless a designated representative of the Company participates in any such
meeting or conversation.  Sellers and the Company covenant and agree that the
Company shall cooperate in good faith to make designated representatives
available for such purposes in order that Purchaser may complete such review of
all the Management Contracts within the Contract Review Period.

       At any time during the Contract Review Period, the Purchaser shall have
the right to terminate this Agreement by written notice to Sellers and to the
Company if Purchaser determines in its sole discretion that the Management
Contracts are not satisfactory to it.  If Purchaser fails to terminate this
Agreement on or before the expiration of the Contract Review Period, then
Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived such right of termination.  In the
event Purchaser terminates this Agreement under the terms of this Section 2.4,
then neither Sellers, Purchaser nor the Company shall have any further rights
or obligations under this Agreement of any kind whatsoever except solely for
the provisions of Sections 6.12, 7.4 and 7.6 which shall survive such
termination.

       2.5       Joinder of Other Shareholders.  Promptly after execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Purchaser shall offer to all other shareholders
of the Company the right to join as a party to this Agreement.  The Sellers and
the Company shall cooperate and assist Purchaser in communicating such offer to
the other shareholders.  Each other shareholder of the Company who elects to
join as a party to this Agreement shall be required to execute and deliver a
Signature Page and Joinder Agreement in the form of Exhibit B attached hereto.
Each

3
    10
shareholder of the Company that so joins as a party to this Agreement shall
become a "Seller" hereunder.

       2.6       Disputed Instruments.  The parties acknowledge that the
Purchase Price to be paid to the Sellers under this Agreement will be
determined based on a fully-converted basis assuming the exercise of all
outstanding warrants, options or rights to acquire capital stock of the Company
and the conversion of all outstanding securities convertible into capital stock
of the Company.  Set forth in Schedule 4.4 is a warrant held by Ramsay
Healthcare (the "Ramsay Warrant") and certain outstanding convertible notes of
the Company (the "Convertible Notes").  Schedule 4.4 also sets forth the
percentage amount of the total equity ownership of the Company on a
fully-converted basis which was attributed to the Ramsay Warrant and the
Convertible Notes for the purposes of calculating the Purchase Price payable to
the Sellers under this Agreement.

       Sellers and the Company contend that:

                 (a)      The Ramsay Warrant is subject to an obligation of
Ramsay to comply with the terms of that certain agreement, dated August 22,
1994, between Ramsay and the Company, as amended by amendment dated January 26,
1996, which contemplates the continuation of two certain management agreements
through the expiration of their respective initial terms and it is the position
of the Company that the failure of Ramsay to satisfy such contractual
obligation will cause the Ramsay Warrant to be void and of no effect; and

                 (b)      It is the position of the Company that certain of the
holders of the Convertible Notes have waived their right to convert their
respective Convertible Notes into capital stock of the Company by electing
certain accelerated prepayments of the Convertible Notes.

       Purchaser shall have the right to calculate the Purchase Price payable
to the Sellers taking into account the equity ownership of the Company on a
fully-converted basis represented by the Ramsay Warrant and the Convertible
Notes and the total equity ownership of each Seller reflected in Exhibit A has
been calculated on such fully-converted basis.  However, in the event that the
Convertible Notes are paid in full and not converted or there is a final and
binding determination by agreement of the parties or by a court of competent
jurisdiction that some or all of such Convertible Notes are not convertible,
then Purchaser shall promptly pay to Sellers that amount of the Purchase Price
which otherwise would have been payable to Sellers if the Convertible Notes had
not been outstanding on the date of Closing.

       In the event that there is a final and binding determination by
agreement of the parties or by a court of competent jurisdiction within one (1)
year from the date of the Closing (or such later date as a final order may be
entered in the event litigation concerning such matter is pending at the end of
such year) that the Ramsay Warrant is void and of no effect, then the Purchaser
shall promptly pay to the Sellers that amount of the Purchase Price which
otherwise would have been payable to the Sellers if the Ramsay Warrant had not
been outstanding on the date of the Closing.  If there has been no final and
binding determination that the Ramsay

4
    11
Warrant is void and of no effect within one (1) year (or such later date as a
final order may be entered in the event litigation concerning such matter is
pending at the end of such year), then the Purchaser shall have no obligation
to the Sellers of any kind whatsoever.

       It is expressly understood that in the event the holders of the
Convertible Notes convert such Convertible Notes at or prior to the Closing or
the holder of the Ramsay Warrant exercises such Ramsay Warrant at or prior to
the Closing, then such holders may join as a party to their Agreement by the
execution and delivery of the Signature Page and Joinder Agreement as
contemplated by Section 2.5 above.

       The Sellers shall have the right, at their own expense, to bring an
action to resolve the validity of the Ramsay Warrant and the convertibility of
the Convertible Notes described above.  In the event that the Ramsay contracts
are terminated early by Ramsay, then Purchaser shall have the right to bring an
action to declare the Ramsay Warrant void and of no effect if the Sellers
decline to do so.  In such event, if the Ramsay Warrant is declared void in
such proceeding, then the amount payable to the Sellers shall be reduced by the
aggregate amount of the costs and expenses of Purchaser in prosecuting such
declaratory judgment action.  In the event that the Ramsay Warrant is not
declared void in such proceeding, the Purchaser shall be paid the aggregate
amount of such costs and expenses out of the post-closing escrow account
described in Section 10.4 of this Agreement.

past practice which, in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect
on the condition (financial or otherwise), assets or business of the Company.

excess of $10,000 and each person to whom the aggregate amount of liabilities

effective and continuing leasehold rights in the case of leased property, to

such a manner as to create the appearance or reasonable expectation that the
same is owned or leased by it, free and clear of all liens, security interests,
restrictions, claims, encumbrances, and charges of any kind whatsoever.  The
Sellers do not know of any potential action or assertion of rights, including
condemnation, by any party, governmental or other, and no proceedings with
respect thereto have been instituted of which any Seller or the Company has
notice, that would materially affect the ability of the Company to utilize each
of such assets in its business.  The Company has not received any notices of
default or other violations from any landlord regarding any properties leased
by the Company.  Schedule 4.9 hereto contains a detailed listing of all
material assets of the Company.  The assets now owned by the Company constitute
all assets reasonably necessary to enable Purchaser to conduct the business and
operations of the Company on substantially the same terms as such business has
been conducted historically and is being conducted on the Effective Date.
Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, no other representations or
warranties have been made by Sellers or the Company as to the condition or
suitability for any particular purpose of the assets of the Company.  To the
knowledge of the Sellers, none of the assets owned, leased or used by the
Company in the operation of its business materially violates or fails to comply
in any material respect with any applicable federal, state or local health,

regulations and the Company has not received any notice of an alleged violation
thereof.

any governmental entity indicated to the Company an intention to conduct the
same; and (ii) there is no action, suit, or administrative, condemnation,

or other governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency, or
instrumentality.  The Company is not now, and has not been, a party to any

business or the marketing of any of its products or services.

property to which the Company is a party (the "Real Property Leases").
Accurate and complete copies of the Real Property Leases, as amended to the
Effective Date, have been delivered to Purchaser.  Except as disclosed on
Schedule 4.11, neither the Sellers nor the Company has received any notices
that the land, buildings, facilities and other structures and improvements
subject to the Real Property Leases are not in compliance with any applicable
zoning, environmental or health laws and regulations or any other similar law,
statute, regulation or ordinance.  The Company is the lessee and in peaceful
and undisturbed possession of the property subject to the Real Property Leases.

the Company relating to any of premises subject to the Real Property Leases.
There is no pending proceeding or governmental action, and the Sellers have not
received notice of any threatened proceeding or governmental action, to condemn
or take by the power of eminent domain (or to purchase in lieu thereof) all or
any part of the property subject to the Real Property Leases which is material
to the operations of the Company as presently conducted.  The Company does not
own any real property.

       4.12      Intellectual Property.  Schedule 4.12 is an accurate and
complete list of all copyrights, trade names that the Company uses in its
business operations.  Except as disclosed on Schedule 4.12 the Company has no

litigation or claim of infringement.  Except for the license to use the
trademark owned by The Center for Health & Creative Aging, P.C. set forth in

the Company have not been examined or audited by the Service.  Except as set
forth on Schedule 4.23, no material issues have been raised in any examination

result in a proposed adjustment to the liability of the Company for taxes for
any other period not so examined.

Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") concerning collapsible

property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the
Code during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the

positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial understatement of

contract, or otherwise.  The Company has not agreed, nor is it required to
make, any adjustment under Code Section 481(a) by reason of a change in
accounting method or otherwise.

the proper taxing authorities all withholding amounts and taxes required to be
withheld or paid for all income, unemployment, social security, medicare or
other similar Taxes, programs or benefits with respect to wages, salary and
other compensation of directors, officers and employees of the Company.

       The Company has at all times of its existence been taxed as a "C
Corporation" and at no time has elected to be taxed, or filed tax returns as an
"S Corporation," as such terms are commonly used under the Code.

       4.24      Transactions With Affiliates.  Except as set forth in Schedule
4.24, there are no loans, leases, agreements, contracts or other transactions
between the Company and any present or former stockholder, director or officer
of the Company, or any member of such stockholder's, director's or officer's
immediate family.  Except as set forth in Schedule 4.24, no stockholder,
director or officer of the Company nor any of their respective spouses or
family members owns directly or indirectly on an individual or joint basis any
material interest in, or serves as an officer or director of, or in any similar
capacity for, any competitor, customer, provider or supplier of the Company or
any organization which has a material contract or arrangement with the Company.

       4.25      Improper Payments.  To the knowledge of the Sellers, neither
the Company, nor any shareholder, director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company has made any improper bribes, kickbacks or other payments on behalf of

that it can bear the economic risk in connection with its purchase of the
Shares and that it can afford to suffer the complete loss of its investment in
the Shares.

written news releases, pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby shall be submitted to Purchaser for review and approval
prior to the release by the Company, and shall be released only in a form
approved by Purchaser, provided, however, that (i) such approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld and (ii) such review and approval shall not be required
of statements and announcements if prior review and approval would prevent the
timely and accurate dissemination of such statements and announcements as
required to comply, in the judgement of counsel, with any applicable
governmental law, rule or regulation.  Sellers and Purchaser shall issue a
press release regarding the execution of this Agreement within one day of the
date hereof or such other time as Sellers and Purchaser may mutually agree.

the Company will, deliver as soon as reasonably practicable to Purchaser
unaudited financial statements of the

22
    29

financial statements become available in the usual course of business.

       6.8       Expenses.  All fees and expenses of Counsel to Sellers and all
other advisors or financial consultants to the Sellers or engaged by the
Company on behalf of the Sellers incurred in connection with this Agreement and

Payment of any such fees or expenses of the Sellers paid or incurred by the
Company will be paid at Closing by the Sellers out of the Purchase Price paid
to Sellers on a pro rata basis.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed or
construed to prevent the Company from paying any such fees or expenses in the
event this Agreement is terminated.

       6.9       Breach of Representations and Warranties.  Promptly upon any
Seller or the Company becoming aware of any breach of any of the

detailed written notice thereof to the Purchaser and shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to prevent or promptly remedy the same.

changes, additions, or events which may cause any change in or addition to the
Schedules delivered by them under this Agreement promptly after the occurrence
of the same and again at the Closing by delivery of appropriate updates to all
such Schedules.  No notification of a change or addition to a Schedule made
pursuant to this Section shall be deemed to cure any breach of any
representation or warranty resulting from such change or addition unless
Purchaser specifically agrees thereto in writing, nor shall any such
notification be considered to constitute or give rise to a waiver by Purchaser
of any condition set forth in this Agreement, unless Purchaser specifically
agrees thereto in writing.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to create
or impose on Purchaser any duty to examine or investigate any matter or thing
for the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties made by
Sellers herein.

       6.12      No Employment or Solicitation.  In the event this Agreement is
terminated for any reason, neither the Sellers nor the Company shall hire or

Purchaser will, and will cause its representatives to, deliver to the Company
all documents and other written materials, and all copies thereof, obtained by

statements and announcements as requested to comply, in the

24
    31
judgment of counsel, with any applicable law, rule or policy.  Sellers and
Purchasers shall issue a press release regarding the execution and delivery of

provided, however, that the execution and delivery of the Greene Consulting
Agreement shall be at the sole election of James A.  Greene, M.D. and, in the

capital stock of the Company owned by all Sellers.  The funds in Post-Closing
Escrow Account shall be used solely for the satisfaction of the liabilities of
the Sellers as specified under Article 11 of this Agreement.

                 (b)      Limited Power of Attorney.  Each Seller, jointly and
severally, makes, constitutes and appoints James A. Greene, M.D., (referred to
herein as "Sellers Agent"), as agent and attorney-in-fact, with full power of
substitution, in his, her or its name, place and

31
    38
stead to (i) retain and engage an escrow or trust company and escrow agent or
trustee in connection with the Post- Closing Escrow Account, (ii) retain and
engage counsel and other professional consultants which, in the sole opinion of
Sellers Agent, are required in connection with the establishment, maintenance
and operation of the Post-Closing Escrow Account, or required to defend any
real, actual, threatened or pending claim, demand or action brought by
Purchaser or any other person in connection with the satisfaction of
liabilities of the Sellers under Article 11 of this Agreement ("Post-Closing
Claims"), (iii) pay all fees, costs and expenses incurred in association with
the establishment, management and operation of the Post-Closing Escrow Account,
(iv) pay all fees, costs, expenses, judgments, damages and awards incurred in
connection with any Post-Closing Claims, (v) make, execute, sign, acknowledge,
swear to, record and file on each Seller's behalf (a) any escrow or trust
instructions in connection with the establishment, management and operation of
the Post-Closing Escrow Account, (b) all instruments that effect an amendment
or modification of the Post- Closing Escrow Account instructions, (c) any
documents, instruments or filings required to explain, protect against, defend
or resolve any Post-Closing Claims, and (vi) take such other actions, execute
such instruments and incur and pay such fees, costs and expenses as are
necessary to effect the purpose and intent of this Section 10.4.  Any
instructions delivered to the escrow agent may vary the terms and provisions of
this Section 10.4 as Sellers Agent reasonably determines necessary to meet any
requirements of the escrow agent or trustee, provided the purpose, intent and
effect of this Section 10.4 shall be at all times maintained.

                 (c)      Additional Provisions of Limited Power of Attorney.
The foregoing limited power of attorney:

                 (i)      is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable
       and survive the death or incapacity of each Seller;

                 (ii)     may be exercised either by signing separately as
       attorney-in-fact for each Seller or, after listing all of the Sellers
       executing an instrument, by a single signature of the person acting as
       attorney-in- fact for all of them; and

                 (iii)    shall survive the delivery of an assignment by a
       Seller of the whole or any portion of a Seller's interest;

       10.5      Funding of Certain Company Obligations.  It is understood that
the Company will not have sufficient cash on the date of Closing to pay the
monetary obligations owed by the Company to James A. Greene, M.D. described in
Schedule 8.1(h).  Purchaser covenants and agrees that, since such payments
constitute a deduction to the Purchase Price, it shall loan or otherwise
advance such funds to the Company on the date of Closing so that the Company
may satisfy the condition to the obligations of the Sellers set forth in
Section 8.1(h).

                          SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS
                AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNITY; POST-CLOSING MATTERS

       11.1      Representations and Warranties to Survive.

                 (a)      Survival.  All statements contained in any agreement,
certificate, instrument, schedule, or document delivered by or on behalf of any
of the parties pursuant to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be deemed representations and warranties by the delivering party
hereunder.  All representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by
the parties each to the other in this Agreement shall be true at the Closing
and shall survive the consummation of this Agreement and the Closing hereunder
for a period of one year, ending at midnight on the first anniversary of the
Closing Date; provided, however, that if, prior to the expiration of such one
year period, a state of facts shall have become known which threatens to give
rise to a liability against which any party hereto would be entitled to
indemnification hereunder and the indemnified party shall have given notice of
such facts to the indemnifying party, then the rights of the indemnified party
to indemnification with respect to such liability shall continue until such
liability shall have been finally determined and disposed of (including
disposition by the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with
respect to such liability); provided further, however, that if a claim for
indemnification is made pursuant to this Article 11, then such claim for
indemnification or any claim arising out of the wrongful failure to comply with
the provisions of this Article 11 shall survive until the expiration of the
applicable period of limitations with respect to such claim for
indemnification; and provided further, however, that such one year limitation
specified above shall not apply to the matters described in Section 11.4(d)
below.  With respect to the representations and warranties of the parties, such
representations and warranties shall be true as of and at the date of the
Closing but nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require or imply that
the accuracy of such representations and warranties shall apply on a continuing
basis as to facts existing after the date of the Closing.  Except to the extent
set forth in sub-paragraph (b) below, no investigation or examination made by
any party hereto shall constitute a waiver of any representation or warranty
and no representation or warranty shall be merged into the Closing hereunder.

                 (b)      Waiver.  Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty by the Sellers or any failure to
fulfill any agreement or covenant of the Sellers to be performed on or prior to
the Closing of which the Purchaser had actual knowledge at or prior to the
Closing.  For the purposes hereof, "actual knowledge of the Purchaser" shall
mean the actual knowledge of either James Ken Newman, President of Purchaser,
or James W. McAtee, Executive Vice President of Purchaser, of the specific
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or unfulfilled agreement or covenant.

       11.2      Indemnity.  Subject to the limitations set forth in Section
11.4 below,

                 (a)      Sellers.  Each Seller, jointly and severally (except
as to the representations and warranties contained in Article 3 which shall be
several and not joint), agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
Purchaser and the subsidiaries, shareholders, partners,

33
    40
directors, officers, employees and agents of Purchaser, from, against, and in
respect of, any loss, liability, claim, demand, or expense, including but not
limited to attorney, investigation and consultant fees and costs, and of any
other kind whatsoever arising out of or resulting from any of the following:

                 (i)      Any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, or failure
       to fulfill any agreement or covenant of the Sellers and the Company
       under this Agreement or under any other agreement or document delivered
       by the Sellers at Closing hereunder; and

                 (ii)     Any and all actions, suits, proceedings, demands,
       assessments, judgments, costs and legal and other expenses incident to
       any of the foregoing.

                 (b)      Purchaser.  Purchaser shall indemnify and hold each
Seller harmless from, against, and in respect of, any loss, liability, claim,
demand, or expense, including but not limited to attorney's fees and costs, of
any kind whatsoever, arising out of or resulting from any of the following:

                 (i)      Any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, or failure
       to fulfill any agreement or covenant of Purchaser under this Agreement
       or under any other agreement or document delivered by Purchaser to
       Sellers at Closing hereunder; and

                 (ii)     Any and all actions, suits, proceedings, demands,
       assessments, judgments, costs, and legal and other expenses incident to
       any of the foregoing.

       11.3      Indemnity Procedures.  In case any claim, demand or action
shall be brought by any third party including, without limitation, any
governmental authority, against a party entitled to indemnity under Section
11.2(a) or 11.2(b) above, such party shall promptly notify the other party or
parties, as the case may be, from whom indemnity is or may validly be sought in
writing and the indemnifying party or parties shall assume the defense thereof,
including the employment of counsel.  In addition, in case a party hereto shall
become aware of any facts which might result in any such claim, demand or
action, such party shall promptly notify the other party or parties who would
be obligated to provide indemnity hereunder with respect to such claim, demand
or action, and such other party or parties shall have the right to take such
action as it or they may deem appropriate to resolve such matter.  The
indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ  separate counsel
in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or
parties, unless the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized
by the indemnifying party or parties.  Any settlement of any action subject to
indemnity hereunder shall require the consent of the indemnified and the
indemnifying party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall
be given within five (5) days following the giving of notice thereof.  The
indemnifying party or parties shall not be liable for any settlement of any
action effected without its or their consent, but if settled with the consent
of the indemnifying party or parties or if there be a final judgment for the
plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party or parties shall indemnify
and hold harmless the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability
by reason of such settlement or judgment.  If requested by

34
    41
the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall cooperate with the
indemnifying party and its counsel and use its best efforts in contesting any
such claim or, if appropriate, in making any counter-claim or cross-complaint
against the party asserting the claim, provided that the indemnifying party
will reimburse the indemnified party for reasonable expenses incurred in so
cooperating upon presentation of receipts or other evidence of such expense.
The indemnifying party and its representatives shall have full and complete
access during reasonable hours to all books, records and files of the
indemnified party expressly related to the defense of any claim for
indemnification undertaken by the indemnifying party pursuant to this Article
11, or for any other purpose in connection therewith; provided that the
indemnifying party shall safeguard and maintain the confidentiality of all such
books, records and files.

       11.4      Limitations on Indemnification.

                 (a)      General Threshold.  Neither the Sellers nor the
Purchaser shall be obligated to indemnify the other party except to the extent
that the cumulative amount of all indemnifiable losses exceeds Ten Thousand
Dollars ($10,000.00) (the "Threshold"), which excess amount shall be
recoverable in accordance with the terms hereof; provided, however, that such
limitation set forth in this Section 11.4(a) shall not apply to the matters
described in Section 11.4(d) and provided further, however, that such
limitation set forth in this Section 11.4(a) shall not apply to matters arising
out of a breach of a representation or warranty of a Seller contained in
Article 3 of this Agreement.

                 (b)      Specific Limitations.  The following specific
limitations shall apply to the obligations of the Sellers to indemnify the
Purchaser, to-wit:

                 (i)      The obligations of all Sellers under this Article 11
       with respect to the representations and warranties of a Seller in
       Article 3 of this Agreement shall be limited to the Purchase Price paid
       to such Seller for the shares owned by such Seller paid by Purchaser;

                 (ii)     The obligations of each Seller, other than James A.
       Greene, M.D., under this Article 11 with respect to the representations
       and warranties of the Sellers under Article 4 of this Agreement or the
       failure to perform any agreement or covenant of the Sellers under
       Article 6 of this Agreement shall be limited to the portion of the
       Purchase Price paid to such Seller deposited into the Post-Closing
       Escrow Account by such Seller.

                 (iii)    The obligations of James A. Greene, M.D. under this
       Article 11 with respect to the representations and warranties of the
       Sellers contained in Article 4 of this Agreement or the failure to
       perform any agreement or covenant of the Sellers under Article 6 of this
       Agreement shall be limited to the funds deposited in the Post-Closing
       Escrow Account by James A. Greene, M.D. plus in the case of all such
       Article 4 representations and warranties except and excluding
       representations and warranties contained in Section 4.13(c), $400,000;
       provided, however, that in the event that the funds deposited in the
       Post-Closing Escrow Account are used to satisfy liabilities of the
       Sellers arising out of the representations and warranties of the Sellers
       under Article 4, other than

35
    42
       the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.13(c) of this
       Agreement, then the obligations of James A. Greene, M.D. under this
       Article 11 with respect to the representations and warranties of the
       Sellers contained in Article 4.13(c) of this Agreement shall be limited
       to the funds deposited in the Post-Closing Escrow Account by James A.
       Greene, M.D. plus an amount equal to the funds deposited in the
       Post-Closing Escrow Account by all Sellers (including James A. Greene,
       M.D.) used to satisfy the obligation of the Sellers under this Article
       11 with respect to the representation and warranties of the Sellers
       contained in Article 4, other than Section 4.13(c), up to a maximum of
       $400,000;

                 (iv)     In the event any liability arises under this Article
       11 for which Purchaser is entitled to indemnification, then Purchaser
       shall first seek and apply the funds deposited in the Post-Closing
       Escrow Account before seeking recourse directly against James A. Greene,
       M.D.; provided; however, that in the event that such liability arises
       out of a breach of a representation or warranty under Article 3, then
       Purchaser shall only have recourse to the funds deposited in the
       Post-Closing Escrow Account by such Seller but shall not be limited to
       only such funds in its recourse against such Seller; and

                 (v)      With respect to the breach of a representation and
       warranty contained in Article 4.13(c) of this Agreement, the Sellers
       shall not be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser unless and until the
       Company becomes liable for a payment arising out of (1) a final court
       judgment from a legal proceeding, (2) a settlement of a legal proceeding
       to which the Sellers have agreed, or (3) a settlement of threatened
       legal proceedings to which the Sellers have agreed.

                 (c)      Time Limits for Claims.  No claim for indemnification
may be made by any indemnified party in respect of indemnifiable losses unless
written notice thereof shall have been received by the indemnifying party on or
prior to one year after the date hereof; provided, however, that the one-year
limitation set forth in Section 11.1 and this Section 11.4(c) shall not apply
to the matters described in Section 11.4(d) as to which the indemnification
obligations hereunder shall expire six (6) months after the termination of the
applicable statute of limitations relating to the subject matter covered by
such provisions; and provided further, however, that in each case if, prior to
the applicable date of expiration, a specific state of facts shall have become
known which is reasonably likely to constitute or give rise to any
indemnifiable loss as to which indemnity may be payable and the indemnified
party shall have given notice of such facts to the indemnifying party and made
a claim for indemnification within such one-year period, then the right to
indemnification with respect thereto shall remain in effect until such matter
shall have been finally determined and disposed of and any indemnification due
in respect thereof shall have been paid.

                 (d)      Certain Matters.   The following are the matters 
referred to in Section 11.4(a) and Section 11.4(c):

                 (i)      Losses arising from fraud or an intentional
       misrepresentation on the part of any Seller; and

36
    43
                 (ii)     Losses arising from the intentional breach of any
       covenant or agreement by a Seller contained in this Agreement.

       11.5      Remedies; Default; Notice and Cure.  In the event of a breach
of this Agreement prior to the Closing, the non-breaching party shall have all
rights and remedies available at law, in equity or under the terms of the
Agreement.  If the Closing occurs, indemnification pursuant to this Article 11
is the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties after the Closing for matters
arising out of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
Sellers and the Purchaser set forth in this Agreement (without limiting the
rights of the parties under any other agreement), except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement.  No party shall be deemed in breach of its
obligations hereunder unless it has received written notice from the other
party of noncompliance with a term or provision of this Agreement and has
failed to cure such noncompliance within ten (10) days after receipt of such
notice.

       11.6      Severance Benefits.  On or prior to the Closing, Purchaser and
the Company shall determine which corporate level employees of the Company will
be terminated on the Closing Date.  Purchaser agrees that, as to all such
employees, there shall be a fund established by the Company in an aggregate
amount equal to the total of the amount of six months base salary on the
Effective Date for each such employee up to a maximum aggregate amount of
$225,000 and that, from such fund, severance benefits in amounts determined by
James A. Greene, M.D. up to a maximum amount equal to six months base salary
for the employee shall be paid by the Company to such employees; provided,
however, that each such employee shall receive a severance payment equal to not
less than one month base salary.  Severance pay shall be in addition to all
accrued but unused vacation leave and any other vested accrued benefits due as
a result of termination to such employee.

       11.7      Certain Post-Closing Management Contracts.  In the event that
the Purchase Price to the Sellers is determined by taking into account the
$300,000 reduction as contemplated by Section 9.1(j), then the Purchaser
further covenants and agrees that, in the event the Company or the Purchaser or
any subsidiary of the Purchaser enters into a management contract relating to
the operation of a mental health treatment unit and programs at any of the
hospitals listed on Schedule 11.7 after the Closing but on or before August 17,
1997, then Purchaser agrees that, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
execution of such management contract but in no event more than thirty (30)
days thereafter, it shall pay to the Sellers an amount equal to the amount
which the Sellers would have been entitled to receive at the Closing if such
$300,000 reduction had not been made in the calculation of the Purchase Price.
No payment shall be due and the provisions of this Section 11.7 shall not apply
in the event such $300,000 reduction is not made at the Closing.  Additionally,
no payment shall be due and the provisions of this Section 11.7 shall not apply
with respect to any such management contract executed after August 17, 1997 or
with respect to any other management contract with a hospital not listed in
Schedule 11.7.  In the event Purchaser enters into more than one management
contract with any of the hospitals listed on Schedule 11.7, Purchaser shall
nevertheless not be required to make any further payments to the Sellers beyond
the payment specified above applicable in the event any one management contract
is executed with any of such hospitals.

    44
                                   ARTICLE 12
                                NON-COMPETITION

       12.1      Covenant Not to Compete; Non-Solicitation.  For and in
consideration of the purchase by the Purchaser of the Shares pursuant to this
Agreement, and the payments payable by the Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement, James A.  Greene, M.D., the principal shareholder and chief
executive officer of the Company, covenants and agrees that he shall not,
directly or indirectly, as an employer, consultant, creditor, investor, owner,
agent, principal, partner, shareholder, or through any other kind of ownership
(other than ownership of securities of any publicly held entity in which
Greene, directly or indirectly, in the aggregate beneficially owns less than
two percent (2%) of any class of outstanding securities), or in any other
representative or individual capacity, do any of the following:

                 (i)      for a period until the later of the expiration of two
       (2) years from the date of this Agreement or one (1) year after the
       termination date of the Greene Consulting Agreement, engage in the
       operation or management of a mental health treatment unit or program
       operated in or in association with a general acute care hospital (the
       "Business") in the continental United States (the "Restricted Area");

                 (ii)     for a period until the later of the expiration of two
       (2) years from the date of this Agreement or one (1) year after the
       termination date of the Greene Consulting Agreement, engage in any
       business which calls upon, solicits, diverts or takes away any customer
       or customers of Purchaser or the Company in the Restricted Area for the
       purpose of selling or attempting to sell to any of said customers any
       products or services similar to any products or services heretofore sold
       or provided to any of such customers by Purchaser or the Company; and

                 (iii)    for a period until the later of the expiration of six
       (6) months from the date of this Agreement or six (6) months after the
       termination date of the Greene Consulting Agreement, engage in any
       business which solicits any present or future employee of Purchaser or
       the Company or initiates discussions with any such employee regarding
       his or her termination or resignation from employment with the Purchaser
       or the Company, so that such employee may accept employment with, or
       engagement as a partner, investor, shareholder, employee, agent or
       consultant with Greene, directly or indirectly, as specified above;
       provided, however, that Greene shall not be prohibited by this Agreement
       from employing or soliciting the employment of Diane R. Burkett or the
       employment of any other employee that the Purchaser or the Company
       terminates so long as such employment or solicitation of employment
       occurs after the date of such termination.

       12.2      Non-Disclosure.  Greene further covenants and agrees that all
information concerning the Company, including without limitation (i)
information regarding prices or premiums charged for products and services,
(ii) the assets, liabilities and financial condition of the Company, (iii) the
names and identities of customers and analyses of the amount and types of
products and services purchased by each such customer, (iv) the suppliers
utilized by the Company and its subsidiaries and the financial arrangements
with such providers, and (v) the

38
    45
amount of compensation to employees, constitute trade secrets and confidential,
proprietary business information which is the property of the Company and that,
unless otherwise required by law, from and after the date of this Agreement:

                 (a)      Greene shall use his best efforts and exercise utmost
       diligence to protect and safeguard all of such trade secrets and
       confidential, proprietary information;

                 (b)      Greene shall not, directly or indirectly, use, sell,
       license, publish, disclose or otherwise transfer or make available to
       others any of such trade secrets or confidential, proprietary
       information;

                 (c)      Without the prior written consent of the Company,
       Greene shall not, directly or indirectly, disclose any of such trade
       secrets or confidential, proprietary information; and

                 (d)      Greene shall not, directly or indirectly, use for his
       own benefit or for the benefit of another, any of such trade secrets or
       confidential, proprietary information.

It is expressly understood, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to any
information that was generally available to the public on a non-confidential
basis prior to the date of this Agreement or was or becomes generally available
to the public on a non-confidential basis from a third party who is not bound
to keep such information confidential.

         12.3    Nondisparagement.  For a period until the later of the
expiration of two (2) years and after the date of this Agreement or one (1)
year after the termination date of the Greene Consulting Agreement, Greene
further agrees that he shall not make or publish any statement, written or
oral, disparaging the reputation of Purchaser or the Company or their
respective subsidiaries, executive officers of the Purchaser or any of the
business services or products of the Purchaser or the Company or solicit or
encourage any hospital having a management contract with the Purchaser, its
subsidiaries or the Company to terminate such management contract.

         12.4    Reasonableness; Reformation.  Greene acknowledges and agrees
that (i) the provisions of this Article 12 are ancillary to the transaction
pursuant to which Greene sold and the Purchaser acquired the Shares, (ii) the
provisions of this Agreement contain reasonable limitations as to time,
geographical area and scope of activities to be restrained and do not impose a
greater restraint than is necessary to protect goodwill and other business
interests of the Company and its subsidiaries, (iii) if any portion of the
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement are held to be invalid,
unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then such portion of such
covenants shall be considered divisible as to time, scope of activities
covered, and geographical area, and (iv) if any court of competent jurisdiction
determines the specified time period, scope of activities covered, or the
specified geographical area applicable to any provision of this Agreement to be
invalid, unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, a lesser time
period, scope of activities covered, and/or geographical area which is
determined to be reasonable, non-arbitrary and not against public policy may be
enforced against Greene.

39
    46
         12.5    Remedies for Breach.  If Greene has failed to satisfactorily
cure any breach or threatened breach of any covenant or agreement contained
herein within ten (10) days after written notice of such breach or threatened
breach given by the Purchaser to Greene, any one or more of the following
remedies, as selected by the Purchaser in its sole discretion, shall be
available to the Purchaser in the event of a breach of this Agreement by Greene
hereunder:

                 (a)      Specific Performance.  In the event of a breach or
         threatened breach of any covenant or agreement of Greene in this
         Agreement, remedies at law will not adequately compensate the
         Purchaser for its injuries incurred as a result  thereof.
         Accordingly, injunctive and/or equitable relief shall be available to
         the Purchaser to specifically enforce this Agreement and prevent such
         breach and any continued breach of any covenant and agreement herein.

         in Section 12.5(a) above, in the event of any breach of any covenant
         or agreement of Greene herein, Purchaser may sue for damages arising
         out of such breach and otherwise enforce this Agreement and obtain all

documents to be delivered at Closing hereunder set forth the entire
understanding of the parties and supersede all prior agreements or
understandings, whether written or oral, with respect to the subject matter

written agreement executed by Purchaser and Sellers owning a majority of the
shares of capital stock of the Company owned by all the Sellers.  It is
expressly understood that Sellers owning a majority of the shares of capital
stock of the Company owned by all the Sellers may amend or modify this
Agreement, in any respect, including, without limitation, changing the purchase
price of the shares so long as any such amendment applies equally to all the
Sellers.

         15.4    Binding Effect/Assignability.  This Agreement shall extend to
and be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their
respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns.  Purchaser

Purchaser without the necessity of seeking the consent of the Sellers;

result of such assignment and that, in addition to Purchaser remaining liable,
any such assignee shall assume and become liable for any and all of Purchaser's
obligations under this Agreement.  None of the Sellers shall be entitled to
assign any of their respective rights or obligations under this Agreement;
provided, however, that the rights and obligations of a Seller may be assigned
by operation of law or may be assigned to an individual retirement account,
pension plan, trust or other entity under the control of such Seller but any
such assignment shall not relieve or release such Seller of any

44
    51
obligations hereunder as a result of such assignment and that, in addition to
such Seller remaining liable, any such assignee shall assume and become liable
for any and all of such Seller's obligations under this Agreement. In
connection with any such assignment, a Seller may transfer all or any portion
of the Shares owned by the Seller and thereby effect an assignment on the basis

this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and shall constitute a part
of this Agreement.

         15.6    Invalid Provisions.  If any provision of this Agreement is
held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under present or future laws
effective during the term hereof, such provisions shall be fully severable and
this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof with the remaining
provisions remaining in full force and effect and not affected by the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision or by severance herefrom.  Furthermore, in
lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision there shall be added
automatically as part of this Agreement a provision similar in terms to such
illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision as may be possible and still be
legal, valid and enforceable.

         15.7    Headings/Captions.  The captions to sections and subsections
of this Agreement have been inserted solely for convenience and reference, and
shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

         15.8    Waiver; Remedies.  Waiver by any party hereto of any breach of
or exercise of any rights under this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a
waiver of similar or other breaches or rights or a future breach of the same
duty.  The failure of a party to take any action by reason of any such breach
or to exercise any such right shall not deprive any party of the right to take
any action at any time while such breach or condition giving rise to such right
continues.  Except as expressly limited by this Agreement, the parties shall
have all remedies permitted to them by this Agreement or law, and all such
remedies shall be cumulative.

         15.9    Attorney's Fees and Costs.  In the event of a breach by any
party to this Agreement and commencement of a subsequent legal action in a

prospective legal action, the prevailing party in any such dispute shall be
entitled to reimbursement of reasonable attorney's fees and court costs,
including, but not limited to, the costs of expert witnesses, transportation,
lodging and meal costs of the parties and witnesses, costs of transcript
preparation and other reasonable and necessary direct and incidental costs of

                               FIRST AMENDMENT TO
                            STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

This First Amendment to Stock Purchase Agreement (the "First
Amendment") is made on March 14, 1997 by and between Horizon Mental Health
Management, Inc. ("Purchaser"), James A. Greene, M.D. ("Greene") and Geriatric
Medical Care, Inc. ("the "Company").

         WHEREAS, the Purchaser, Greene and other shareholders of the Company,
and the Company entered into that certain Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Stock
Purchase Agreement') dated as of February 24, 1997 relating to the sales of
shares of capital stock of the Company; and

         WHEREAS, the Stock Purchase Agreement may be amended by an agreement
in writing between the Purchaser, the Company and Sellers (as such term is
defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement) owning a majority of the shares of
capital stock of the Company owned by all the Sellers that are parties to the
Stock Purchase Agreement, so long as such amendment applies equally to all the
Sellers; and

         WHEREAS, Greene owns a majority of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company; and

         WHEREAS, the parties desire to amend the Stock Purchase Agreement as
hereinafter set forth and such amendment shall apply equally to all the
Sellers;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual terms and
conditions herein contained, the parties hereby agree as follows:

         1.      Effective Time.  The parties acknowledge that, although the
Closing under the Stock Purchase Agreement is being held on March 14, 1997, the
effective time of the transaction shall be as of 12:01 a.m. March 15, 1997.

         2.      Exhibit A to Stock Purchase Agreement.  The parties hereby
agree that Exhibit A to the Stock Purchase Agreement is hereby amended in its
entirety and that Exhibit A attached to this First Amendment shall be and
hereby is substituted as the Exhibit A to the Stock Purchase Agreement in all
respects.

         3.      Disputed Instruments.  The parties hereby agreed, in order to
resolve all issues relating to the disputed instruments described in Section
2.6 of the Stock Purchase Agreement, as follows:

                 (a)      The exercise price of the Ramsay Warrant and the
outstanding principal balances of the Convertible Notes have been included as
additional amounts in determining the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.2 of
the Stock Purchase Agreement.

1
    55
                 (b)      In no event shall the Sellers be entitled to receive
or be paid all or any portion of the Purchase Price attributable to the Ramsay
Warrant which otherwise would have been paid to Sellers if the Ramsay Warrant
had not been outstanding on the date of Closing whether pursuant to Section 2.6
of the Stock Purchase Agreement or any other provision thereof.

                 (c)      Sellers have acknowledged and agreed that the holders
of the Convertible Notes have retained the right to convert the Convertible
Notes.  Sellers shall have no right to all or any portion of the Purchase Price
attributable to the Convertible Notes which otherwise would have been paid to
Sellers if the holders of the Convertible Notes had not retained the right to
convert such Convertible Notes.  Instead, the holders of the Convertible Notes
shall have the right to participate as a Seller under the Stock Purchase
Agreement upon exercising such right of conversion.

         4.      Payment of Purchase Price.  The parties have agreed that
Purchaser shall pay the Purchase Price due to Sellers at the closing by wire
transfer to the trust account of Counsel to the Sellers.  Counsel to the
Sellers shall distribute to the Sellers by check their respective portions of
the Purchase Price.  Purchaser shall have no obligation or liability for the
distribution of such proceeds to the Sellers.  Purchaser agrees to advance to
such trust account the full portions of the Purchase Price attributable to all
the Convertible Notes even though all the holders thereof have not exercised
the right to convert on prior to the Closing.  The parties agreed that such
holders may exercise such right to convert after the date of Closing and
participate as a Seller under the Stock Purchase Agreement.  However, such
holders shall not be paid their respective portion of the Purchase Price until
such right to convert has been properly exercised and, if any holder does not
exercise such right to convert and instead the principal amount of the
Convertible Note is paid to such Seller, then the portion of the Purchase Price
attributable to such Convertible Note shall be returned by Counsel to the
Seller to Purchaser.  A properly exercised Convertible Note shall include a
written election to convert, a duly endorsed original Convertible Note and an
executed Signature Page and Joinder Agreement.  Upon receipt of the foregoing
documents, Counsel for the Sellers shall have the authority to make payment to
the converting holder of the Convertible Notes without further authorization by
either Sellers, the Company or Purchaser.  Upon such payment to the converting
holders of the Convertible Notes, the Counsel for Sellers shall promptly send
to Purchaser the originals of the election to convert, the endorsed Convertible
Note and the executed Signature Page and Joinder Agreement.

         In the event that the provisions of Section 11.7 of the Stock Purchase
Agreement are satisfied by the execution of a qualifying management agreement,
the Purchaser shall be obligated to pay $270,000 to the Seller which payment
shall be made within ten (10) days after execution of the management agreement.
Payment shall be made by wire transfer to the trust account of Counsel to the
Sellers which shall distribute such additional payment to the Sellers on a pro
rata basis.

         5.      Post-Closing Escrow.  Purchaser and Sellers have agreed that
(a) in consideration of the waiver of the Sellers to any claim to the portion
of the Purchase Price attributable to the Ramsay Warrant (even if the Ramsay
Warrant is subsequently determined not to be outstanding

2
    56
or otherwise exercisable), the amount of the Post-Closing Escrow Account shall
be reduced to $540,000 and (b) in consideration of the reduction in the Net
Worth of the Company on the date of Closing, the amount of $60,000 shall not be
deposited in the Post-Closing Escrow Account, but shall be paid to the Company
for working capital purposes.  As such, the $540,000 escrow funds shall be paid
by Purchaser in the amount of $480,000 to the escrow account and $60,000 to the
Company, as to which $60,000 neither Purchaser nor the Company shall have any
obligation or liability of any kind under any circumstances to repay or refund
such amount to Sellers.  In consideration of such agreement by the Sellers,
Purchaser has waived satisfaction of the condition precedent to its obligations
under Section 9.1(m) of the Stock Purchase Agreement.

         6.      Non-Competition.  For the purposes of clarifying Section 12.1
of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Purchaser expressly agrees that (a) Greene may
solicit the employment of and employ Diane R. Burkett at any time, whether or
not employed by Purchaser at such time and (b) Greene may continue his
ownership of The Center for Health and Creative Aging, P.C. provided that such
professional corporation only continue to engage in the business activity in
which it is currently engaged and expressly does engage in the management of

 AGREEMENT BETWEEN HORIZONS' STOCKHOLDERS

1

                                                                    EXHIBIT 10.2

                                   AMENDMENT

This Amendment is made and effective this 10th day of February, 1997, by and
among Horizon Mental Health Management, Inc., a Texas corporation
("Purchaser"), and Joseph R. Bona, M.D., Nancy J. Simons, Ph.D., John G. Toms,
Ph.D., William L. Kale, Ph.D., and David E. Stenmark, Ph.D. (collectively
referred to herein as the "Sellers").

WHEREAS, Purchase and Sellers have entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement
dated the 31st day of July, 1996 (the "Agreement"), and

WHEREAS, Purchaser and Sellers desire to make certain changes to the Agreement.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual terms and
conditions contained herein, the Purchaser and the Sellers hereby agree as
follows:

1.       Paragraph 2.3(f) shall be added to the Agreement as follows:

         (f)     Final Reconciliation.  On or before July 15, 1997, and as of
June 30, 1997, Purchaser shall deliver to Sellers a Final Reconciliation
Statement of Income.  The Final Reconciliation Statement of Income will adjust
the Statement of Income prepared and delivered in accordance with paragraph
2.3(e) above by incorporating any subsequent activity involving accrued
expenses and accounts receivable, but shall otherwise be prepared in accordance
with the same requirements of paragraph 2.3(e).  Sellers shall have 30 days
from delivery to review the adjustments made and to notify Purchaser of any
dispute with such adjustments.  If Sellers fail to notify Purchaser of any
dispute within the thirty day period, the Final Reconciliation Statement of
Income shall be deemed to be final and conclusive and shall be utilized to
calculate the Reconciled Purchase Price.  Any disputes to the adjustments shall
be handled in the same manner as in paragraph 2.3(e).  The Reconciled Purchase
Price shall be compared to the Purchase Price previously paid, and any amounts
owing to Purchaser or Seller shall be paid within 30 days of determination of
the Reconciled Purchase Price.

All other terms and conditions not modified by this Amendment shall remain in
full force and effect.
    2
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Amendment on the date set
forth above.

EXHIBIT 11.1

                     HORIZON MENTAL HEALTH MANAGEMENT, INC.
                       COMPUTATIONS OF EARNINGS PER SHARE
                  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT FOR PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

(A)      Any computational differences between the primary and fully diluted
         EPS are the result of using the average price in the primary
         computation and the ending price (which was higher) in the fully
         diluted computation.

(1)      The calculations for primary and fully diluted net income per share
         are submitted in accordance with Regulation S-K Item 601(b)(11).

(2)      The Board of Directors of the Company approved a three-for-two stock
         split effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend, pursuant to which
         one additional share of Common Stock of the Company was issued on
         January 31, 1997 for every two shares of Common Stock held by
         stockholders of record at close of business on January 22, 1997. Upon
         effecting the stock split/dividend, the stock options and their
         related exercise prices were adjusted proportionately. Such stock
         split/dividend has been retroactively reflected herein.
