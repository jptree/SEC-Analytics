NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Unaudited)

Note 1   Basis of Presentation  
John B. Sanfilippo   Son, Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Delaware in 1979 as the successor by merger to an Illinois corporation that was incorporated in
1959. As used herein, unless the context otherwise indicates, the term  Company  refers
collectively to John B. Sanfilippo   Son, Inc. and its previously wholly owned subsidiary, JBS
International, Inc., which was dissolved in November, 2004. The Company s fiscal year ends on the
final Thursday of June each year, and typically consists of fifty-two weeks (four thirteen week
quarters). Fiscal 2005, however, contained fifty-three weeks, with the fourth quarter containing
fourteen weeks.

In the opinion of the Company s management, the accompanying statements present fairly the
consolidated statements of operations, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of
cash flows, and reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments which, in
the opinion of management, are necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the interim
periods. The interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for a full year. It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s 2005 Annual Report filed
on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2005.

Note 2   Inventories  
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out) or market. Inventories consist of
the following (in thousands):

Note 3   Earnings Per Common Share  
Earnings per common share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock
and Class A Common Stock outstanding during the period. The following table presents the
reconciliation of the weighted average shares outstanding used in computing earnings per share:

366,440 stock options with a weighted average exercise price of $13.62 were excluded from the
computation of diluted earnings per share for both the quarter and twenty-six weeks ended December
29, 2005 due to the net loss for both the quarterly and twenty-six week periods. 3,000 stock
options, with a weighted average exercise price of $32.30, were excluded from the computation of
diluted earnings per share for both the quarter and twenty-six weeks ended December 23, 2004 due to
the exercise price exceeding the average market price of the Common Stock.

Note 4   Stock-Based Compensation  
Under the Company s stock option plans, the Company may grant incentive and non-qualified options
to purchase Common Stock at an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market value at the
grant date, as determined by the Board of Directors. Options vest over four years and vested
options are exercisable in part or in full at any time prior to the expiration date of 5 to 10
years from the date of the grant.

At the Company s annual meeting of stockholders on October 28, 1998, the Company s stockholders
approved the 1998 Equity Incentive Plan under which awards of non-qualified options and stock-based
awards may be made.

7

Table of Contents   

There are 700,000 shares of common stock authorized for issuance to certain key
employees and  outside directors  (i.e. directors who are not employees of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries). At December 29, 2005, there were 157,000 options available for distribution
under this plan.

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),  Share-Based Payment  ( SFAS 123R ). This Statement requires
companies to expense the estimated fair value of stock options and similar equity instruments
issued to employees over the requisite service period. FAS 123R eliminates the alternative to use
the intrinsic method of accounting provided for in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ( APB 25 ), which generally resulted in no compensation
expense recorded in the financial statements related to the grant of stock options to employees if
certain conditions were met.

Effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified
prospective method, which requires the Company to record compensation expense for all awards
granted after the date of adoption, and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that
remain outstanding at the date of adoption. Accordingly, prior period amounts presented herein have
not been restated to reflect the adoption of SFAS 123R.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company included all tax benefits resulting from the
exercise of stock options in operating cash flows in its consolidated statements of cash flows. In
accordance with SFAS 123R, for the period beginning with first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company
includes the tax benefits from the exercise of stock options in financing cash flows in its
consolidated statement of cash flows.

The Company determines fair value of such awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The
following weighted average assumptions were used to value the Company s grants through the second
quarter of 2006: 3.75 and 6.25 years expected life; expected stock volatility from 51.2% to 56.9%;
risk-free interest rate of 4.07% to 4.44%; expected forfeitures of 0%; and expected dividend yield
of 0% during the expected term.

The expected term of the awards was determined using the  simplified method  as stated in SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 107 that utilizes the following formula: ((vesting term   original contract
term)/2). Expected stock volatility was determined based on historical volatility for either the
3.75 or 6.25 year-period preceding the measurement date. The risk-free rate was based on the yield
curve in effect at the time options were granted, using U.S. treasury constant maturities over the
expected life of the option. Expected forfeitures were determined based on the Company s
expectations and past experiences. Expected dividend yield was based on the Company s dividend
policy at the time the options were granted.

Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, stock-based compensation is measured at
the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting
period. Stock-based compensation expense was $156 thousand and $288 thousand for the quarter and
twenty six weeks ended December 29, 2005, respectively, and the related tax benefit for
non-qualified stock options was $1 thousand and $3 thousand for the quarter and twenty-six weeks
ended December 29, 2005, respectively.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company accounted for stock-based awards to employees using
the intrinsic method in accordance with APB 25. The following table illustrates the effect on net
income for the quarter and twenty-six weeks ended December 23, 2004 and earnings per share if the
Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R (in thousands, except
per-share amounts):

Activity in the Company s stock option plans for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2006 was as
follows:

The weighted average fair value of options granted and the total intrinsic value of options
exercised was $9.45 and $29 thousand, respectively, during the first twenty-six weeks of 2006.

A Summary of the status of the Company s non-vested shares as of December 29, 2005, and changes
during the twenty-six weeks ended December 29, 2005, is presented below:

As of December 29, 2005, there was $1.47 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the Company s stock option plans.
The Company expects to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of 1.73 years. The total
fair value of shares vested during the twenty-six weeks ended December 29, 2005 was $425 thousand.

Note 5   Retirement Plan  
On August 25, 2005, the Company s Compensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
approved a Supplemental Retirement Plan (the  SERP ) to cover certain executive officers of the
Company. The purpose of the SERP is to provide an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation
monthly benefit upon retirement, disability or death to a select group of management and key
employees of the Company. The monthly benefit is based upon each individual s earnings and his
number of years of service. Administrative expenses include the following net periodic benefit
costs (amounts in thousands):

Additionally, an intangible asset and an additional minimum liability for accumulated benefit
obligations of $10.47 million were recorded upon adoption of the SERP during the first quarter of
fiscal 2006.

Note 6   Distribution Channel and Product Type Sales Mix  
The Company operates in a single reportable segment through which it sells various nut products
through multiple distribution channels.

The following summarizes net sales by distribution channel (in thousands):

The
following summarizes sales by product type as a percentage of total gross sales. The
information is based on gross sales, rather than net sales, because certain adjustments, such as
promotional discounts, are not allocable to product type.

Note 7   Comprehensive Income  
The Company accounts for comprehensive income in accordance with SFAS 130,  Reporting Comprehensive
Income . The Company currently has no components of comprehensive income that are required to be
disclosed separately. Consequently, comprehensive income equals net income for all periods
presented.

Note 8   Credit Facilities  
The Company was not in compliance with the funded debt to twelve-month EBITDA ratio covenants under
its Bank Credit Facility and its primary long-term financing facility (the  Note Agreement ) and
the minimum twelve-month EBITDA requirement under its Bank Credit Facility as of December 29, 2005.
The Company received waivers not to demand payment of amounts outstanding under these agreements
for non-compliance with these three financial covenants as of December 29, 2005. However, the
Company expects to not be in compliance with these same three covenants for the quarter ending
March 30, 2006. Accordingly, $57.8 million of long-term was reclassified as a current liability. In
addition to the waivers, the Bank Credit Facility was amended to provide an additional $20.0
million of availability and the Note Agreement was amended whereby an additional fee of 1.00% per
annum will be incurred by the Company for the time period for which compliance with the funded debt
to twelve-month EBITDA ratio is not obtained. Non-compliance with financial covenants constitutes
an event of default as defined in the financing agreements. Upon an event of default, outstanding
amounts, including accrued interest, under the financing facilities would become immediately due at
the demand of the lenders. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully
renegotiate these financing agreements with its lenders or that the terms of the credit agreements
will not be substantially changed. The inability of the Company to renegotiate the terms of its
existing credit facilities or obtain new financing could have a material adverse effect on the
Company s business and financial position.

Note 9   Interest Cost  
The following is a breakout of interest cost:

Note 10   Subsequent Events  
Prior to acquiring the Elgin, Illinois site being used for the Company s facility consolidation
project, the Company and certain related party partnerships entered into a Development Agreement
with the City of Elgin, Illinois (the  Development Agreement ) for the development and purchase of
the land where a new facility could be constructed (the  Original Site ). The Development
Agreement provided for certain conditions, including but not limited to the completion of
environmental and asbestos remediation procedures, the inclusion of the property in the Elgin
enterprise zone and the establishment of a tax incremental financing district covering the
property. The Company fulfilled its remediation obligations under the Development Agreement during
fiscal 2005. The Company s costs under the Development Agreement totaling $6.8 million are recorded
as  Other Assets  at December 29, 2005 and June 30, 2005 and $4.9 million at December 23, 2004. On
February 1, 2006, the Company and the related party partnerships entered into a Termination
Agreement with the City of Elgin whereby the Development Agreement
was terminated and the City of Elgin became obligated to convey the property to the Company and the partnerships
within thirty days. Upon such conveyance by the City of Elgin, the partnerships have agreed to
transfer (by quit claim deed) their interests to the Company without consideration. After the
property is conveyed, the Original Site will be marketed to potential buyers. The Company has
reviewed the asset under the Development Agreement for realization, and concluded that no
adjustment of the carrying value was required as of December 29, 2005.

The Company, along with related party partnerships that own a portion of the Company s existing
Chicago area facilities, is in the process of selling these facilities. The Company intends to
lease back from the ultimate purchasers that portion of the facilities that are necessary to run
the Company s business while the facility consolidation project is completed in Elgin. The Company
estimates that these sale and leaseback transactions will be consummated during the third quarter
of fiscal 2006. Based upon the bids received, the Company believes that proceeds received from the
sales will exceed the Company s carrying value of these assets. The Company s Board of Directors
appointed an independent board committee to explore alternatives with respect to the Company s
existing leases for the properties owned by the related party partnerships. After negotiations
with the partnerships, the independent committee approved a non-binding letter of intent whereby:
(i) the current related party leases would terminate without penalty to the Company; (ii) the
Company would receive $2.0 million for the portion of the Busse Road property that it owns; and
(iii) the Company will sell its Selma, Texas properties to the partnerships for $14.3 million (an
estimate of fair value and in excess of its carrying value) and lease them back. The sale price and
rental rate for the Selma, Texas properties were determined by an independent appraiser. The lease
for the Selma, Texas properties will have a ten-year term at a fair market value rent, with three
five-year renewal options. In addition, the Company will have an option to repurchase these
properties from the partnerships after five years at 95% of the then fair market value.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial
Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

INTRODUCTION 

The Company is a processor, packager, marketer and distributor of shelled and inshell nuts. The
Company also markets or distributes, and in most cases manufactures or processes, a diverse product
line of food and snack items, including peanut butter, candy and confections, natural snacks and
trail mixes, sunflower seeds, corn snacks and sesame products. The Company sells to the consumer
market under a variety of private labels and under the Company s brand names, primarily Fisher. The
Company also sells to the industrial food service contract packaging and export markets.

The Company s results through the second quarter of fiscal 2006 were disappointing in terms of both
sales and earnings. Net sales increased by 4.4% to $191.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal
2006 compared to $183.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2005, but sales volume measured in
pounds decreased by 11.6%. Net sales increased by 3.8% to $329.7 million for the first twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2006 compared to $317.7 million for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2005, but
sales volume measured in pounds decreased by 11.1% over this period. The primary factor causing the
decline in sales volume was the higher costs of tree nuts during the first half of fiscal 2006 when
compared to the first half of fiscal 2005, which led to decreased demand for nut products. Net
income decreased to a net loss of $0.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to
net income of $6.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Net income decreased to a net
loss of $1.2 million for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2006 compared to net income of $9.0
million for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2005.

The Company s unfavorable operating results have caused non-compliance with certain restrictive
covenants under its financing facilities. Specifically, the Company failed to achieve the minimum
rolling twelve-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA )
requirement under the Bank Credit Facility, as defined below, and exceeded the maximum allowable
funded debt to twelve-month EBITDA ratio under both the Bank Credit Facility and the Note
Agreement, as defined below. The Company received waivers not to demand payment of amounts
outstanding under these agreements for non-compliance with these three financial covenants as of
December 29, 2005. However, the Company expects to not be in compliance with these same three
covenants for the quarter ending March 30, 2006. Accordingly, $57.8 million of long-term was
reclassified as a current liability. In addition to the waivers, the Bank Credit Facility was
amended to provide an additional $20.0 million of availability and the Note Agreement was amended
whereby an additional fee of 1.00% per annum will be incurred by the Company for the time period
for which compliance with the funded debt to twelve-month EBITDA ratio is not obtained.
Non-compliance with financial covenants constitutes an event of default as defined in the financing
agreements. Upon an event of default, outstanding amounts, including accrued interest, under the
financing facilities would become immediately due at the demand of the lender. While the Company
fully expects to renegotiate the terms of the Bank Credit Facility and the Note Agreement during
the third quarter of fiscal 2006, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to
successfully renegotiate these financing agreements with its lenders or that the terms of the
credit agreements will not be substantially changed. If the Bank Credit Facility is not renewed,
the Company believes that it will be able to secure necessary financing from other lenders who have
expressed interest in negotiating with the Company. If the Company is not able to renegotiate the
terms of its credit agreements, it will have to consider financing alternatives which might include
identifying alternative sources of debt or equity capital, or an unplanned sale of assets or the
curtailment of the facility consolidation project. The inability of the Company to renegotiate the
terms of its existing credit facilities or obtain new financing could have a material adverse
effect on the Company s business and financial position.

The Company is currently undertaking a facility consolidation project as a means of expanding its
production capacity and enhancing its operations efficiency. As a result, the Company will
consolidate its six Chicago area facilities into a single location in Elgin, Illinois. Of the six
current facilities, two facilities and approximately 20% of a third facility are owned by the
Company. Eighty percent of the third facility, and a fourth facility, are leased by the Company
from certain partnerships owned by executive officers and directors of the Company and their family
members. The remaining two facilities are leased by the Company from independent third parties.

As part of the facility consolidation project, on April 15, 2005, the Company closed on the $48.0
million purchase of a site in Elgin, Illinois (the  Current Site ) with the final $46.0 million
paid using available funds under the Bank Credit Facility. The Current Site includes both an office
building and a warehouse. The Company is leasing 41.5% of the office building back to the seller
for a three year period, with options for an additional seven years. The remaining portion of the
office building may be leased to third parties. The 653,302 square foot warehouse building is being
expanded to approximately 1,000,000 square feet and will be modified to accommodate the Company s
needs.

12

Table of Contents   

Groundbreaking for the expansion occurred in August 2005. The construction is expected to
be completed in the first half of calendar 2006. The Company s existing Chicago area operations are
expected to be moved to the Current Site over a three-year period as operations permit.

The Company performed an analysis of its existing assets at its Chicago locations, and based on
this analysis identified those assets which will be transferred to the Current Site and those that
will not. For those assets which are not expected to be transferred to the Current Site, the
remaining depreciation period has been reduced to reflect the Company s estimate of the useful
lives of these assets. In addition to the assets being transferred, new machinery and equipment
will also be installed at the Current Site. The Company currently anticipates that operations will
be fully integrated into the Current Site by December 2008.

Total remaining capital expenditures for the facility consolidation project are estimated to be
approximately $30   $40 million, which the Company expects to finance through the Bank Credit
Facility, available cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of existing facilities and
rental income from the office building at the Current Site. The Bank Credit Facility expires on May
31, 2006. While the Company is currently negotiating with its lenders under the Bank Credit
Facility and fully expects to extend the Bank Credit Facility, no assurances can be made that the
Bank Credit Facility will be extended or renewed at favorable terms. Also, waivers and/or
modifications to the Bank Credit Facility and Note Agreement will be required for the probable
non-compliance with financial covenants under the Bank Credit Facility and Note Agreement for the
third quarter of fiscal 2006. See  Factors That May Affect Future Results   Risks and
Uncertainties Regarding Facility Consolidation Project. 

This facility consolidation project is anticipated to achieve two primary objectives. First, the
consolidation is intended to generate cost savings through the elimination of redundant costs, such
as interplant freight, and improvements in manufacturing efficiencies. Second, the new facility is
expected to initially increase production capacity by 25% to 40% and to provide substantially more
square footage than the aggregate space now available in the Company s existing Chicago area
facilities to support future growth in the Company s business. The facility consolidation project
is expected to allow the Company to pursue certain new business opportunities that currently are
not available due to the lack of production capacity.

The Company, along with related party partnerships that own a portion of the Company s existing
Chicago area facilities, is in the process of selling these facilities. The Company intends to
lease back from the ultimate purchasers that portion of the facilities that are necessary to run
the Company s business while the facility consolidation project is completed in Elgin. The Company
estimates that these sale and leaseback transactions will be consummated during the third quarter
of fiscal 2006. Based upon the bids received, the Company believes that proceeds received from the
sales will exceed the Company s carrying value of these assets. The Company s Board of Directors
appointed an independent board committee to explore alternatives with respect to the Company s
existing leases for the properties owned by the related party partnerships. After negotiations
with the partnerships, the independent committee approved a non-binding letter of intent whereby:
(i) the current related party leases would terminate without penalty to the Company; (ii) the
Company would receive $2.0 million for the portion of the Busse Road property that it owns; and
(iii) the Company will sell its Selma, Texas properties to the partnerships for $14.3 million (an
estimate of fair value and in excess of its carrying value) and lease them back. The sale price and
rental rate for the Selma, Texas properties were determined by an independent appraiser. The lease
for the Selma, Texas properties will have a ten-year term at a fair market value rent, with three
five-year renewal options. In addition, the Company will have an option to repurchase these
properties from the partnerships after five years at 95% of the then fair market value.

Prior to acquiring the Current Site, the Company and certain related party partnerships entered
into a Development Agreement with the City of Elgin, Illinois (the  Development Agreement ) for the
development and purchase of the land where a new facility could be constructed (the  Original
Site ). The Development Agreement provided for certain conditions, including but not limited to
the completion of environmental and asbestos remediation procedures, the inclusion of the property
in the Elgin enterprise zone and the establishment of a tax incremental financing district covering
the property. The Company fulfilled its remediation obligations under the Development Agreement
during fiscal 2005. The Company s costs under the Development Agreement totaling $6.8 million are
recorded as  Other Assets  at December 29, 2005. On February 1, 2006, the Company and the related
party partnerships entered into a Termination Agreement with the City of Elgin whereby the
Development Agreement was terminated and the City of Elgin became obligated to
convey the property to the Company and the partnerships within thirty days. Upon such conveyance by
the City of Elgin, the partnerships have agreed to transfer (by quit claim deed) their interests to
the Company without consideration. After the property is conveyed, the Original Site will be
marketed to potential buyers. The Company has reviewed the asset under the Development Agreement
for realization, and concluded that no adjustment of the carrying value was required as of December
29, 2005.

The Company s business is seasonal. Demand for peanut and other nut products is highest during the
months of October, November and December. Peanuts, pecans, walnuts and almonds, the Company s
principal raw materials, are

13

Table of Contents   

primarily purchased between August and February and are processed
throughout the year until the following harvest. As a result of this seasonality, the Company s
personnel requirements rise during the last four months of the calendar year. This seasonality
also impacts capacity utilization at the Company s Chicago area facilities, with these facilities
routinely operating at full capacity during the last four months of the calendar year. The
Company s working capital requirements generally peak during the third quarter of the Company s
fiscal year.

Total inventories were approximately $209.5 million at December 29, 2005, a decrease of $8.1
million, or 3.7%, from the balance at June 30, 2005, and a decrease of $0.3 million, or 0.1%, over
the balance at December 23, 2004. The decrease from June 30, 2005 to September 29, 2005 is due
primarily to the seasonality of crop procurement. While the dollar value of inventories at December
29, 2005 is virtually unchanged from the dollar value at December 23, 2004, there are significant
variations by nut type. The significantly higher cost of almonds resulted in a 31.9% increase in
almond inventories despite an 18.8% decrease in the quantities of almonds on hand. Inshell walnut
inventories increased 45.7% due to higher purchases of walnuts in fiscal 2006 than fiscal 2005.
Offsetting these increases to inventories were a decrease in finished goods and a decrease in
inshell peanuts due to a change in the way that peanuts are procured. Net accounts receivable were
$47.2 million at December 29, 2005, an increase of approximately $8.2 million, or 21.0%, over the
balance at June 30, 2005, and a decrease of $1.3 million, or 2.6% from the balance at December 23,
2004. The increase from June 30, 2005 to December 29, 2005 is due to higher monthly sales in
December 2005 than in June 2005.

The Company faces a number of challenges in the future. The Company s Chicago area processing
facilities operate at full capacity at certain times during the year. If the Company experiences
growth in unit volume sales, it could exceed its capacity to meet the demand for its products,
especially prior to the completion of the facility consolidation project. The Company faces
potential disruptive effects on its business, such as cost overruns for the construction of the new
facility or business interruptions that may result from the transfer of production to the new
facility. In addition, the Company will continue to face the ongoing challenges of its business
such as food safety and regulatory issues and the maintenance and growth of its customer base. See
 Factors That May Affect Future Results.  On a positive note, on February 1, 2006, the Company was
informed by the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice that the antitrust
investigation of the peanut shelling industry with respect to the Company is now closed.

The Company s fiscal year ends on the final Thursday of June each year, and typically consists of
fifty-two weeks (four thirteen week quarters). Fiscal 2005, however, contained fifty-three weeks,
with the fourth quarter containing fourteen weeks. References herein to fiscal 2006 are to the
fiscal year ending June 29, 2006. References herein to fiscal 2005 are to the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2005. As used herein, unless the context otherwise indicates, the term  Company  refers
collectively to John B. Sanfilippo   Son, Inc. and its previously wholly owned subsidiary, JBS
International, Inc., which was dissolved in November 2004.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Net Sales   
Net sales increased to $191.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 from $183.0 million for
the second quarter of fiscal 2005, an increase of $8.1 million, or 4.4%. Net sales increased to
$329.7 million for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2006 from $317.7 million for the first
twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2005, an increase of $12.1 million, or 3.8%. The overall increase in net
sales, for both the quarterly and twenty-six week periods, was due generally to higher prices
caused by higher commodity costs, especially for almonds and pecans. While sales prices increased,
total pounds shipped decreased by 11.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 when compared to the
second quarter of fiscal 2005 and decreased by 11.1% for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2006
when compared to the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2005.

The decrease in sales volume was caused mainly by decreases in the Company s consumer and
industrial distribution channels. Sales volume in the consumer distribution channel decreased 10.6%
for the quarterly period and 13.8% for the twenty-six week period. These decreases were caused in
large part to the loss of private label business in the latter part of fiscal 2005 with customers
that would not accept price increases. Also, market studies have shown a shift in consumer
preference to branded snack nuts away from private label as the price differential between branded
and private label products has narrowed. Market studies have also shown a decrease in overall nut
category volume sales during the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2006. Unit sales volume of the
Company s Fisher brand increased 7.4% and 2.9% for the quarterly and twenty-six periods; however,
since the majority of the Company s consumer distribution channel business is private label, the
overall decrease in the consumer distribution channel was significant. Unit sales volume in the
industrial distribution channel decreased 22.4% for the quarterly period and 13.7% for the
twenty-six week period. These decreases were due primarily to decreased demand due to the higher
costs of tree nuts and the loss of certain business at major customers.

Unit volume sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2006, when compared to the first quarter of
fiscal 2005, also decreased in the Company s food service (4.3%), export (7.1%) and contract
packaging (2.2%) distribution channels. Unit volume sales for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal
2006, when compared to the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2005, decreased in the Company s food
service (5.4%) and export (6.1%) distribution channels. These decreases, for both the quarterly and
twenty-six week periods, were caused largely by reduced demand due to higher selling prices
resulting from the significantly higher costs of tree nuts. The food service decreases were also
partially attributable to lower airline customer sales.

The following table shows a comparison of sales by distribution channel, and as a percentage of
total net sales (dollars in thousands):

The following summarizes sales by product type as a percentage of total gross sales. The
information is based on gross sales, rather than net sales, because certain adjustments, such as
promotional discounts, are not allocable to product type.

Gross Profit   
Gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 decreased 35.4% to $16.1 million from $25.0
million for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Gross margin decreased to 8.4% of net sales for the
second quarter of fiscal 2006 from 13.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Gross profit for
the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2006 decreased 29.8% to $29.4 million from $41.9 million for
the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2005. Gross margin decreased to 8.9% of net sales for the
first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2006 from 13.2% for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2005.

The decrease in gross margin for the quarterly period was caused by two main factors of roughly
equal significance: (i) a decrease in production, and (ii) the rising costs of tree nuts. The
decreases in sales volume led to a corresponding decrease in production. Also, production further
decreased due to a concerted effort to reduce finished goods inventory levels and to reduced levels
of pecan shelling since the pecan crop was harvested later in the year during fiscal 2006 than in
fiscal 2005. Manufacturing expenses of a fixed nature did not decrease with the decrease in
production. The higher costs of tree nuts also negatively affected gross margin. The rising costs
of almonds continued to negatively impact the Company s profitability. The Company recorded a $2.2
million reserve during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 for losses expected on the fulfillment of
certain fixed price almond contracts entered into in fiscal 2005. The majority of the balances on
these contracts were shipped during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and resulted in zero gross
profit. A reserve of $0.9 million remains at December 29, 2005 for fixed price almond contracts,
the majority of which will be fulfilled in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The shift in sales mix
from the

15

Table of Contents   

consumer distribution channel also negatively affected gross margin, as consumer sales
typically carry higher gross margins than the Company s overall gross margin.

The decrease in gross margin for the twenty-six week period was generally caused by the same
factors that negatively affected gross margin for the quarterly period. Other factors experienced
during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 also affected gross margin for the twenty-six week period.
Favorably impacting gross margin for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2006 compared to the
first quarter of fiscal 2005 was a $0.3 million almond grower liability increase for the final 2004
crop settlement recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to a $1.2 million increase
for the final 2003 crop settlement recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Almond processing
costs were negatively impacted by the lower quality of purchased almonds used in production. The
gross margins on pecan sales were also lower in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 than the first
quarter of fiscal 2005 due to significantly higher pecan costs.

Selling and Administrative Expenses   
Selling and administrative expenses increased to $14.9 million, or 7.8% of net sales, for the
second quarter of fiscal 2006 from $14.2 million, or 7.7% of net sales, for the second quarter of
fiscal 2005. Selling expenses increased slightly to $11.1 million, or 5.8% of net sales, for the
second quarter of fiscal 2006 from $10.9 million, or 6.0% of net sales, for the first quarter of
fiscal 2005. Administrative expenses increased to $3.7 million, or 2.0% of net sales, for the
second quarter of fiscal 2006 from $3.3 million, or 1.8% of net sales, for the second quarter of
fiscal 2005. This increase was due primarily to a $0.5 million of expenses related to a
supplemental retirement plan adopted in August 2005.

Selling and administrative expenses increased to $28.2 million, or 8.6% of net sales, for the first
twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2006 from $26.8 million, or 8.4% of net sales, for the first twenty-six
weeks of fiscal 2005. Selling expenses increased slightly to $21.0 million, or 6.4% of net sales,
for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2006 from $20.8 million, or 6.5% of net sales, for the
first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2005. Administrative expenses increased to $7.2 million, or 2.2%
of net sales, for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2006 from $6.0 million, or 1.9% of net
sales, for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2005. This increase was due primarily to a $0.7
million of expenses related to a supplemental retirement plan adopted in August 2005 and to a $0.3
million increase in legal and audit expenses.

Income from Operations   
Due to the factors discussed above, income from operations decreased to $1.3 million, or 0.7% of
net sales, for the second quarter of fiscal 2006, from approximately $10.8 million, or 5.9% of net
sales, for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Income from operations decreased to $1.2 million, or
0.4% of net sales, for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2006, from approximately $15.1 million,
or 4.8% of net sales, for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2005.

Interest Expense   
Interest expense increased to $1.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 from $0.4 million
for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Interest expense increased to $2.7 million for the first
twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2006 from $0.7 million for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2005.
These increases were caused by higher average levels of borrowings and a higher interest rate on
the Company s revolving bank credit facility.

Rental and Miscellaneous (Expense) Income, Net   
Net rental and miscellaneous (expense) income was an expense of $0.1 million for the second quarter
of fiscal 2006 compared to income of $0.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Net rental
and miscellaneous (expense) income was an expense of $0.3 million for the first twenty-six weeks of
fiscal 2006 compared to income of $0.3 million for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2005. The
decreases of $0.2 million for the quarterly period and $0.6 million for the twenty-six week period
were caused by expenses at the office building at the Current Site, including depreciation,
exceeding rental income.

Income Taxes   
Income tax expense was $0.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to $4.1 million,
or 39.0% of income before income taxes, for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Income tax expense
was recorded for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 despite a slight loss before income taxes due to
the inclusion of non-deductible stock option expense. Income tax benefit was $0.6 million, or 32.0%
of loss before income taxes, for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2006 compared to $5.7 million
of income tax expense, or 39.0% of income before income taxes, for the second quarter of fiscal
2005.

Net (Loss) Income   
Net loss was ($0.1) million, or ($0.01) per common share (basic and diluted), for the second
quarter of fiscal 2006, compared to net income of $6.4 million, or $0.61 basic per common share
($0.60 diluted), for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Net loss was ($1.2) million, or ($0.11)
per common share (basic and diluted), for the first twenty-six

16

Table of Contents   

weeks of fiscal 2006, compared to
net income of $9.0 million, or $0.85 basic per common share ($0.84 diluted), for the first
twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2005.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

General   
The primary uses of cash are to fund the Company s current operations, including its facility
consolidation project, fulfill contractual obligations and repay indebtedness. Also, various
uncertainties could result in additional uses of cash, such as those described below under  Factors
That May Affect Future Results .

Cash flows from operating activities have historically been driven by net income but are also
significantly influenced by inventory requirements, which can change based upon fluctuations in
both quantities and market prices of the various nuts the Company sells. Current market trends in
nut prices and crop estimates also impact nut procurement.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $48.7 million for the first twenty-six weeks of
fiscal 2006 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $11.3 million for the first
twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2005. The increase is due to a $51.0 million decrease in inventory
purchases, primarily in pecans, peanuts and cashews. Pecan purchases decreased due to a 25.4%
decrease in the average cost of inshell pecans along with a 23.4% decrease in the quantity
purchased. The decrease in the quantity of inshell pecan purchases is due to a timing difference in
procuring the inshell pecans in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, with a greater portion of the
inshell pecan purchases occurring in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. Peanut purchases decreased
due to a change in the manner that peanuts are procured. Cashew purchases decreased due to
sufficient quantities already on hand in inventories at the beginning of the period. Overall nut
purchases for the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2006 compared to the first twenty-six weeks of
fiscal 2005 decreased by 29.8% in terms of pounds, and 20.0% in terms of dollars.

The Company repaid $0.4 million of long-term debt during the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2006
compared to $0.6 million during the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2005.

Financing Arrangements   
The Company s bank credit facility (the  Bank Credit Facility ) is comprised of (i) a working
capital revolving loan which provides working capital financing of up to $93.6 million (as amended
in February 2006) in the aggregate, and matures, as amended, on May 31, 2006, and (ii) a $6.4
million letter of credit (the  IDB Letter of Credit ) to secure the industrial development bonds
described below which matures on June 1, 2006. The Bank Credit Facility was amended on February 2,
2006 to temporarily increase the total availability under the facility by $20.0 million and waive
the Company s non-compliance with two financial covenants, as is described below. Borrowings under
the working capital revolving loan accrue interest at a rate (the weighted average of which was
7.14% at December 29, 2005) determined pursuant to a formula based on the agent bank s quoted rate
and the Eurodollar Interbank rate. As of December 29, 2005 the Company had $43.1 million of
available credit under the Bank Credit Facility.

The Bank Credit Facility, as amended, matures on May 31, 2006 and includes certain restrictive
covenants that, among other things: (i) require the Company to maintain specified financial ratios;
(ii) limit the Company s annual capital expenditures; and (iii) require that Jasper B. Sanfilippo
(the Company s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer) and Mathias A. Valentine (a
director and the Company s former President) together with their respective immediate family
members and certain trusts created for the benefit of their respective sons and daughters, continue
to own shares representing the right to elect a majority of the directors of the Company. In
addition, the Bank Credit Facility limits dividends to the lesser of (a) 25% of net income for the
previous fiscal year, or (b) $5.0 million, and prohibits the Company from redeeming shares of
capital stock.

On December 16, 2004, the Company received $65.0 million pursuant to a note purchase agreement (the
 Note Agreement ) with various lenders to fund a portion of the facility consolidation project and
for general working capital purposes. Under the terms of the Note Agreement, the notes have a
maturity of ten years, bear interest at a 4.67% annual rate and are required to be repaid in equal
semi-annual principal payments of $3.6 million beginning on June 1, 2006. As of December 29, 2005,
the outstanding balance on the Note Agreement was $65.0 million.

The Company was not in compliance with the funded debt to twelve-month EBITDA ratio covenants under
the Bank Credit Facility and the Note Agreement and the minimum twelve-month EBITDA requirement
under the Bank Credit Facility as of December 29, 2005. The Company received waivers not to demand
payment of amounts outstanding under these agreements for non-compliance with these three financial
covenants as of December 29, 2005. However, the Company expects to be in non-compliance with these
same three covenants for the quarter ending March 30, 2006. Accordingly, $57.8 million of long-term
was reclassified as a current liability. In addition to the waivers, the Bank Credit Facility was
amended to provide an additional $20.0 million of availability and the Note

17

Table of Contents   

Agreement was amended
whereby an additional fee of 1.00% per annum will be incurred by the Company for the time period
for which compliance with the funded debt to twelve-month EBITDA ratio is not obtained.
Non-compliance with financial covenants constitutes an event of default as defined in the financing
agreements. Upon an event of default, outstanding amounts, including accrued interest, under the
financing facilities would become immediately due at the demand of the lender. While the Company
fully expects to renegotiate the terms of the Bank Credit Facility and the Note Agreement during
the third quarter of fiscal 2006, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to
successfully renegotiate these financing agreements with its lenders or that the terms of the
credit agreements will not be substantially changed. If the Bank Credit Facility is not renewed,
the Company believes that it will be able to secure necessary financing from other lenders who have
expressed interest in negotiating with the Company. If the Company is not able to renegotiate the
terms of its credit agreements, it will have to consider financing alternatives which might include
identifying alternative sources of debt or equity capital, or an unplanned sale of assets or the
curtailment of the facility consolidation project. The inability of the Company to renegotiate the
terms of its existing credit facilities or obtain new financing could have a material adverse
effect on the Company s business and financial position.

As of December 29, 2005, the Company had $6.2 million in aggregate principal amount of industrial
development bonds outstanding, which was originally used to finance the acquisition, construction
and equipping of the Company s Bainbridge, Georgia facility. The bonds bear interest payable
semiannually at 4.00% (which was reset on June 1, 2002) through May 2006. On June 1, 2006, and on
each subsequent interest reset date for the bonds, the Company is required to redeem the bonds at
face value plus any accrued and unpaid interest, unless a bondholder elects to retain his or her
bonds. Any bonds redeemed by the Company at the demand of a bondholder on the reset date are
required to be remarketed by the underwriter of the bonds on a  best efforts  basis. Funds for the
redemption of bonds on the demand of any bondholder are required to be obtained from the following
sources in the following order of priority: (i) funds supplied by the Company for redemption; (ii)
proceeds from the remarketing of the bonds; (iii) proceeds from a drawing under the IDB Letter of
Credit; or (iv) in the event funds from the foregoing sources are insufficient, a mandatory payment
by the Company. Drawings under the IDB Letter of Credit to redeem bonds on the demand of any
bondholder are payable in full by the Company upon demand of the lenders under the Bank Credit
Facility. In addition, the Company is required to redeem the bonds in varying annual installments,
ranging from $0.3 million in fiscal 2006 to $0.8 million in fiscal 2017. The Company is also
required to redeem the bonds in certain other circumstances; for example, within 180 days after any
determination that interest on the bonds is taxable. The Company has the option, subject to
certain conditions, to redeem the bonds at face value plus accrued interest, if any.

Capital Expenditures   
The Company spent $5.3 million on capital expenditures unrelated to the facility consolidation
project during the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2006 compared to $4.5 million during the first
twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2005. This increase is due primarily to $1.0 million spent to purchase
land adjacent to the Company s plant in Gustine, California. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2006
that are unrelated to the facility consolidation project are expected to be approximately $12
million. Capital expenditures related to the facility consolidation project were $12.2 million for
the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2006 compared to $2.3 million for the first twenty-six weeks
of fiscal 2005. Groundbreaking at the Current Site occurred in August 2005. The Company entered
into a contract with a general contractor for an estimated amount of $23.2 million, $9.1 million of
which was paid during the first twenty-six weeks of fiscal 2006, to construct the expansion of the
Current Site. This expansion is scheduled to be completed in the first half of calendar 2006. The
Company expects to incur an additional $30   $40 million on the facility consolidation project from
fiscal 2006 through completion, primarily related to the completion of the expansion to the Current
Site and the purchase of capital equipment. Groundbreaking at the Current Site occurred in August
2005.

The Company, along with related party partnerships that own a portion of the Company s existing
Chicago area facilities, is in the process of selling these facilities. The Company intends to
lease back from the ultimate purchasers that portion of the facilities that are necessary to run
the Company s business while the facility consolidation project is completed in Elgin. The Company
estimates that these sale and leaseback transactions will be consummated during the third quarter
of fiscal 2006. Based upon the bids received, the Company believes that proceeds received from the
sales will exceed the Company s carrying value of these assets. The Company s Board of Directors
appointed an independent board committee to explore alternatives with respect to the Company s
existing leases for the properties owned by the related party partnerships. After negotiations
with the partnerships, the independent committee approved a non-binding letter of intent whereby:
(i) the current related party leases would terminate without penalty to the Company; (ii) the
Company would receive $2.0 million for the portion of the Busse Road property that it owns; and
(iii) the Company will sell its Selma, Texas properties to the partnerships for $14.3 million (an
estimate of fair value and in excess of its carrying value) and lease them back. The sale price and
rental rate for the Selma, Texas properties were determined by an independent appraiser. The lease
for the Selma, Texas properties will have a ten-year term at a fair market value rent, with three
five-year renewal options. In addition, the Company will have an option to repurchase these
properties from the partnerships after five years at 95% of the then fair market value.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The statements contained in this filing that are not historical (including statements concerning
the Company s expectations regarding market risk) are  forward looking statements . These forward
looking statements, which generally are followed (and therefore identified) by a cross reference to
 Factors That May Affect Future Results  or are identified by the use of forward looking words and
phrases such as  intends ,  may ,  believes  and  expects , represent the Company s present
expectations or beliefs concerning future events. The Company cautions that such statements are
qualified by important factors, including the factors described below under  Factors That May
Affect Future Results , that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the
forward looking statements, as well as the timing and occurrence (or nonoccurrence) of transactions
and events which may be subject to circumstances beyond the Company s control. Consequently,
results actually achieved may differ materially from the expected results included in these
statements.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS 

Availability of Raw Materials and Market Price Fluctuations   
The availability and cost of raw materials for the production of the Company s products, including
peanuts, pecans, almonds, walnuts and other nuts are subject to crop size and yield fluctuations
caused by factors beyond the Company s control, such as weather conditions, plant diseases and
changes in government programs. Additionally, the supply of edible nuts and other raw materials
used in the Company s products could be reduced upon any determination by the United States
Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) or other government agencies that certain pesticides, herbicides
or other chemicals used by growers have left harmful residues on portions of the crop or that the
crop has been contaminated by aflatoxin or other agents. If worldwide demand for nuts continues at
recent rates, and supply does not expand to meet demand, a reduction in availability and an
increase in the cost of raw materials would occur. This type of increase was experienced during the
last half of fiscal 2004 and during fiscal 2005 and the first quarter of fiscal 2006 for most of
the Company s major nut types. The Company is not able to hedge against changes in commodity prices
because no market to do so exists, and thus, shortages in the supply of and increases in the prices
of nuts and other raw materials used by the Company in its products (to the extent that cost
increases cannot be passed on to customers) could have an adverse impact on the Company s
profitability. Furthermore, fluctuations in the market prices of nuts may affect the value of the
Company s inventories and profitability. The Company has significant inventories of nuts that would
be adversely affected by any decrease in the market price of such raw materials. The Company is
currently committed to purchase 4.6 million pounds of almonds during the last half of fiscal 2006
at costs that are currently above the market price in the industrial distribution channel. However,
these almonds are expected to be sold at a profit, thus eliminating the need for any loss to be
recognized as of December 29, 2005. See  Introduction .

Competitive Environment   
The Company operates in a highly competitive environment. The Company s principal products compete
against food and snack products manufactured and sold by numerous regional and national companies,
some of which are substantially larger and have greater resources than the Company, such as
Planters and Ralcorp Holdings, Inc. The Company also competes with other shellers in the industrial
market and with regional processors in the retail and wholesale markets. In order to maintain or
increase its market share, the Company must continue to price its products competitively, which may
lower revenue per unit and cause declines in gross margin, if the Company is unable to increase
unit volumes as well as reduce its costs.

Dependence Upon Customers   
The Company is dependent on a few significant customers for a large portion of its total sales,
particularly in the consumer channel. Sales to the Company s five largest customers represented
approximately 38%, 39% and 37% of gross sales in fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003,
respectively. Wal-Mart alone accounted for approximately 18%, 19% and 17% of the Company s net
sales for fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. The loss of one of the Company s
largest customers, or a material decrease in purchases by one or more of its largest customers,
would result in decreased sales and adversely impact the Company s income and cash flow.

Pricing Pressures   
As the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and the Company s retail customers grow larger
and become more sophisticated, the Company s retail customers are demanding lower pricing and
increased promotional programs. Further, these customers may begin to place a greater emphasis on
the lowest-cost supplier in making purchasing decisions, particularly if buying techniques such as
reverse internet auctions increase in popularity. An increased focus on the lowest-cost supplier
could reduce the benefits of some of the Company s competitive advantages. The Company s sales
volume growth could slow, and it may become necessary to lower the Company s

19

Table of Contents   

prices and increase
promotional support of the Company s products, any of which would adversely affect its gross
profit.

Production Limitations   
The Company has experienced significant sales growth as its customer demand has increased. If the
Company continues to experience comparable increases in customer demand, particularly prior to the
completion of the Company s facility consolidation project, it may be unable to fully satisfy its
customers  supply needs. If the Company becomes unable to supply sufficient quantities of products,
it may lose sales and market share to its competitors.

Financing Agreements   
The Company s unfavorable operating results have caused non-compliance with certain restrictive
covenants under its financing facilities. Specifically, the Company failed to achieve the minimum
rolling twelve-month EBITDA requirement under the Bank Credit Facility and exceeded the maximum
allowable funded debt to twelve-month EBITDA ratio under both the Bank Credit Facility and the Note
Agreement. The Company received waivers not to demand payment of amounts outstanding under these
agreements for non-compliance with these three financial covenants as of December 29, 2005.
However, the Company expects to not be in compliance with these same three covenants for the
quarter ending March 30, 2006. Accordingly, $57.8 million of long-term was reclassified as a
current liability. In addition to the waivers, the Bank Credit Facility was amended to provide an
additional $20.0 million of availability and the Note Agreement was amended whereby an additional
fee of 1.00% per annum will be incurred by the Company for the time period for which compliance
with the funded debt to twelve-month EBITDA ratio is not obtained. Non-compliance with financial
covenants constitutes an event of default as defined in the financing agreements. Upon an event of
default, outstanding amounts, including accrued interest, under the financing facilities would
become immediately due at the demand of the lender. While the Company fully expects to renegotiate
the terms of the Bank Credit Facility and the Note Agreement during the third quarter of fiscal
2006, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully renegotiate these
financing agreements with its lenders or that the terms of the credit agreements will not be
substantially changed. If the Bank Credit Facility is not renewed, the Company believes that it
will be able to secure necessary financing from other lenders who have expressed interest in
negotiating with the Company. If the Company is not able to renegotiate the terms of its credit
agreements, it will have to consider financing alternatives which might include identifying
alternative sources of debt or equity capital, or an unplanned sale of assets or the curtailment of
the facility consolidation project. The inability of the Company to renegotiate the terms of its
existing credit facilities or obtain new financing could have a material adverse effect on the
Company s business and financial position.

Food Safety and Product Contamination   
The Company could be adversely affected if consumers in the Company s principal markets lose
confidence in the safety of nut products, particularly with respect to peanut and tree nut
allergies. Individuals with peanut allergies may be at risk of serious illness or death resulting
from the consumption of the Company s nut products, including consumption of other companies 
products containing the Company s products as an ingredient. Notwithstanding existing food safety
controls, the Company processes peanuts and tree nuts on the same equipment, and there is no
guarantee that the Company s peanut-free products will not be cross-contaminated by peanuts.
Concerns generated by risks of peanut and tree nut cross-contamination and other food safety
matters may discourage consumers from buying the Company s products, cause production and delivery
disruptions, or result in product recalls.

Product Liability and Product Recalls   
The Company faces risks associated with product liability claims and product recalls in the event
its food safety and quality control procedures fail and its products cause injury or become
adulterated or misbranded. In addition, the Company does not control the labeling of other
companies  products containing the Company s products as an ingredient. A product recall of a
sufficient quantity, or a significant product liability judgment against the Company, could cause
the Company s products to be unavailable for a period of time and could result in a loss of
consumer confidence in the Company s food products. These kinds of events, were they to occur,
would have a material adverse effect on demand for the Company s products and, consequently, the
Company s income and liquidity.

Retention of Key Personnel   
The Company s future success will be largely dependent on the personal efforts of its senior
operating management team, including Michael J. Valentine, the Company s Executive Vice President
Finance, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, Jeffrey T. Sanfilippo, the Company s Executive Vice
President Sales and Marketing, and Jasper B. Sanfilippo, Jr., the Company s Executive Vice
President of Operations, which has assumed management of the day-to-day operation of the Company s
business over the past two years. In addition, the Company s success depends on the talents of
Everardo Soria, Senior Vice President Pecan Operations and Procurement, Walter R. Tankersley, Jr.,
Senior Vice President Industrial Sales, Charles M. Nicketta, Senior Vice President of Manufacturing
and Michael G. Cannon, Senior Vice President of Corporate Operations. The Company believes that
the expertise and knowledge of these individuals in the industry, and in their respective fields,
is a critical factor to the Company s continued growth

20

Table of Contents   

and success. The Company has not entered
into an employment agreement with any of these individuals, nor does the Company have key officer
insurance coverage policies in effect. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could
have a material adverse effect on the Company s business and prospects if the Company were unable
to identify a suitable candidate to replace any such individual. The Company s success is also
dependent upon its ability to attract and retain additional qualified marketing, technical and
other personnel, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to do so.

Risks and Uncertainties Regarding Facility Consolidation Project   
The facility consolidation project may not result in significant cost savings or increases in
efficiency, or allow the Company to increase its production capabilities to meet expected increases
in customer demand. Moreover, the Company s expectations with respect to the financial impact of
the facility consolidation project are based on numerous estimates and assumptions, any or all of
which may differ from actual results. Such differences could substantially reduce the anticipated
benefit of the project.

More specifically, the following risks, among others, may limit the financial benefits of the
facility consolidation project:

delays and cost overruns in the construction of and equipment for the new facility are
possible and could offset other cost savings expected from the consolidation; 

the facility consolidation project is likely to have a negative impact on the Company s
earnings during the construction period and the time during which operations are transitioned
to the Current Site; 

the proceeds the Company receives from selling or renting its existing facilities may be
less than it expects, and the timing of the receipt of those proceeds may be later than the
Company has planned; 

the facility consolidation project may not eliminate as many redundant processes as the
Company presently anticipates; 

the Company may not realize the expected increase in demand for its products necessary to
justify additional production capacity created by the facility consolidation; 

the Company may have problems or unexpected costs in transferring equipment or obtaining
new equipment; 

the Company may not be able to transfer production from its existing facilities to the new
facility without a significant interruption in its business; 

moving the Company s facilities to a new location may cause attrition in its personnel at
levels that result in a significant interruption in its operations, and the Company expects
to incur additional annual compensation costs of approximately $300,000 to facilitate the
retention of certain of its key personnel while the facility consolidation project is in
process; 

the Company may be required to fund a portion of the facility consolidation project through
additional financing, which may be at rates less favorable than its current credit
facilities; 

the Company may be unable to refinance its Bank Credit Facility; 

the Company may be unable to obtain amendments or waivers for future non-compliance with
restrictive financial covenants under its credit facilities for the third quarter of fiscal
2006; 

the Company may not receive the anticipated rental income for the unused portion of the Current Site; and 

the Company may not be able to recover its investment in the Original Site. 

If for any reason the Company were to realize less than the expected benefits from the facility
consolidation project, its future income stream, cash flows and debt levels could be materially
adversely affected. In addition, the facility consolidation project is a long-term project and
unanticipated risks may develop as the project proceeds.

Government Regulation   
The Company is subject to extensive regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration,
the United States Department of Agriculture, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and
other state and local authorities in jurisdictions where its products are manufactured, processed
or sold. Among other things, these

21

Table of Contents   

regulations govern the manufacturing, importation, processing,
packaging, storage, distribution and labeling of the Company s products. The Company s
manufacturing and processing facilities and products are subject to periodic compliance inspections
by federal, state and local authorities. The Company is also subject to environmental regulations
governing the discharge of air emissions, water and food waste, and the generation, handling,
storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. Amendments to existing statutes
and regulations, adoption of new statutes and regulations, increased production at the Company s
existing facilities as well as its expansion into new operations and jurisdictions, may require the
Company to obtain additional licenses and permits and could require it to adapt or alter methods of
operations at costs that could be substantial. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations may
adversely affect the Company s business. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations
could subject the Company to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as
well as possible criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s
business.

Economic, Political and Social Risks of Doing Business in Emerging Markets   
The Company purchases a substantial portion of its cashew inventories from India, Brazil and
Vietnam, which are in many respects emerging markets. To this extent, the Company is exposed to
risks inherent in emerging markets, including:

increased governmental ownership and regulation of the economy; 

greater likelihood of inflation and adverse economic conditions stemming from governmental
attempts to reduce inflation, such as imposition of higher interest rates and wage and price
controls; 

potential for contractual defaults or forced renegotiations
on purchase contracts with limited legal recourse; 

tariffs and other barriers to trade that may reduce the Company s profitability; and 

civil unrest and significant political instability. 

The existence of these risks in these and other foreign countries that are the origins of the
Company s raw materials could jeopardize or limit its ability to purchase sufficient supplies of
cashews and other imported raw materials and may adversely affect the Company s income by
increasing the costs of doing business overseas.

Fixed Price Commitments   
The great majority of the Company s industrial sales, and certain other customers, require the
Company to enter into fixed price commitments with its customers. Such commitments represented
approximately 28% of the Company s annual net sales in fiscal 2005, and in many cases are entered
into after the Company s cost to acquire the nut products necessary to satisfy the fixed price
commitment is substantially fixed. The commitments are for a fixed period of time, typically one
year, but may be extended if remaining balances exist. The Company expects to continue to enter
into fixed price commitments with respect to certain of its nut products prior to fixing its
acquisition cost in order to maintain customer relationships or when, in management s judgment,
market or crop harvest conditions so warrant. To the extent the Company does so, however, these
fixed price commitments may result in reduced gross profit margins or generate losses that have a
material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations.

Inventory Measurement   
The Company purchases its nut inventories from growers and farmers in large quantities at harvest
times, which are primarily during the second and third quarters of the Company s fiscal year, and
receives nut shipments in bulk truckloads. The weights of these nuts are measured using truck
scales at the time of receipt, and inventories are recorded on the basis of those measurements. The
nuts are then stored in bulk in large warehouses to be shelled or processed throughout the year.
Bulk-stored nut inventories are relieved on the basis of continuous high-speed bulk weighing
systems as the nuts are shelled or processed or on the basis of calculations derived from the
weight of the shelled nuts that are produced. While the Company performs various procedures to
confirm the accuracy of its bulk-stored nut inventories, these inventories are estimates that must
be periodically adjusted to account for positive or negative variations, and such adjustments
directly affect earnings. The precise amount of the Company s bulk-stored nut inventories is not
known until the entire quantity of the particular nut is depleted, which may not necessarily occur
every year. Prior crop year inventories may still be on hand as the new crop year inventories are
purchased. There can be no assurance that such inventory quantity adjustments will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations in the future.

2002 Farm Bill   
The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (the  2002 Farm Bill ) terminated the federal
peanut quota program beginning with the 2002 crop year. The 2002 Farm Bill replaced the federal
peanut quota program with a

22

Table of Contents   

fixed payment system through the 2007 crop year that can be either
coupled or decoupled. A coupled system is tied to the actual amount of production, while a
decoupled system is not. The series of loans and subsidies established by the 2002 Farm Bill is
similar to the systems used for other crops such as grains and cotton. To compensate farmers for
the elimination of the peanut quota, the 2002 Farm Bill provides a buy-out at a specified rate for
each pound of peanuts that had been in that farmer s quota under the prior program. Additionally,
among other provisions, the Secretary of Agriculture may make certain counter-cyclical payments
whenever the Secretary believes that the effective price for peanuts is less than the target price.
The termination of the federal peanut quota program has reduced the Company s costs for peanuts,
beginning in fiscal 2003, and has resulted in a higher gross margin than the Company has
historically achieved. Although this margin is now similar to the Company s total gross profit
margin, the Company may be unable to maintain these higher gross profit margins on the sale of
peanuts, and the Company s business, financial position and results of operations would thus be
materially adversely affected  .  

Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002   
The events of September 11, 2001 reinforced the need to enhance the security of the United States.
Congress responded in part by passing the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and
Response Act of 2002 (the  Bioterrorism Act ). The Bioterrorism Act includes a number of provisions
to help guard against the threat of bioterrorism, including new authority for the Secretary of
Health and Human Services ( HHS ) to take action to protect the nation s food supply against the
threat of international contamination. The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ), as the food
regulatory arm of HHS, is responsible for developing and implementing these food safety measures,
which fall into four broad categories: (i) registration of food facilities, (ii) establishment and
maintenance of records regarding the sources and recipients of foods, (iii) prior notice to FDA of
imported food shipments and (iv) administrative detention of potentially affected foods. FDA has
issued rules in each of these categories, which rules generally took effect on December 12, 2003.
There can be no assurances that the effects of the Bioterrorism Act and the related rules,
including any potential disruption in the Company s supply of imported nuts, which represented
approximately 37% of the Company s total nut purchases in fiscal 2005, will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company s business, financial position or results of operations in the
future.

23

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

The Company is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and to commodity prices of raw
material purchases. The Company has not entered into any arrangements to hedge against changes in
market interest rates, commodity prices or foreign currency fluctuations.

The Company is unable to engage in hedging activity related to commodity prices, since there are no
established futures markets for nuts. Approximately 37% of nut purchases for fiscal 2005 were made
from foreign countries, and while these purchases were payable in U.S. dollars, the underlying
costs may fluctuate with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the currency in the
foreign country.

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on the Bank Credit Facility, its only variable rate
credit facility because the Company has not entered into any hedging instruments that fix the
floating rate. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in weighted-average interest rates would have had
an immaterial impact on the Company s net income and cash flows from operating activities.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a 15(e)) as of December 29, 2005. Based on such
evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that,
as of December 29, 2005, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
reasonable assurance level.

In connection with the evaluation by management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the quarter ended December 29, 2005
that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal
control over financial reporting.

Item 5   Other Information 

Termination Agreement  

On February 1, 2006, the Company, together with the Arthur/Busse Limited Partnership and 300 East
Touhy Avenue Limited Partnership, two related party partnerships, entered into a Termination
Agreement with the City of Elgin whereby the Development Agreement among such parties was
terminated and the City of Elgin became obligated to convey the property to the
Company and the partnerships within thirty days. Upon such conveyance by the City of Elgin, the
partnerships have agreed to transfer (by quit claim deed) their interests to the Company without
consideration. After the property is conveyed, this property will be marketed to potential buyers.

Amendment of Bank Credit Facility and Note Agreement  

On February 2, 2006, the Company agreed to amend its Bank Credit Facility by entering into the
Seventh Amendment to Credit Agreement by and among the Company, U.S. Bank, N.A. and LaSalle Bank,
N.A. This amendment was necessary because the Company failed to achieve the minimum rolling
twelve-month EBITDA requirement under the Bank Credit Facility, and exceeded the maximum allowable
funded debt to twelve-month EBITDA ratio under the Bank Credit Facility. The Company received a
waiver not to demand payment of amounts outstanding under this agreement for non-compliance with
these financial covenants as of December 29, 2005. In addition to the waiver, the amendment
provides the Company with an additional $20.0 million of availability under the Bank Credit
Facility

On February 6, 2006, the Company agreed to amend its Note Agreement related to the Company s $65
million senior notes by entering into a Limited Waiver and First Amendment to the Note Agreement
among the Company and each of the noteholders. This amendment was necessary because the Company
exceeded the maximum allowable funded debt to twelve-month EBITDA ratio under the Note Agreement.
The Company received a waiver from the noteholders not to demand payment of amounts outstanding
under this agreement for non-compliance with this financial covenant as of December 29, 2005. In
addition to the waiver, the Note Agreement was amended whereby an additional fee of 1.00% per annum
will be incurred by the Company for the time period for which compliance with the funded debt to
twelve-month EBITDA ratio is not obtained.

Non-compliance with financial covenants constitutes an event of default as defined in both the Bank
Credit Facility and the Note Agreement. Upon an event of default, outstanding amounts, including
accrued interest, under the financing facilities would become immediately due at the demand of the
lenders. While the Company fully expects to renegotiate the terms of the Bank Credit Facility and
the Note Agreement during the third quarter of fiscal 2006, there is no assurance that the Company
will be able to successfully renegotiate these financing agreements with its lenders or that the
terms of the credit agreements will not be substantially changed. If the Bank Credit Facility is
not renewed, the Company believes that it will be able to secure necessary financing from other
lenders who have expressed interest in negotiating with the Company. If the Company is not able to
renegotiate the terms of its credit agreements, it will have to consider financing alternatives
which might include identifying alternative sources of debt or equity capital, or an unplanned sale
of assets or the curtailment of the facility consolidation project. The inability of the Company to
renegotiate the terms of its existing credit facilities or obtain new financing could have a
material adverse effect on the Company s business and financial position.

LIMITED WAIVER 
and 
FIRST AMENDMENT 
 
Dated as of February 6, 2006 
 
to 
 
Note Purchase Agreement 
Dated as of December 16, 2004

Re: $65,000,000 4.67% Senior Notes 
Due December 1, 2014

LIMITED WAIVER  
 and  
 FIRST AMENDMENT TO NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT 

This Limited Waiver and First Amendment, dated as of February 6, 2006 (this
  Amendment  ), to the Note Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 16, 2004, is
between John B. Sanfilippo   Son, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the   Company  ),
and each of the institutions which is a signatory to this Amendment
(collectively, the   Noteholders  ).

Recitals: 

A. The Company and each of the Noteholders have heretofore entered into the
Note Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 16, 2004 (the
  Note Agreement  ).
The Company has heretofore issued the $65,000,000 4.67% Senior Notes Due
December 1, 2014 (the   Notes  ) pursuant to the Note Agreement.

B. The Company has advised the Noteholders that an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing under Section 11(c) of the Note Agreement as a
result of the default by the Company in the compliance with the provisions of
Section 10.1(b) of the Note Agreement as of the end of the Fiscal Quarter ended
December 29, 2005 (the   Existing Default  ). The Company has requested that the
Noteholders waive the Existing Default as of December 29, 2005.

C. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, and effective as provided
herein, the Noteholders are willing to waive the Existing Default provided that
the Company agrees to certain amendments to the Note Agreement as provided
herein.

D. The Company and the Noteholders desire to amend the Note Agreement as
provided herein.

E. All requirements of law have been fully complied with and all other acts
and things necessary to make this Amendment a valid, legal and binding
instrument according to its terms for the purposes herein expressed have been
done or performed.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of good and valuable consideration the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company and the
Noteholders do hereby agree as follows:

SECTION 1. AMENDMENTS. 

1.1.  The following new Section 8.7 is added to the Note Agreement:

Section
8.7. Excess Leverage Fee.  In addition to interest accruing on
the Notes, the Company hereby agrees to pay to the holder of each Note a
fee (the   Excess Leverage Fee  ) at the rate of 1.00% per annum on the
outstanding principal balance of the Notes during any Fiscal Quarter ending
after December 29, 2005 if the Leverage Ratio as of the end of such Fiscal
Quarter is in excess of 3.50 to 1.00. The Excess Leverage Fee with respect
to each Note for any Fiscal Quarter shall be calculated on the same basis
as interest on such Note

is calculated and shall be paid in arrears on the next date after the end of
such Fiscal Quarter on which interest is payable on the Notes. The payment of
any Excess Leverage Fee shall not constitute a waiver of any Default or Event of
Default. If an Excess Leverage Fee is due for any Fiscal Quarter, the Company
will notify the holders of that fact as soon as reasonably possible and in any
event no later than 5 Business Days prior to the interest payment date on which
the payment of such Excess Leverage Fee is due. 

1.2.  Section 10.1 of the Note Agreement is amended to add the following new
subsections (d) and (e) thereto, such subsections to read as follows:

(d)  Minimum
EBITDA . The Company will not permit EBITDA for the period
of the four consecutive Fiscal Quarters ending with any Fiscal Quarter
ending after December 29, 2005 to be less than $30,000,000.

(e)
 Minimum Working Capital . The Company will not permit Working
Capital at the end of any month ending after December 29, 2005 to be less
than $50,000,000. 

1.3. 
The following is added to the end of Section 10.5(j) of the Note
Agreement:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company create, incur,
assume or permit to exist, or permit any of its Subsidiaries to create, incur,
assume or permit to exist, any Lien securing any Debt under the Credit Agreement
or any other working capital credit facility unless the Notes are secured on a
pari passu basis by Liens in all property securing such Debt pursuant to
documentation in form and substance satisfactory to the Required Holders in
their sole discretion, provided that the holders of the Notes and the holders of
such Debt shall have entered into an Intercreditor and Collateral Agency
Agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Required Holders in their
sole discretion, and such Intercreditor and Collateral Agency Agreement shall be
in full force and effect. 

1.4.  The following new Section 10.9 is added to the Note Agreement:

Section 10.9. Most Favored Lender Status. The Company will not, and
will not permit any Subsidiary to, enter into, assume or otherwise become
bound or obligated under the Credit Agreement or any agreement evidencing,
securing, guaranteeing or otherwise relating to Debt under the Credit
Agreement or any other working capital credit facility that contains, or
amend the Credit Agreement or any such agreement to contain, one or more
Additional Covenants or Additional Defaults, unless the Company or such
Subsidiary has offered to make an amendment this Agreement, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Required Holders, to add to or amend this
Agreement to contain such Additional Covenants or Additional Defaults;
 provided ,  however , in the event that the Company or any Subsidiary enters
into, assumes or otherwise becomes bound or obligated under, or so amends,
the Credit Agreement or any such agreement without making such

2

offer, or if such offer was made and has not been rejected by the Required
Holders, this Agreement shall, without any further action on the part of the
Company, or any of the holders, be deemed to be amended automatically to include
each Additional Covenant and each Additional Default contained in such
agreement. The Company further covenants to, and to cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, promptly execute and deliver at its expense (including the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the holders) an amendment to this
Agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Required Holders evidencing
the amendments of this Agreement to include such Additional Covenants and
Additional Defaults;  provided  that the execution and delivery of such
amendments shall not be a precondition to the effectiveness of such amendment as
provided for in this Section 10.9, but shall merely be for the convenience of
the parties hereto. 

1.5.  Section 11(b) of the Note Agreement is amended and
restated in its entirety to read as follows:

(b) the Company defaults in the payment of any interest or Excess Leverage Fee with respect to any Note for more
than five Business Days after the same becomes due and payable; or 

1.6.  The following shall be added as new definitions to Schedule B to the Note Agreement
in proper alphabetical order:

either (i) is similar to any Default or Event of Default contained in Section 11
of this Agreement, or related definitions in Schedule B to this Agreement, but
contains one or more percentages, amounts or formulas that is more restrictive
or has a shorter grace period than those set forth therein or is more beneficial
to any holder of any Debt under the Credit Agreement or any other working
capital facility (and

3

such provision shall be deemed an Additional Default only to the extent that it

is different from the subject matter of any Default or Event of Default
contained in Section 11 of this Agreement or related definitions in Schedule B
to this Agreement.

SEVENTH AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT  

This
Seventh Amendment (  Amendment  ) is made as of the February 2, 2006 to the Credit
Agreement dated as of March 31, 1998 (as amended, supplemented, restated or otherwise modified and
in effect from time to time, the   Credit Agreement ),  by and among JOHN B. SANFILIPPO   SON, INC.,
a Delaware corporation (and successor in interest to Sunshine Nut Co., Inc. and Quantz Acquisition
Co., Inc.,   Sanfilippo   or the   Borrower  ), and JBS INTERNATIONAL, INC., a Barbados corporation
which has been dissolved prior to the date of this Amendment (  JBS  ), the financial institutions
party thereto (collectively   Lenders   and
individually a   Lender  ) and U.S. BANK NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION, a national banking association, in its capacity as successor Agent for the Lenders to
U.S. Bancorp Ag Credit, Inc., a Colorado corporation (the   Agent  ).

RECITAL 

Except as defined herein, all capitalized terms used in this Amendment shall have
meaning assigned to them in the Credit Agreement.

Sun
Trust Bank, N.A.(  Sun Trust  ) has declined to continue as a Lender under the Credit
Agreement as amended by this Amendment. U.S. Bank and LaSalle Bank National Association
(  LaSalle  ) have agreed to continue as Lenders under the Credit Agreement as amended by this
Amendment. Sun Trust will be paid in full and shall have no further obligations under the Credit
Agreement on the date of this Amendment.

Borrower has requested certain waivers of the terms of the Credit Agreement and has requested
to borrow increased sums under the Credit Agreement, and the Agent and the Lenders have agreed to
such waivers and amendments upon the terms and conditions contained herein.

NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration of the foregoing and of the terms and conditions contained in
the Credit Agreement and this Amendment, and of any loans or extensions of credit or other
financial accommodations at any time made to or for the benefit of the Borrower by Lenders, the
Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders agree as follows:

1. The following definitions as set forth in  Section 1.1  of the Credit Agreement,

thereafter as set forth opposite such Lender s name under the heading  Loan
Commitments  on  Exhibit 1A-4,  as such amount may be reduced or terminated
from time to time pursuant to  Section 4.4 or 11.1,  and
   Loan
Commitments    shall mean, collectively, the Loan Commitments for all the
Lenders.

Page 1 of 7

2. The Notes referred to in Subsection (h) of  Section 2.1  of the Credit
Agreement,   Loans,   shall be in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit 2A-4. 

3. Payments of principal, interest, non-use fees and letter of credit fees by Borrower
and Equalization Transfers between the Lenders, shall be made on the date of this Amendment:
(i) to cause the payment in full of Sun Trust under the Credit Agreement (including the
payment of all interest, non-use fees and letter of credit fees to said date), (ii) to cause the
payment of interest, non-use fees and letter of credit fees to said date to the U.S. Bank and LaSalle
under the Credit Agreement; and (iii) to cause the Loans to be held by U.S. Bank and LaSalle according
to their respective Pro Rata Percentages as set forth in this Amendment. Borrower acknowledges
that, as a result of payment in full of Sun Trust pursuant to this Amendment, Borrower may
have reimbursement obligations under  Section 5.3  of the Credit Agreement. LaSalle
acknowledges that it may hold a greater percentage in existing LIBOR Rate Loans in the amount of its new
Pro Rata Percentage.

4. In addition to the fees owed by Borrower to the Agent and the Lenders pursuant
to  Section 6  of the Credit Agreement, Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent, for
distribution to the Lenders, a fee of $25,000 for the temporary increase of the Loan Commitment as provided for
herein (based on their respective pro rata share of the $20,000,000 temporary increase). Such
