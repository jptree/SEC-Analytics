Note
      A-Basis of Presentation  

The
      accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been
      prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for
      interim financial information and with instructions to Form 10-Q and Article
      10
      of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information
      and
      footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete
      financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, including
      normal recurring accruals, considered necessary for a fair presentation have
      been included. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial
      statements and footnotes included in the 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders
      for
      AutoZone, Inc. ( AutoZone  or the  Company ), which is incorporated by reference
      in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 27, 2005.

Operating
      results for the twelve and twenty-four weeks ended February 11, 2006, are not
      necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year
      ending August 26, 2006. Each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year
      consists of 12 weeks, and the fourth quarter consists of 16 or 17 weeks. Each
      of
      the fourth quarters of fiscal 2005 and 2006 has 16 weeks. Additionally, the
      Company s business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales
      generally occurring in the summer months of June through August and the lowest
      sales generally occurring in the winter months of December through
      February. 

Note
      B-Share-Based Payments  

Effective
      August 28, 2005, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      ( SFAS ) No. 123(R)  Share-Based Payment  and began recognizing compensation
      expense for its share-based payments based on the fair value of the awards.
      Share-based payments include stock option grants and certain transactions under
      the Company s other stock plans. SFAS 123(R) requires share-based compensation
      expense recognized since August 28, 2005, to be based on the following: a)
      grant
      date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS
      123
      for unvested options granted prior to the adoption date; b) grant date fair
      value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R) for unvested
      options granted subsequent to the adoption date; and c) the discount on shares
      sold to employees post-adoption, which represents the difference between the
      grant date fair value and the employee purchase price. Prior to August 28,
      2005,
      the Company accounted for share-based payments using the intrinsic-value-based
      recognition method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion ( APB ) No.
      25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,  and SFAS 123,  Accounting for
      Stock-Based Compensation.  As options were granted at an exercise price equal to
      the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, no
      stock-based employee compensation cost was reflected in net income prior to
      adopting SFAS 123(R). As the Company adopted SFAS 123(R) under the
      modified-prospective-transition method, results from prior periods have not
      been
      restated. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings
      per share if the Company had not adopted SFAS 123(R) and applied the fair value
      recognition provisions of Statement 123 to options granted under the Company s
      stock plans in all periods presented. For purposes of this pro forma disclosure,
      the value of the options is estimated using Black-Scholes-Merton multiple option
      pricing model for all option grants.

          to Table of
          Contents   

Under
      SFAS 123(R) forfeitures are estimated at the time of valuation and reduce
      expense ratably over the vesting period. This estimate is adjusted periodically
      based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to
      differ, from the previous estimate. Under SFAS 123 and APB 25, the Company
      elected to account for forfeitures when awards were actually forfeited, at
      which
      time all previous proforma expense (which after-tax, approximated $1.0 million
      in the twelve-week period and $3.2 million in the twenty-four week period ended
      February 11, 2006 and $0.5 million in the twelve week period and $0.7 million
      in
      the twenty-four week period ended February 12, 2005) was reversed to reduce
      pro
      forma expense for that period. 

The
      adoption of SFAS 123(R) s fair value method has resulted in additional
      share-based expense (a component of operating, selling and general and
      administrative expenses) in the amount of $4.0 million related to stock options
      and $265,000 related to share purchase plans for the twelve-week period ended
      February 11, 2006, than if the Company had continued to account for share-based
      compensation under APB 25. For the twelve-week period ended February 11,
      2006, this additional share-based compensation lowered pre-tax earnings by
      $4.2 million, lowered net income by $2.7 million, and lowered basic and diluted
      earnings per share by $0.03.  

For
      the
      twenty-four week period ended February 11, 2006,  the
      adoption of SFAS 123(R)'s fair value method has resulted in additional
      share-based expense in the amount of $7.5 million related to stock options
      and
      $441,000 related to share purchase plans, than if the company had continued
      to
      account for share-based composition under APB25.  This additional
      share-based compensation lowered pre-tax earnings by $8.0 million, lowered
      net
      income by $5.0 million, and lowered basic and diluted earnings per share by
      $0.07. SFAS 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of
      recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather
      than as an operating cash flow as required prior to SFAS 123(R). For the
      twenty-four week period ended February 11, 2006, the $6.4 million excess tax
      benefit classified as a financing cash inflow would have been classified as
      an
      operating cash inflow if the Company had not adopted SFAS 123(R). The impact
      of
      adopting SFAS 123(R) on future results will depend on, among other things,
      levels of share-based payments granted in the future, actual forfeiture rates
      and the timing of option exercises. 

AutoZone
      grants options to purchase common stock to some of its employees and directors
      under various plans at prices equal to the market value of the stock on the
      dates the options were granted. The options have a term of 10 years from grant
      date and vest three years from grant date for director options and in equal
      annual installments over the four-year period following the grant date for
      employee options. Employees have 30 days after the employment relationship
      ends
      to exercise all vested options. The fair value of each option grant is
      separately estimated for each vesting date. The fair value of each option is
      amortized into compensation expense on a straight-line basis between the grant
      date for the award and each vesting date. The Company has estimated the fair
      value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by applying the
      Black-Scholes-Merton multiple-option pricing valuation model. The application
      of
      this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly
      sensitive in the determination of compensation expense. The weighted average
      for
      key assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted in the
      twenty-four-week period ended February 11, 2006 and a summary of the methodology
      applied to develop each assumption are as follows:

                  interest rate

Expected
      Price Volatility -   
      This is
      a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to
      fluctuate. We use actual historical changes in the market value of our stock
      to
      calculate the volatility assumption as it is management s belief that this is
      the best indicator of future volatility. We calculate daily market value changes
      from the date of grant over a past period representative of the expected life
      of
      the options to determine volatility. An increase in the expected volatility
      will
      increase compensation expense.  

Risk-Free
      Interest Rate -   
      This is
      the U.S. Treasury rate for the week of the grant having a term equal to the
      expected life of the option. An increase in the risk-free interest rate will
      increase compensation expense.  

Expected
      Lives -   
      This is
      the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain
      outstanding and is based on historical experience. Separate groups of employees
      that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for
      valuation purposes. Options granted have a maximum term of ten years. An
      increase in the expected life will increase compensation expense.  

Forfeiture
      Rate -   
      This is
      the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited
      or
      canceled before becoming fully vested. This estimate is based on historical
      experience. An increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation
      expense.  

Dividend
      Yield -   
      The
      Company has not made any dividend payments nor does it have plans to pay
      dividends in the foreseeable future. An increase in the dividend yield will
      decrease compensation expense.

The
      Company generally issues new shares when options are exercised. A summary of
      stock option activity since our most recent fiscal year end is as follows:

At
      February 11, 2006, the aggregate intrinsic value of all outstanding options
      was
      $104.2 million with a weighted average remaining contractual term of 7.2 years,
      of which 1,662,137 of the outstanding options are currently exercisable with
      an
      aggregate intrinsic value of $68.5 million, a weighted average exercise price
      of
      $56.82 and a weighted average remaining contractual term of 5.8 years. Shares
      reserved for future option grants approximated 2.2 million at February 11,
      2006.
      Since August 27, 2005, the weighted average grant date fair value of options
      granted is $22.66 and 882,231 options have vested, net of forfeitures, with
      a
      weighted average intrinsic value of $33.92. At February 11, 2006, the total
      compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized was $25.9
      million with a weighted average expense recognition period of 2.0
      years. 

Under
      the
      AutoZone, Inc. 2003 Director Stock Option Plan, on January 1 of each year,
      each
      non-employee director receives an option to purchase 1,500 shares of common
      stock, and each non-employee director that owns common stock worth at least
      five
      times the annual fee paid to each non-employee director on an annual basis
      will
      receive an additional option to purchase 1,500 shares of common stock. In
      addition, each new director receives an option to purchase 3,000 shares upon
      election to the Board of Directors, plus a portion of the annual directors 
option grant prorated for the portion of the year actually served in office.
      These stock option grants are made at the fair market value as of the grant
      date. At February 11, 2006, there were 79,617 outstanding options under the
      current and prior plans with 315,883 shares of common stock reserved for future
      issuance under the current plan. 

Under
      the
      AutoZone, Inc. 2003 Director Compensation Plan, a non-employee director may
      receive no more than one-half of their director fees immediately in cash, and
      the remainder of the fees must be taken in common stock or may be deferred
      in
      units with value equivalent to the value of shares of common stock as of the
      grant date. At February 11, 2006, the Company has $1.7 million accrued related
      to 17,739 director units issued under the current and prior plans with 89,077
      shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under the current
      plan. 

The
      Company recognized $441,000 in expense related to the discount on the selling
      of
      shares to employees and executives under various share purchase plans. Under
      the
      Company s share purchase plans for the twenty-four week period ended February
      11, 2006, 26,925 shares were sold to employees and the Company repurchased,
      at
      fair value, 31,452 shares from employees electing to sell their stock. Issuances
      of shares under the share purchase plans are netted against repurchases and
      such
      repurchases are not included in share repurchases disclosed in  Note G - Stock
      Repurchase Program.  At February 11, 2006, 435,944 shares of common stock were
      reserved for future issuance under the employee plan and 264,390 shares of
      common stock were reserved for future issuance under the executive
      plan. 

There
      have been no modifications to the Company s share-based compensation plans
      during the twenty-four week period ended February 11, 2006.  

Note
      C- Inventories  

Inventories
      are stated at the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO )
      method. Included in inventory are related purchasing, storage and handling
      costs. Due to price deflation on the Company s merchandise purchases, the
      Company s inventory balances are effectively maintained under the first-in,
      first-out method as the Company s policy is not to write up inventory for
      favorable LIFO adjustments, resulting in cost of sales being reflected at the
      higher amount. The cumulative balance of this unrecorded adjustment, which
      would
      be reduced upon experiencing price inflation on our merchandise purchases,
      was
      $183 million at February 11, 2006, and $167 million at August 27,
      2005. 

AutoZone
      has entered into pay-on-scan ( POS ) arrangements with certain vendors, whereby
      AutoZone will not purchase merchandise supplied by a vendor until just before
      that merchandise is ultimately sold to AutoZone s customers. Title and certain
      risks of ownership remain with the vendor until the merchandise is sold to
      AutoZone s customers. Since the Company does not own merchandise under POS
      arrangements until just before it is sold to a customer, such merchandise is
      not
      recorded on the Company s balance sheet. Upon the sale of the merchandise to
      AutoZone s customers, AutoZone recognizes the liability for the goods and pays
      the vendor in accordance with the agreed-upon terms. Although AutoZone does
      not
      hold title to the goods, AutoZone controls pricing and has credit collection
      risk and therefore, gross revenues under POS arrangements are included in net
      sales in the income statement. AutoZone has financed the repurchase of existing
      merchandise inventory by certain vendors in order to convert such vendors to
      POS
      arrangements. These receivables have remaining durations up to 20 months and
      approximated $30.9 million at February 11, 2006, and $49.9 million at August
      27,
      2005. The current portion of these receivables is reflected in accounts
      receivable and was $27.9 million at February 11, 2006, and $37.5 million at
      August 27, 2005. The long-term portion of $3.0 million at February 11, 2006,
      and
      $12.4 million at August 27, 2005, is reflected as a component of other long-term
      assets. Merchandise under POS arrangements was $126.6 million at February 11,
      2006, and $151.7 million at August 27, 2005.

      D-Legal Proceedings  

AutoZone,
      Inc. is a defendant in a lawsuit entitled "Coalition for a Level Playing Field,
      L.L.C., et al., v. AutoZone, Inc. et al.," filed in the U.S. District Court
      for
      the Southern District of New York in October 2004. The case was filed by
      approximately 240 plaintiffs, which are principally automotive aftermarket
      warehouse distributors and jobbers (collectively  Plaintiffs ), against 24
      defendants, 11 of which are principally automotive aftermarket retailers (7
      of
      which are AutoZone related entities) and 13 of which are principally aftermarket
      manufacturers. One aftermarket retailer was subsequently dismissed. Of the
      aftermarket manufacturer defendants, 7 settled, were dismissed, or were
      improperly served, and 6 more aftermarket manufacturer defendants were added
      in
      an amended complaint filed in November 2005, leaving 12 aftermarket manufacturer
      defendants; for a current total of 22 remaining defendants ("Defendants").
      In
      the amended complaint the plaintiffs allege, inter alia, that some or all of
      the
      automotive aftermarket retailer defendants have knowingly received, in violation
      of the Robinson-Patman Act (the  Act ), from various of the aftermarket
      manufacturer defendants benefits such as volume discounts, rebates, early buy
      allowances and other allowances, fees, inventory without payment, sham
      advertising and promotional payments, a share in the manufacturers' profits,
      benefits of pay on scan purchases, implementation of radio frequency
      identification technology, and excessive payments for services purportedly
      performed for the manufacturers. Additionally, a subset of plaintiffs alleges
      a
      claim of fraud against the automotive aftermarket retailer defendants based
      on
      discovery issues in a prior litigation involving similar Robinson-Patman Act
      claims. In the prior litigation, the discovery dispute, as well as the
      underlying claims, were decided in favor of AutoZone and the other automotive
      aftermarket retailer defendants who proceeded to trial, pursuant to a unanimous
      jury verdict which was affirmed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. In
      the
      current litigation, plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of damages (including
      statutory trebling), attorneys' fees, and a permanent injunction prohibiting
      the
      aftermarket retailer defendants from inducing and/or knowingly receiving
      discriminatory prices from any of the aftermarket manufacturer defendants and
      from opening up any further stores to compete with plaintiffs as long as
      defendants allegedly continue to violate the Act. The Company believes this
      suit
      to be without merit and is vigorously defending against it. Defendants have
      filed motions to dismiss all claims with prejudice on substantive and procedural
      grounds. Additionally, the Defendants have sought to enjoin plaintiffs from
      filing similar lawsuits in the future. If granted in their entirety, these
      dispositive motions would resolve the litigation in Defendants'
      favor. 

On
      June 22, 2005, the Attorney General of the State of California, in conjunction
      with District Attorneys for San Bernardino, San Joaquin and Monterey Counties,
      filed suit in the San Bernardino County Superior Court against AutoZone, Inc.
      and its California subsidiaries. The San Diego County District Attorney later
      joined the suit. The lawsuit alleges that AutoZone failed to follow various
      state statutes and regulations governing the storage and handling of used motor
      oil and other materials collected for recycling or used for cleaning AutoZone
      stores and parking lots. The suit seeks $12.0 million in penalties and
      injunctive relief.  

The
      Company currently, and from time to time, is involved in various other legal
      proceedings incidental to the conduct of its business. Although the amount
      of
      liability that may result from these other proceedings cannot be ascertained,
      the Company does not currently believe that, in the aggregate, these matters
      will result in liabilities material to the Company s financial condition,
      results of operations or cash flows.

Note
      E-Pension Plans  

Prior
      to
      January 1, 2003, substantially all full-time employees were covered by a defined
      benefit pension plan. The benefits under the plan were based on years of service
      and the employee s highest consecutive five-year average compensation. On
      January 1, 2003, the plan was frozen. Accordingly, pension plan participants
      will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will
      join the pension plan. 

On
      January 1, 2003, the Company s supplemental defined benefit pension plan for
      certain highly compensated employees was also frozen. Accordingly, plan
      participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new
      participants will join the supplemental pension plan. 

The
      components of the Company s net periodic benefit cost related to all of its
      pension plans for all periods presented are as follows: 

The
      Company makes contributions in amounts at least equal to the minimum funding
      requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. During
      the
      twenty-four-week period ended February 11, 2006, the Company made approximately
      $700,000 in contributions to the plan and expects to fund another $7 million
      to
      $9 million during the remainder of this fiscal year. 

Note
      F-Financing Arrangements  

The
      Company s long-term debt consisted of the following: 

The
      Company maintains $1.0 billion of revolving credit facilities with a group
      of
      banks, with $300 million expiring in May 2006 and $700 million expiring in
      May
      2010. It is expected that the portion expiring in May 2006 will be renewed,
      replaced or the option to extend the maturity date of the then-outstanding
      debt
      by one year will be exercised. The credit facilities exist primarily to support
      commercial paper borrowings, letters of credit and other short-term unsecured
      bank loans. As the available balance is reduced by commercial paper borrowings
      and certain outstanding letters of credit, the Company had $732.7 million in
      available capacity under these facilities at February 11, 2006. The rate of
      interest payable under the credit facilities is a function of the London
      Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ), the lending bank s base rate (as defined in
      the facility agreements) or a competitive bid rate at the option of the Company.

The
      Senior Notes due April 2006, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings
      are all classified as long-term, as the Company has the ability and intent
      to
      refinance them on a long-term basis. 

The
      Company agreed to observe certain covenants under the terms of its borrowing
      agreements, including limitations on total indebtedness, restrictions on liens
      and minimum fixed charge coverage. All of the repayment obligations under the
      Company s borrowing agreements may be accelerated and come due prior to the
      scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs.
      Additionally, the repayment obligations may be accelerated if AutoZone
      experiences a change in control (as defined in the agreements) of AutoZone
      or
      its Board of Directors. As of February 11, 2006, the Company was in compliance
      with all covenants and expects to remain in compliance with all
      covenants.

      G-Stock Repurchase Program   

As
      of
      February 11, 2006, the Board of Directors had authorized the Company to
      repurchase up to $4.4 billion of common stock in the open market. From January
      1, 1998 to February 11, 2006, the Company has repurchased a total of 87.2
      million shares at an aggregate cost of $4.1 billion; including 123,000 shares
      of
      its common stock at an aggregate cost of $9.8 million during the
      twenty-four-week period ended February 11, 2006.

Comprehensive
      income includes foreign currency translation adjustments; the impact from
      certain derivative financial instruments designated and effective as cash flow
      hedges, including changes in fair value, as applicable, and the reclassification
      of gains and/or losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income
      to offset the earnings impact of the underlying items being hedged; and changes
      in the fair value of certain investments classified as available for sale.

Note
      I-Leases  

During
      the fiscal quarter ended February 12, 2005, the Company completed a detailed
      review of its accounting for rent expense and expected useful lives of leasehold
      improvements. The Company noted inconsistencies in the periods used to amortize
      leasehold improvements and the periods used to straight-line rent expense.
      The
      Company revised its policy to record rent for all operating leases on a
      straight-line basis over the lease term, including any reasonably assured
      renewal periods and the period of time prior to the lease term that the Company
      is in possession of the leased space for the purpose of installing leasehold
      improvements. Differences between recorded rent expense and cash payments are
      recorded as a liability in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities
      on
      the balance sheet. Additionally, all leasehold improvements are amortized over
      the lesser of their useful life or the remainder of the lease term, including
      any reasonably assured renewal periods, in effect when the leasehold
      improvements are placed in service. During the quarter ended February 12, 2005,
      the Company recorded an adjustment in the amount of $40.3 million pre-tax ($25.4
      million after-tax), which included the impact on prior years, to reflect
      additional amortization of leasehold improvements and additional rent expense
      as
      if this new policy had always been followed by the Company. The impact of the
      cumulative adjustment on fiscal 2005 and any prior year is
      immaterial. 

Note
      J-Income Taxes  

During
      the fiscal quarter ended February 12, 2005, the Company recorded a $15.3 million
      reduction to income tax expense primarily due to the American Jobs Creation
      Act
      (the  Act ). The Act was signed into law in October 2004 and provides an
      opportunity to repatriate foreign earnings, reinvest them in the United States,
      and claim an 85% dividend received deduction on the repatriated earnings
      provided certain criteria are met. During the fiscal quarter ended February
      12,
      2005, the Company determined that it met the criteria of the Act, and it decided
      to repatriate its accumulated foreign earnings through fiscal 2005, at which
      time approximated $36.7 million, from its Mexico subsidiaries. As the Company
      had previously recorded deferred income taxes on these amounts, the planned
      repatriation resulted in a one-time reduction to income tax
      expense.

Report
      of
      Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The
      Board
      of Directors and Stockholders 

      AutoZone,
      Inc. 

We
      have
      reviewed the condensed consolidated balance sheet of AutoZone, Inc. as of
      February 11, 2006, the related condensed consolidated statements of income
      for
      the twelve and twenty-four week periods ended February 11, 2006 and February
      12,
      2005, and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the
      twenty-four week periods ended February 11, 2006 and February 12, 2005. These
      financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s
      management. 

We
      conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial
      information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making
      inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is
      substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the
      standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the objective of
      which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken
      as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. 

Based
      on
      our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made
      to the condensed consolidated financial statements referred to above for them
      to
      be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
      principles. 

We
      have
      previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet
      of
      AutoZone, Inc. as of August 27, 2005, and the related consolidated statements
      of
      income, changes in stockholders  equity, and cash flows for the year then ended,
      not presented herein, and, in our report dated October 19, 2005, we expressed
      an
      unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion,
      the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance
      sheet as of August 27, 2005 is fairly stated, in all material respects, in
      relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been
      derived.

Management s
                Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
                Operations.  

Overview  

We
      are
      the nation s leading retailer of automotive parts and accessories, with most of
      our sales to do-it-yourself ( DIY ) customers. As of February 11, 2006, we
      operated 3,743 stores including 88 stores in Mexico and excluding 10 stores
      that
      remain closed as a result of hurricanes, compared with 3,541 stores including
      67
      stores in Mexico, at February 12, 2005. Each of our stores carries an extensive
      product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including
      new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories
      and
      non-automotive products. Many of our stores also have a commercial sales program
      that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products
      to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers and service stations.
      We
      also sell the ALLDATA brand diagnostic and repair software. On the web, we
      sell
      diagnostic and repair information and automotive hard parts, maintenance items,
      accessories and non-automotive products through   www.autozone.com  .
      We do
      not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation. 

Operating
      results for the twelve and twenty-four weeks ended February 11, 2006, are not
      necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year
      ending August 26, 2006. Each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year
      consists of 12 weeks, and the fourth quarter consists of 16 or 17 weeks. Each
      of
      the fourth quarters of fiscal 2005 and 2006 has 16 weeks. Additionally, our
      business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales generally
      occurring in the summer months of June through August and the lowest sales
      generally occurring in the winter months of December through
      February. 

Twelve
      Weeks Ended     February
      11, 2006    ,
          Compared
      with Twelve Weeks Ended     February
      12, 2005  

Net
      sales for the twelve weeks ended   February
      11, 2006  ,
      increased $49.8 million, or 4.1%, over net sales of $1.204 billion for the
      comparable prior year period. This increase in sales was primarily driven by
      sales from new stores as comparable store sales (sales for domestic stores
      opened at least one year) increased 0.4%. DIY sales increased 3.5%, commercial
      sales increased 0.2% and combined sales from our ALLDATA and Mexico operations
      increased 31.4%. 

Gross
      profit for the twelve weeks ended   February
      11, 2006  ,
      was $616.2 million, or 49.1% of net sales, compared with $582.4 million, or
      48.4% of net sales, during the comparable prior year period. The improvement
      in
      gross profit margin was primarily attributable to ongoing category management
      initiatives as well as reduced sales of non-core, lower margin merchandise.

Operating,
      selling, general and administrative expenses for the twelve weeks ended
  February
      11, 2006  ,
      increased by $4.2 million over $433.7 million for the comparable prior year
      period, and decreased as a percentage of net sales from 36.0% to 34.9%. Expenses
      for the twelve weeks ended   February
      11, 2006  ,
      include $4.2 million in share-based compensation expense resulting from the
      current year adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),
       Share-Based Payment  (see  Note B - Share-Based Payments ). Expenses for the
      twelve weeks ended February 12, 2005, include a $40.3 million charge related
      to
      accounting for leases (see  Note I - Leases ). The remaining increase in
      expenses is driven by both short-term expenditures and longer-term efforts
      to
      improve the customer shopping experience, from expanding hours of operation
      to
      continuing to improve the in-store merchandising presentation.  

Interest
      expense, net for the twelve weeks ended   February
      11, 2006  ,
      was $24.3 million compared with $23.6 million during the comparable prior year
      period. This increase was due to higher average borrowing rates over the
      comparable prior year period. Average borrowings for the twelve weeks ended
        February
      11, 2006  ,
      were $1.912 billion, compared with $1.981 billion for the comparable prior
      year
      period. Weighted average borrowing rates were 5.5% at   February
      11, 2006  ,
      and 4.9% at   February
      12, 2005  .

Our
      effective income tax rate was 37.0% of pretax income for the twelve weeks ended
        February
      11, 2006  ,
      and 24.8% for the comparable prior year period. The comparable prior year
      period s effective income tax rate reflects $15.3 million in one-time tax
      benefits related to the repatriation of Mexican earnings as a result of the
      American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and other discrete income tax items (see
       Note J - Income Taxes ). For fiscal 2006, we expect the effective income tax
      rate to approximate 37.0%; however, the actual rate will depend on a number
      of
      factors, including the amount and source of operating income and the timing
      and
      nature of discrete income tax events.    

Net
      income for the twelve week period ended   February
      11, 2006  ,
      increased by $2.9 million to $97.0 million, and diluted earnings per share
      increased by 7.6% to $1.25 from $1.16 in the comparable prior year period.
      The
      impact on current quarter diluted earnings per share from the stock repurchases
      since the end of the comparable prior year period was an increase of
      $0.04.

Twenty-four
      Weeks Ended February 11, 2006,     Compared
      with Twenty-four Weeks Ended February 12, 2005     

Net
      sales for the twenty-four weeks ended February 11, 2006, increased $101.6
      million, or 4.1%, over net sales of $2.490 billion for the comparable prior
      year
      period. This increase in sales was primarily driven by sales from new stores
      as
      comparable store sales (sales for domestic stores opened at least one year)
      increased 0.6%. DIY sales increased 3.9%, commercial sales decreased 0.9% and
      combined sales from our ALLDATA and Mexico operations increased
      28.3%. 

Gross
      profit for the twenty-four weeks ended February 11, 2006, was $1.272 billion,
      or
      49.1% of net sales, compared with $1.203 billion, or 48.3% of net sales, during
      the comparable prior year period. The improvement in gross profit margin was
      primarily attributable to ongoing category management initiatives as well as
      reduced sales of non-core, lower margin merchandise.  

Operating,
      selling, general and administrative expenses for the twenty-four weeks ended
      February 11, 2006, increased by $49.9 million over $838.1 million for the
      comparable prior year period, and increased as a percentage of net sales from
      33.7% to 34.3%. Expenses for the twenty-four weeks ended February 11, 2006,
      include a $2.8 million hurricane related charge and $8.0 million in share-based
      compensation expense resulting from the current year adoption of Statement
      of
      Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),  Share-Based Payment  (see  Note B -
      Share-Based Payments ). Expenses for the twenty-four weeks ended February 12,
      2005, include a $40.3 million charge related to accounting for leases (see
 Note
      I - Leases ). The remaining increase is driven by both short-term expenditures
      and longer-term efforts to improve the customer shopping experience, from
      expanding hours of operation to continuing to improve the in-store merchandising
      presentation.  

Interest
      expense, net for the twenty-four weeks ended February 11, 2006, was $48.1
      million compared with $45.4 million during the comparable prior year period.
      This increase was due to higher average borrowing rates over the comparable
      prior year period. Average borrowings for the twenty-four weeks ended February
      11, 2006, were $1.922 billion, compared with $1.954 billion for the comparable
      prior year period. Weighted average borrowing rates were 5.5% at February 11,
      2006, and 4.9% at February 12, 2005.     

Our
      effective income tax rate was 37.0% of pretax income for the twenty-four weeks
      ended February 11, 2006, and 32.2% for the comparable prior year period. The
      comparable prior year period s effective income tax rate reflects $15.3 million
      in one-time tax benefits related to the repatriation of Mexican earnings as
      a
      result of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and other discrete income
      tax
      items (see  Note J - Income Taxes ). For fiscal 2006, we expect the effective
      income tax rate to approximate 37.0%; however, the actual rate will depend
      on a
      number of factors, including the amount and source of operating income and
      the
      timing and nature of discrete income tax events.    

Net
      income for the twenty-four week period ended February 11, 2006, decreased by
      $5.2 million to $211.4 million, and diluted earnings per share increased by
      2.0%
      to $2.73 from $2.68 in the comparable prior year period. The impact on current
      year diluted earnings per share from the stock repurchases since the end of
      the
      comparable prior year period was an increase of $0.08.    

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources  

The
      primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale
      of
      automotive parts and accessories. For the twenty-four weeks ended February
      11,
      2006, our net cash flows from operating activities provided $199.1 million
      as
      compared with $101.2 million during the comparable prior year period. The
      year-over-year improvement in cash flows from operating activities is primarily
      due to changes in income tax payable impacted by the timing and amounts of
      estimated income tax payments. Cash flows from operating activities continue
      to
      benefit from our inventory purchases being largely financed by our vendors,
      as
      evidenced by an 83% accounts payable to inventory ratio and the use of
      pay-on-scan ( POS ) arrangements with certain vendors, whereby we will not
      purchase merchandise supplied by a vendor until just before that merchandise
      is
      ultimately sold to our customers. Title and certain risks of ownership remain
      with the vendor until the merchandise is sold to our customers. Since we do
      not
      own merchandise under POS arrangements until just before it is sold to a
      customer, such merchandise is not recorded on our balance sheet. Upon the sale
      of the merchandise to our customer, we recognize the liability for the goods
      and
      pay the vendor in accordance with the agreed upon terms. Although we do not
      hold
      title to the goods, we control pricing and have credit collection risk and
      therefore, gross revenues under POS arrangements are included in net sales
      in
      the income statement. We have financed the repurchase of existing merchandise
      inventory by certain vendors in order to convert such vendors to POS
      arrangements. These receivables have remaining durations up to 20 months and
      approximated $30.9 million at February 11, 2006. The $27.9 million current
      portion of these receivables is reflected in accounts receivable and the $3.0
      million long-term portion is reflected as a component of other long-term assets
      at February 11, 2006. Merchandise under POS arrangements was $126.6 million
      at
      February 11, 2006.  

Our
      net
      cash flows from investing activities for the twenty-four weeks ended February
      11, 2006, used $135.5 million as compared with $119.9 million used in the
      comparable prior year period. Capital expenditures for the twenty-four weeks
      ended February 11, 2006, were $115.9 million compared to $118.8 million for
      the
      comparable prior year period. During this twenty-four week period, we opened
      81
      new stores including 7 new stores in Mexico. In the comparable prior year
      period, we opened 59 new stores, including 4 new stores in Mexico. We expect
      to
      invest in our business consistent with historical rates during fiscal 2006,
      primarily related to our new store development program and enhancements to
      existing stores and systems. Investing cash flows were also impacted in the
      current year by our wholly-owned insurance captive, which sold $104.9 million
      in
      short-term investments to partially fund the purchase of $125.5 million in
      marketable debt securities having longer maturities and higher yields. The
      holding of these investments is required by insurance regulations to fund the
      insurance reserves held in our wholly-owned insurance captive subsidiary. The
      Company has classified such investments as available for sale under the
      provisions of   Statement
      of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,  Accounting for Certain Investments
      in Debt and Equity Securities,  as management may elect to sell such securities
      before the stated maturities to either fund insurance reserves or invest in
      other securities with more attractive yields. Accordingly, as such securities
      are available to support the insurance captive subsidiary s operations, they
      have been classified as current assets in the February 11, 2006 condensed
      consolidated balance sheet despite the fact that many of the debt securities
      have a stated maturity of greater than one year as of February 11,
      2006.

Our
      net
      cash flows from financing activities for the twenty-four weeks ended February
      11, 2006, used $57.1 million compared to $22.0 million provided in the
      comparable prior year period. The current year reflects $81.2 million in net
      repayments of commercial paper borrowings versus $266.4 million in net
      repayments from commercial paper in the comparable prior year period. The
      comparable prior year period reflects $300.0 million in proceeds from the
      issuance of debt. Stock repurchases were $9.8 million in the current year as
      compared with $30.0 million in stock repurchases in the comparable prior year
      period. For the twenty-four weeks ended February 11, 2006, exercises of stock
      options provided $33.6 million, including $6.4 million in related tax benefits
      that are reflected in cash flows from financing activities. In the comparable
      prior year period, exercises of stock options provided $28.1 million, including
      $9.7 million in related tax benefits that are reflected in cash flows from
      operating activities. At February 11, 2006, options to purchase 1.7 million
      shares were exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of
      $56.82. 

Depending
      on the timing and magnitude of our future investments (either in the form of
      leased or purchased properties or acquisitions), we anticipate that we will
      rely
      primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to
      support a majority of our capital expenditures, working capital requirements
      and
      stock repurchases. The balance may be funded through new borrowings. We
      anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit
      rating and favorable experiences in the debt market in the past. 

At
      February 11, 2006, AutoZone had a senior unsecured debt credit rating from
      Standard   Poor s of BBB+ and a commercial paper rating of A-2. Moody s
      Investors Service had assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of
      Baa2
      and a commercial paper rating of P-2. As of February 11, 2006, Moody s and
      Standard   Poor s had AutoZone listed as having a  negative  and  stable 
outlook, respectively. If our credit ratings drop, our interest expense may
      increase; similarly, we anticipate that our interest expense may decrease if
      our
      investment ratings are raised. If our commercial paper ratings drop below
      current levels, we may have difficulty continuing to utilize the commercial
      paper market and our interest expense will increase, as we will then be required
      to access more expensive bank lines of credit. If our senior unsecured debt
      ratings drop below investment grade, our access to financing may become more
      limited. 

We
      maintain $1.0 billion of revolving credit facilities with a group of banks,
      with
      $300 million expiring in May 2006 and $700 million expiring in May 2010. It
      is
      expected that the portion expiring in May 2006 will be renewed, replaced or
      the
      option to extend the maturity date of the then-outstanding debt by one year
      will
      be exercised. The credit facilities exist primarily to support commercial paper
      borrowings, letters of credit and other short-term unsecured bank loans. As
      the
      available balance is reduced by commercial paper borrowings and certain
      outstanding letters of credit, we had $732.7 million in available capacity
      under
      these facilities at February 11, 2006. The rate of interest payable under the
      credit facilities is a function of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR),
      the lending bank s base rate (as defined in the facility agreements) or a
      competitive bid rate at our option.  

We
      have
      agreed to observe certain covenants under the terms of our borrowing agreements,
      including limitations on total indebtedness, restrictions on liens and minimum
      fixed charge coverage. All of the repayment obligations under our borrowing
      agreements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date
      if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs. Additionally, the
      repayment obligations may be accelerated if we experience a change in control
      (as defined in the agreements) of AutoZone or its Board of Directors. As of
      February 11, 2006, we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain
      in compliance with all covenants. 

As
      of
      February 11, 2006, the Board of Directors had authorized the Company to
      repurchase up to $4.4 billion of common stock in the open market. From January
      1, 1998 to February 11, 2006, the Company has repurchased a total of 87.2
      million shares at an aggregate cost of $4.1 billion; including 123,000 shares
      of
      its common stock at an aggregate cost of $9.8 million during the twenty-four
      week period ended February 11, 2006. The Company did not repurchase any shares
      of its common stock during the quarter ended February 11, 2006.

Off-Balance
      Sheet Arrangements  

In
      conjunction with our commercial sales program, we offer credit to some of our
      commercial customers. Certain of the receivables related to the credit program
      are sold to a third party at a discount for cash with limited recourse. We
      have
      established a reserve for this recourse. At February 11, 2006, the receivables
      facility had an outstanding balance of $42.9 million and the balance of the
      recourse reserve was approximately $400,000. 

Since
      fiscal year end, we have issued additional and increased existing stand-by
      letters of credit that are primarily renewed on an annual basis to cover premium
      and deductible payments to our workers  compensation carrier. Our total standby
      letters of credit commitment at February 11, 2006 was $131.0 million compared
      with $121.2 million at August 27, 2005, and our total surety bonds commitment
      at
      February 11, 2006, was $13.2 million compared with $13.4 million at August
      27,
      2005. 

AutoZone
      has entered into pay-on-scan ( POS ) arrangements with certain vendors, whereby
      AutoZone will not purchase merchandise supplied by a vendor until just before
      that merchandise is ultimately sold to AutoZone s customers. Title and certain
      risks of ownership remain with the vendor until the merchandise is sold to
      AutoZone s customers. Since the Company does not own merchandise under POS
      arrangements until just before it is sold to a customer, such merchandise is
      not
      recorded on the Company s balance sheet. Upon the sale of the merchandise to
      AutoZone s customers, AutoZone recognizes the liability for the goods and pays
      the vendor in accordance with the agreed-upon terms. Although AutoZone does
      not
      hold title to the goods, AutoZone controls pricing and has credit collection
      risk and therefore, gross revenues under POS arrangements are included in net
      sales in the income statement. Sales of merchandise under POS approximated
      $94.2
      million and $217.4 million for the twelve and twenty-four weeks ended February
      11, 2006, and $87.9 million and $188.0 million for the twelve and twenty-four
      weeks ended February 12, 2005. Merchandise under POS arrangements was $126.6
      million at February 11, 2006, and $151.7 million at August 27,
      2005. 

Critical
      Accounting Policies  

Refer
      to
      our Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated by reference in our
      Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 27, 2005, for a
      summary of our critical accounting policies. The only change to our critical
      accounting policies during fiscal 2006 has been to remove product warranties
      as
      a critical accounting policy due to the insignificance of the remaining warranty
      liability. 

Forward-Looking
      Statements  

Certain
      statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking
      statements. Forward-looking statements typically use words such as  believe, 
 anticipate,   should,   intend,   plan,   will,   expect,   estimate, 
 project,   positioned,   strategy,  and similar expressions. These are based on
      assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and
      perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future
      developments and other factors that they believe to be appropriate. These
      forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties,
      including without limitation, competition; product demand; the economy; the
      ability to hire and retain qualified employees; consumer debt levels; inflation;
      weather; raw material costs of our suppliers; gasoline prices; war and the
      prospect of war, including terrorist activity; availability of commercial
      transportation; construction delays; access to available and feasible financing;
      and       changes
      in laws or regulations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
      performance and actual results; developments and business decisions may differ
      from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and such events
      could materially and adversely affect our business. Forward-looking statements
      speak only as of the date made. Except as required by applicable law, we
      undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements,
      whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Actual
      results may materially differ from anticipated results. Please refer to the
      Risk
      Factors section contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
      year
      ended August 27, 2005, for more information related to those risks.

Quantitative
                and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
                Risk.  

At
      February 11, 2006, the only material changes to our instruments and positions
      that are sensitive to market risk since the disclosures in our 2005 Annual
      Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated by reference in our Annual Report
      on Form   10-K,
      was
      the $81.2 million reduction in commercial paper and the purchase of $125.5
      million in marketable securities, partially off-set by the sale of $104.9 in
      short-term investments, to support the self-insurance reserves in our
      wholly-owned insurance captive subsidiary.  

The
      fair value of our debt was estimated at $1.737 billion as of February 11, 2006,
      and $1.868 billion as of August 27, 2005, based on the quoted market prices
      for
      the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to AutoZone
      for debt of the same remaining maturities. Such fair value is less than the
      carrying value of debt by $42.8 million at February 11, 2006, and greater than
      the carrying value of debt by $6.3 million at August 27, 2005. Considering
      the
      effect of any interest rate swaps designated and effective as cash flow hedges,
      we had $139.3 million of variable rate debt outstanding at February 11, 2006,
      and $221.9 million of variable rate debt outstanding at August 27, 2005. At
      these borrowing levels for variable rate debt, a one percentage point increase
      in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pre-tax earnings
      and cash flows of $1.4 million in fiscal 2006 and $2.2 million in fiscal 2005,
      which includes the effects of interest rate swaps. The primary interest rate
      exposure on variable rate debt is based on LIBOR. Considering the effect of
      any
      interest rate swaps designated and effective as cash flow hedges, we had
      outstanding fixed rate debt of $1.640 billion at February 11, 2006, and at
      August 27, 2005. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce
      the fair value of our fixed rate debt by $58.8 million at February 11, 2006,
      and
      $65.6 million at August 27, 2005.

Controls
                and Procedures.  

As
      of
      February 11, 2006, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with
      the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer
      and
      Principal Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
      of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our
      management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting
      Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
      as
      of February 11, 2006. During or subsequent to the quarter ended February 11,
      2006, there were no changes in our internal controls that have materially
      affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls over
      financial reporting. 

PART
      II. OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
                1.    

Legal
                Proceedings.  

AutoZone,
      Inc. is a defendant in a lawsuit entitled "Coalition for a Level Playing Field,
      L.L.C., et al., v. AutoZone, Inc. et al.," filed in the U.S. District Court
      for
      the Southern District of New York in October 2004. The case was filed by
      approximately 240 plaintiffs, which are principally automotive aftermarket
      warehouse distributors and jobbers (collectively  Plaintiffs ), against 24
      defendants, 11 of which are principally automotive aftermarket retailers (7
      of
      which are AutoZone related entities) and 13 of which are principally aftermarket
      manufacturers. One aftermarket retailer was subsequently dismissed. Of the
      aftermarket manufacturer defendants, 7 settled, were dismissed, or were
      improperly served, and 6 more aftermarket manufacturer defendants were added
      in
      an amended complaint filed in November 2005, leaving 12 aftermarket manufacturer
      defendants; for a current total of 22 remaining defendants ("Defendants").
      In
      the amended complaint the plaintiffs allege, inter alia, that some or all of
      the
      automotive aftermarket retailer defendants have knowingly received, in violation
      of the Robinson-Patman Act (the  Act ), from various of the aftermarket
      manufacturer defendants benefits such as volume discounts, rebates, early buy
      allowances and other allowances, fees, inventory without payment, sham
      advertising and promotional payments, a share in the manufacturers' profits,
      benefits of pay on scan purchases, implementation of radio frequency
      identification technology, and excessive payments for services purportedly
      performed for the manufacturers. Additionally, a subset of plaintiffs alleges
      a
      claim of fraud against the automotive aftermarket retailer defendants based
      on
      discovery issues in a prior litigation involving similar Robinson-Patman Act
      claims. In the prior litigation, the discovery dispute, as well as the
      underlying claims, were decided in favor of AutoZone and the other automotive
      aftermarket retailer defendants who proceeded to trial, pursuant to a unanimous
      jury verdict which was affirmed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. In
      the
      current litigation, plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of damages (including
      statutory trebling), attorneys' fees, and a permanent injunction prohibiting
      the
      aftermarket retailer defendants from inducing and/or knowingly receiving
      discriminatory prices from any of the aftermarket manufacturer defendants and
      from opening up any further stores to compete with plaintiffs as long as
      defendants allegedly continue to violate the Act. The Company believes this
      suit
      to be without merit and is vigorously defending against it. Defendants have
      filed motions to dismiss all claims with prejudice on substantive and procedural
      grounds. Additionally, the Defendants have sought to enjoin plaintiffs from
      filing similar lawsuits in the future. If granted in their entirety, these
      dispositive motions would resolve the litigation in Defendants'
      favor. 

On
      June 22, 2005, the Attorney General of the State of California, in conjunction
      with District Attorneys for San Bernardino, San Joaquin and Monterey Counties,
      filed suit in the San Bernardino County Superior Court against AutoZone, Inc.
      and its California subsidiaries. The San Diego County District Attorney later
      joined the suit. The lawsuit alleges that AutoZone failed to follow various
      state statutes and regulations governing the storage and handling of used motor
      oil and other materials collected for recycling or used for cleaning AutoZone
      stores and parking lots. The suit seeks $12.0 million in penalties and
      injunctive relief.  

AutoZone
      is involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of
      our
      business. Although the amount of liability that may result from these other
      proceedings cannot be ascertained, we do not currently believe that, in the
      aggregate, they will result in liabilities material to our financial condition,
      results of operations, or cash flows.

Changes
                in Securities and Use of
                Proceeds.  

As
      of
      February 11, 2006, the Board of Directors had authorized the Company to
      repurchase up to $4.4 billion of common stock in the open market. The program
      was initially announced in January 1998, and was most recently amended in March
      2005, to increase the repurchases authorization to $4.4 billion from $3.9
      billion. The program does not have an expiration date. From January 1, 1998
      to
      February 11, 2006, the Company has repurchased a total of 87.2 million shares
      at
      an aggregate cost of $4.1 billion, including 123,000 shares of its common stock
      at an aggregate cost of $9.8 million during the twenty-four week period ended
      February 11, 2006. The Company did not repurchase any shares of its common
      stock
      during the quarter ended February 11, 2006.
