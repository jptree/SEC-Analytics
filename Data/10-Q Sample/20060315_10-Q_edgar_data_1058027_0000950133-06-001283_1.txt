STEELCLOUD, INC. 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1. Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation 

Founded in 1987, SteelCloud, Inc. (the  Company ) is a leading supplier of turnkey appliance
servers, network security and infrastructure solutions, and professional Information Technology
( IT ) services. The Company s appliance servers are marketed to large commercial and federal
integrators and software companies so they can deliver their specialized applications and software
products on highly optimized, configuration managed, integrated hardware platforms. Designed to
meet the precise needs of volume customers, a SteelCloud appliance server solution combines
SteelCloud hardware, with SteelCloud self-management software, with a specific operating system and
the customer s application software.

In addition, in collaboration with its strategic partners, the Company provides network security
and infrastructure solutions to end user organizations in both the public and private sectors. In
many cases, the Company augments these products with SteelCloud consulting services.

The Company is making research and development investments in proprietary software (intellectual
property). Its software products include software that adds self-management functionality to its
appliance server offerings and a compliance software package to help organizations address federal
and state legislative acts such as Sarbanes-Oxley.

The consolidated financial statements for the three month periods ended January 31, 2006 and 2005
are unaudited and include all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to
present fairly the results of operations for the periods then ended. All such adjustments are of a
normal and recurring nature. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company, which includes consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto for the years ended October 31, 2005 and 2004.

2. Employee Stock Options 

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004),
  Share-Based Payment   (SFAS 123R) on November 1, 2005. Issued by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) in December 2004, SFAS 123R requires that the compensation cost relating to
share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. Under the provisions of
SFAS 123R, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of
the award, and is recognized over the employee s requisite service period. The Company has adopted
the modified prospective transition method as provided by SFAS 123R and, accordingly, will not be
restating financial statements results for prior periods. Under this method, compensation costs
for all awards granted after the date of adoption and the unvested portion of previously granted
awards outstanding are measured at their estimated fair value.

The Company recognized approximately $35,000 of stock-based compensation expense during the quarter
ended January 31, 2006. The adoption of SFAS 123R had no effect on the Company s basic and diluted
earnings per share for the quarter ended January 31, 2006. The estimated fair value of the
Company s stock-based awards is amortized on a straight-line basis over the awards  vesting period.

4

Prior to November 1, 2005, the Company accounted for employee stock option grants using the
intrinsic method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25   Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees   and accordingly associated compensation expense, if any, was
measured as the excess of the underlying stock price over the exercise price on the date of grant.
The Company also complied with the disclosure option of SFAS No. 123   Accounting for Stock Based
Compensatio n , and SFAS No. 148   Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and
Disclosure  . The following table illustrates the previously disclosed proforma effects on net
income and net income per share if the Company had accounted for its stock plans under the fair
value method of accounting under SFAS 123R:

Incentive Stock Option Plans 

In January 1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Stock Option Plan (the  1997 Option Plan ). Under
the 1997 Option Plan, options to purchase a maximum of 2,650,000 shares of common stock of
SteelCloud, Inc. (subject to adjustments in the event of stock splits, stock dividends,
recapitalizations and other capital adjustments) may be granted to employees, officers and
directors of the Company and certain other persons who provide services to the Company. In
addition, the Company established the 2002 Stock Option Plan (the  2002 Option Plan ) in May 2002,
which permits the Company to grant up to 750,000 options to employees, officers and directors of
the Company and certain other persons who provide services to the Company under that Plan. In May
2004, the Company s shareholders approved an amendment to the Company s 2002 Stock option Plan to
increase the number of options available under the plan from 750,000 to 1,500,000. Stock options
are generally granted at the fair market value of its common stock at the date of grant. The
options vest ratably over a stated period of time not to exceed four years. The contractual terms
of the options are five or ten years.

As of January 31, 2006, there were 322,341 options available for future grants under the 1997
Option Plan, respectively and 1,500,000 options available for future grants under the 2002 Option
Plan, respectively.

The Company did not grant any stock options during the quarter ended January 31, 2006. The fair
value of each option grant is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing fair value model. This model is calculated based on exercise price, an expected
annual dividend yield of 0% and several highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term
and expected stock price volatility over the expected term.

5

A summary of the Company s stock option activity for the three months ended January 31, 2006 is as
follows:

The total options outstanding do not include 600,000 non-qualified options granted to the former
IDP stockholders that are not included in the Option Plan.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the quarter ended January 31, 2006 was
approximately $3,200. Intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the current market
price of the underlying security and the strike price of a related option. As of January 31, 2006
the total intrinsic value of options outstanding was $679,000 and total intrinsic value of
exercisable options was approximately $677,000.

A summary of the Company s outstanding stock options at January 31, 2006 is as follows:

As of January 31, 2006, unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options was
$209,000 which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.42 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 

In August, 1998, the Board adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP ) whereby employees may
purchase Company stock through a payroll deduction plan. The purchase price of the stock is the
lower of 85% of the fair market value on the first or last day of the applicable six month offering
period. All employees, including officers but not directors, are eligible to participate in this
plan. Executive officers whose stock ownership of the Company exceeds five percent of the
outstanding common stock are not eligible to participate in this plan.

For the quarter ended January 31, 2006, the Company did not grant any ESPP awards. The fair value
of each ESPP award is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
fair value model. This model is calculated based on exercise price, an expected annual dividend
yield of 0%, the expected term and a highly subjective assumption, expected stock price volatility
over the expected term. The Company used FASB Technical Bulletin No. 97-1   Accounting under
Statement 123 for Certain Employee Stock Purchase Plans with a Look-Back Option   in determining the
fair value of its ESPP awards.

6

As of January 31, 2006, there was approximately $6,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost
related to ESPP awards that is expected to be recognized in the Company s next fiscal quarter.

3. Operating Leases 

The Company moved its headquarters and operations facilities in April 2005. As such, the Company
has executed non-cancelable leases for these new facilities. The leases expire in August 2009 and
August 2014. Rent expense under these leases, which is recorded on a straight-line basis over the
life of each lease, is approximately $44,000 per month. The new monthly lease amounts include
certain operational and maintenance expenses above and beyond the base rent. The Company also
leases office space in Florida for sales and technical support.

4. Debt 

On March 21, 2005, the Company renewed its bank line of credit that allows the Company to borrow an
amount to the lesser of its collateralized cash on hand or $3.5 million. The line of credit bears
interest at the LIBOR Market Index rate plus 1.25%. The line of credit is secured by all assets of
the Company and expires on March 31, 2006. The Company anticipates that this line of credit will be
renewed. There were no outstanding borrowings on the line of credit at October 31, 2005 and
January 31, 2006.

On February 17, 2004, the Company executed two three-year promissory notes in conjunction with the
purchase of the assets of Asgard Holding LLC ( Asgard ) for an aggregate principal amount of
$170,138. The promissory notes each bear interest at 4% and mature in February 2007. The Company
makes monthly aggregate payments of $4,726 plus accrued interest. The outstanding balance on the
two notes at October 31, 2005 and January 31, 2006 was $75,617 and $61,439, respectively.

5. Deferred Revenue 

Deferred revenue includes amounts received from customers for which revenue has not been
recognized. This generally results from certain customer contracts, OEM (Original Equipment
Manufacturer) releases, warranties, hardware maintenance and support, and consulting services. The
deferred revenue associated with customer contracts and OEM releases represents payments received
for milestones achieved prior to recognition of revenue. This revenue will be recognized as
products are shipped. Revenues from warranties and hardware maintenance and support are recognized
ratably over the service term selected by the customer. Service revenues from consulting are
recognized as the services are performed.

6. Earnings Per Share 

Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period and is calculated by dividing the net earnings (loss) by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding plus common stock equivalents associated with stock options and
warrants and is calculated by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding used in the basic earnings per share calculation plus the common stock equivalent of
stock options and warrants. The dilutive weighted average number of common shares outstanding
excluded potential common shares from stock options of approximately 452,000 for the quarter ended
January 31, 2006. These shares were excluded from the earnings per share calculation due to their
antidilutive effect resulting from the loss from operations.

7. Segment Reporting 

FASB Statement No. 131,  Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information ,
establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are
defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that
is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding
how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company s chief operating decision
maker is the Company s President. While the President is apprised of a variety of financial
metrics and information, the President makes decisions regarding how to allocate resources and
assess performance based on a single operating unit.

7

8. Significant Customer 

For the three months ending January 31, 2006, the Company s significant customer was Lockheed
Martin representing 31% of the Company s net revenues for the three months ending January 31, 2006.
Accounts receivable as of January 31, 2006 included amounts from Lockheed Martin of approximately
$2.0 million or 34% of total net account receivables.

9. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),   Share-Based Payment   (SFAS 123R).
SFAS 123R will require that the compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be
recognized in financial statements. That cost will be measured based on the fair value of the
equity or liability instruments issued. SFAS 123R covers a wide range of share-based compensation
arrangements including share options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share
appreciation rights, and employee share purchase plans. SFAS 123R replaces SFAS No. 123,
  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,   and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,   Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees   (SFAS 123). SFAS 123, as originally issued in 1995, established as preferable
a fair-value-based method of accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees.
However, that Statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in
Opinion 25, as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income would have
been had the preferable fair-value-based method been used. In April 2005, the Securities and
Exchange Commission amended the compliance dates for implementing SFAS 123R. Public entities
(other than those filing as small business issuers) will be required to apply SFAS 123R effective
as of the beginning of the next fiscal year that begins after June 15, 2005, with early adoption
encouraged. The Company adopted SFAS 123R on November 1, 2005 using the modified prospective
method. The effect of the adoption of SFAS 123R are noted in Footnote 2 and did not have a
material impact on the Company s consolidated statements of operations and net loss per share for
the quarter ended January 31, 2006.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Certain statements contained herein may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words or phrases  would be,   will
allow,   intends to,   will likely result,   are expected to,   will continue,   is anticipated, 
 estimate,   project,  or similar expressions are intended to identify  forward-looking
statements . Because such statements include risks and uncertainties, actual results may
differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that
could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, risks associated
with the integration of businesses following an acquisition, competitors with broader product lines
and greater resources, emergence into new markets, the termination of any of the Company s
significant contracts, the Company s inability to maintain working capital requirements to fund
future operations, or the Company s inability to attract and retain highly qualified management,
technical and sales personnel. Statements made herein are as of the date of the filing of this
Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission and should not be relied upon as of any
subsequent date. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, the Company does not undertake, and
the Company specifically disclaims, any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to
reflect occurrences, developments, unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such
statement.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
and notes thereto included in Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005 filed by the Company with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

OVERVIEW 

Founded in 1987, SteelCloud, Inc. (the  Company ) is a leading supplier of turnkey appliance
servers, network security and infrastructure solutions, and professional Information Technology
( IT ) services. The appliance servers are marketed to large commercial and federal integrators
and software companies so they can deliver their specialized applications and software products on
highly optimized, configuration managed, integrated hardware platforms. Designed to meet the
precise needs of volume customers, a SteelCloud appliance server solution combines SteelCloud
hardware, with SteelCloud self-management software, with a specific operating system and the
customer s application software.

In addition, in collaboration with its strategic partners, the Company provides network security
and infrastructure solutions to end user organizations in both the public and private sectors. In
many cases, the Company augments these products with SteelCloud consulting services.

The Company is making research and development investments in proprietary software (intellectual
property). Its software products include software that adds self-management functionality to its
appliance server offerings and a compliance software package to help organizations address federal
and state legislative acts such as Sarbanes-Oxley.

Appliances and Servers 

SteelCloud partners with leading software and technology companies to create branded, turnkey
appliance server products. For each software partner, SteelCloud creates a unique product by
integrating the partner s software onto a custom-designed appliance platform running Linux,
FreeBSD, or one of Microsoft s operating systems. SteelCloud proprietary software,
SteelWorks TM , may also be included to optimize installation, management and support of
the appliance. SteelCloud delivers a unique, optimized appliance that is ready-to-deploy when it
arrives at the end user s site. In addition, the Company offers design, support, and logistical
services, thereby augmenting the partner s internal capabilities. SteelCloud takes responsibility
for those tasks necessary to successfully bring an appliance to market, but which are impractical
for its software partners to perform.

For customers requiring servers that deliver unique performance and/or the ability to withstand
unusual environmental conditions, the Company designs and manufactures specialized custom servers
in collaboration with Intel or AMD. The Company compliments its custom-solutions with specialized
software integration and logistics programs. Thus, its specialized server customers receive
solutions from SteelCloud that are unavailable from traditional computer vendors. The Company
believes that its specialized server products are best suited to address the high volume needs of
the federal government. The Company teams with large federal integrators as its primary channel for
delivering its specialized servers to the federal government.

Network Security and Infrastructure Solutions 

The Company serves the information technology security marketplace with a suite of network security
products from its strategic partners. The Company sells the products to end users along with
SteelCloud consulting, installation and integration services.

SteelCloud s professional consulting services organization provides clients with a seamless
extension of their IT organizations. Technical services include network analysis, network security
audits and appraisals, incident response and remediation services, system design and managed
security services. SteelCloud provides these professional services to public sector organizations
as well as to commercial customers.

Advanced Technology 

The Company has an advanced technology organization that designs and develops SteelCloud
intellectual property in the form of proprietary SteelCloud software products.
SteelWorks TM  is the Company s proprietary software package developed to be the
foundation for SteelCloud s customers to quickly create a fully integrated turnkey appliance. The
Company has already begun delivering its SteelWorks TM  product. The Company s Audit
Compliance System (ACS) is being developed to allow its customers to audit their existing Microsoft
infrastructure. ACS will be brought to market later in fiscal 2006. The Company plans to sell the
product directly to end-users and indirectly through, integrators, OEMs and channel partners.

10

Significant Customer Contracts 

During the three months ending January 31, 2006, the federal integrator represented $2.1 million of
the Company s revenue or 31% of total revenues. The Company recognized approximately $6.8 million
of revenue, representing 74% of total revenues, from one federal integrator during the three month
period ending January 31, 2005. Given the nature of the products manufactured by the Company as
well as the delivery schedules established by its partners, revenue and accounts receivable
concentration by any single customer will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Future revenues and
results of operations could be adversely affected should this customer reduce its purchases,
eliminate product lines or choose not to continue to buy products and services from SteelCloud.

The Company has a multiple award schedule contract with GSA (the  GSA Contract ). The Company s
GSA Contract was originally awarded in April 1996. It was renewed in fiscal 2002 and is valid
through March 31, 2007. The GSA Contract enables government IT purchasers to acquire all of their
requirements from a particular vendor and largely limits the competition to selected vendors
holding GSA Contracts. Although this contract is material, activity on this contract fluctuates
from quarter to quarter. For the three month periods ending January 31, 2006 and 2005, revenues
associated with the Company s GSA Contract were not material.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies:

Revenue Recognition 

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,   Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements, corrected copy   (SAB 104). Generally, SAB 104 requires that
four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (3) the fee is fixed and
determinable: and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured.

Effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003,
the Company has adopted EITF 00-21,   Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables .  Issued in
December 2002, EITF 00-21,   Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables ,  addresses certain
aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple
revenue-generating activities. This Issue addresses when and, if so, how an arrangement involving
multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting. This Issue does not
change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria.

The Company derives its revenue from the following sources: Product revenue, information
technology support services, software license as a reseller and support revenue and software
training and implementation revenue.

For product sales the Company generally recognizes revenue at the time of shipment when title and
risk of loss transfers to the customer. Revenue from hardware leased to customers under operating
lease arrangements is recognized over the contract term. When product and installation services
that are not essential to the functionality of the product are sold as part of a bundled agreement,
the fair value of the installation services, based on the price charged for the services when sold
separately, is deferred and recognized when the services are performed. The products sold are
generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to three years. The Company accrues
an estimated warranty reserve in the period of sale to provide for estimated costs to provide
warranty services.

For services revenue under time and material contracts, the Company recognizes revenue as services
are provided.

The Company is a value-added solution provider for certain software products. When resold software
licenses, and related maintenance, customization and training services are all provided together to
an individual customer the Company recognizes revenue for the arrangement after the Company has
delivered the software license and the customer has approved all implementation and training
services provided. In instances were the Company only resells the software license and maintenance
to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue after the customer has acknowledged and accepted
delivery of the software. The software manufacturer is responsible for providing software
maintenance. Accordingly, revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized upon delivery or
acceptance, as the Company has no future obligation to provide the maintenance services and no
right of return exists.

11

The Company incurs shipping and handling costs, which are recorded in cost of revenues.

Deferred Tax Assets 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of
temporary differences of revenue and expense items for financial statement and income tax purposes.
A valuation allowance is provided to reduce related assets to an amount that is more likely than
not realizable. The Company determines its valuation allowance pursuant to the provisions of
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
  Accounting for Income Taxes  , which requires the Company to weigh all positive and negative
evidence including past operating results and forecasts of future taxable income. In assessing the
amount of the valuation allowance as of January 31, 2006, the Company considered, in particular,
its forecasted operations for the remainder of the current fiscal year, taking into account its
current backlog of orders, including those recently received, and other significant opportunities
currently in its sales and marketing pipeline with a high probability of generating revenues. If
forecasts of taxable income change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust the
valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which would result in additional tax expense or
benefit.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

For the three months ended January 31, 2006 compared to the three months ended January 31, 2005  

Product revenues decreased to $5,988,038 for the three months ended January 31, 2006 from
$8,223,458 for the same period in fiscal 2005, a decrease of $2,235,420 or 27.2%. The decrease is
primarily attributable to the completion of several significant contracts with one federal
integrator during fiscal year 2005. The Company recognized revenue of approximately $6.8 million
associated with this integrator for the three month period ending January 31, 2005 compared to
approximately $2.0 million during the same period in fiscal year 2006. Partially offsetting this
decrease was a higher demand for OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) products generated by new
and existing customers. OEM sales increased by approximately $747,000 for the three month period
ending January 31, 2006, as compared to the same period in fiscal 2005. In addition, security
solution product revenues increased by $1.8 million for the three months ending January 31, 2006
from the same period in 2005 as the result of the Company engaging new channel partners in an
effort to enhance and diversify its product offerings and expand its revenue base.

Service revenues decreased to $674,617 for the three months ended January 31, 2006 from $840,135
for the same period in fiscal 2005, a decrease of $165,518 or 19.7%. The decrease in service
revenues for the three month period ended January 31, 2006 as compared to the same period in fiscal
2005 is primarily the result of the completion of certain long-term contracts. In addition,
investments in training and technical consultant staff were made in order to position the Company
to enter new market segments and provide growth opportunities. As such, revenue activities have
been impacted as time and resources have been required to cultivate these new relationships and
develop these additional service capabilities.

Product gross margin, as a percentage of net revenues, decreased to 20.4% for the three months
ended January 31, 2006 from 27.8% for the same period in fiscal 2005. The decrease in gross margin
for the three months ended January 31, 2006 is primarily due to the decrease in higher margin sales
associated with the completion of several significant contracts during fiscal 2005. In addition,
the decrease can be attributable to the growth in solution product revenues during the three month
period ending 2006 compared to the same period ending 2005. The Company expects gross margin as
a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as product lines expand, new
products are brought to market, start up costs are incurred and new discounts, incentives and
rebates become available.

12

The gross margin for services decreased to $200,703 for the three months ended January 31, 2006
from $248,833 for the same period in fiscal 2005, a decrease of $48,130 or 19%. Gross margin as a
percentage of net revenues was 29.8% and 29.6% for the three months ended January 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively. The decrease in gross margin is attributable to lower service revenue during
the three months ending January 31, 2006 as compared to the three month period ending January 31,
2005. Although the Company was able to maintain a consistent gross margin from services during the
three months ending January 31, 2006 and 2005, first quarter margins historically yield lower
margins due to seasonal fluctuations in consulting utilizations.

Selling and marketing expenses increased to $500,174 for the three months ended January 31, 2006
from $441,985 for the same period in fiscal 2005, an increase of $58,189 or 13.2%. The increase is
the result of deploying selling and marketing resources, primarily additional sales personnel, to
support its new product and services during the three months ending January 31, 2006 compared to
the three month period ending January 31 2005. Although the Company anticipates selling and
marketing expenses to increase as new products and services are introduced, the Company will
continue to evaluate its costs relative to its revenues and gross margins.

Research and product development expenses decreased to $178,363 for the three months ended January
31, 2006 from $213,482 for the same period in fiscal 2005, a decrease of $35,119 or 16.5%. The
decrease is the result of the life cycle of bringing new products to market. The Company s new
proprietary product is nearing completion and as a result, the Company has reallocated its
technical resources from research and development to manufacturing, product support and marketing.
The Company believes that research and development expenses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter
as new products are being developed and introduced into the marketplace.

General and administrative expenses increased to $1,504,036 for the three months ended January 31,
2006 from $1,446,344 for the same period in fiscal 2005, an increase of $57,692 or 4.0%. The
increase is primarily the result of the Company s adoption of SFAS 123(R) during the three months
ending January 31, 2006. For the three months ending January 31, 2006 the Company recorded stock
option compensation expense of $34,293. In addition, rent expense slightly increased in fiscal
2006 as a result of the Company s move during fiscal 2005. As a percentage of revenue, general and
administrative expenses increased to 23% for the three month period ending January 31, 2006 from
16% for the same period in fiscal 2005. The increase is the result of the lower net revenues for
the period ending January 31, 2006 compared to 2005. Although the Company continues to manage its
costs relative to its revenues and gross margins, additional resources will be required in order to
support its new product lines. In addition, the Company expects to incur general and
administrative expenses associated with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. However, at present, it is
difficult to predict the timing and extent of such costs to be incurred in fiscal 2006 due to the
recently announced delay in the implementation date for certain provisions related to internal
control reporting. Management is currently assessing the impact of this deferral on its plans.

Interest income, net, increased to $17,430 for the three months ended January 31, 2006 from $7,709
of interest income, net, for the same period in fiscal 2005, an increase of $9,721 or 126.1%. The
Company s interest income for the three month period ending January 31, 2006 was higher than the
comparable period in fiscal year 2005 due to increases in interest rates and higher cash balances
throughout the three months ending January 31, 2006.

The Company reported a net loss of $(830,884) for the three months ended January 31, 2006 as
compared to a net income of $414,793 for the same period in fiscal 2005. The decrease in net
income for the three months ended January 31, 2006 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2005 is
attributable to the Company s increased deliveries of product associated with significant contract
awards during fiscal year 2005.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

As of January 31, 2006, the Company had working capital of $8.5 million. The Company believes cash
on hand together with cash generated from future operations will provide sufficient financial
resources to finance operations of the Company during the upcoming 12 months.

For the three months ended January 31, 2006, the Company used $1,620,323 in cash from operating
activities. The Company s primary use of cash was the purchase of inventory over that carried in
the prior period of $805,875 and financing an increase in accounts receivable of $531,159.

13

For the three months ended January 31, 2006, the Company invested $42,862 in property and
equipment.

For the three months ended January 31, 2006, the Company used $10,400 from financing activities.
The Company reduced its notes payable balance by $17,688 and generated cash of $7,288 as a result
of the exercise of employee stock options.

On March 21, 2005, the Company renewed its bank line of credit that allows the Company to borrow an
amount to the lesser of its collateralized cash on hand or $3.5 million. The line of credit bears
interest at the LIBOR Market Index rate plus 1.25%. The line of credit is secured by all assets of
the Company and expires on March 31, 2006. The Company anticipates that this line of credit will
be renewed.

In addition, the Company assumed $170,138 of Asgard s debt by executing two three-year promissory
notes. The promissory notes each bear interest at 4% and mature in February 2007. The Company
makes monthly aggregate payments of $4,726 plus accrued interest. The outstanding balance on the
two notes at January 31, 2006 was $61,439.

From time to time, the Company may pursue strategic acquisitions or mergers, which may require
significant additional capital to satisfy unusual or infrequent expenses. In such event, the
Company may seek additional financing of debt and/or equity.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments: 

The Company s significant contractual obligations as of January 31, 2006 are for debt and operating
leases. In April 2005 the Company moved its headquarters and operations facilities. The total
obligation for the new leases, expiring in August 2009 and August 2014, is approximately $44,000 a
month. In addition, the Company leases office space in Florida for sales and technical support.
Debt by year of maturity and future rental payments under operating lease agreements are presented
below. The Company does not have any purchase obligations, capital lease obligations or any
material commitments for capital expenditures as of January 31, 2006. The Company has not engaged
in off-balance sheet financing, commodity contract trading or significant related party
transactions.

Management believes that these commitments will be satisfied with operating cash flows.

14

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The Company is exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates on its debt.
Increase in prevailing interest rates could increase the Company s interest payment obligations
relating to variable rate debt. For example, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would
increase annual interest expense by $35,000 if the Company fully utilized its existing line of
credit.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of SteelCloud s Disclosure Controls and Internal Controls 

SteelCloud evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and
procedures, or  Disclosure Controls,  as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report
on Form 10-Q. This evaluation, or  Controls Evaluation , was performed under the supervision, and
with the participation, of management, including our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer
and Director ( CEO ), our President, and our Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ).

CEO, President and CFO Certifications 

The certifications of the CEO, President, and the CFO required by Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the  Rule 13a-15(e) Certifications  are filed as Exhibit 31 of
this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. This Controls and Procedures section of the quarterly report
includes the information concerning the Controls Evaluation referred to in the Rule 13a-15(e)
Certifications and it should be read in conjunction with the Rule 13a-15(e) Certifications for a
more complete understanding of the topics presented.

Disclosure Controls and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Disclosure Controls are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, such as
this quarterly report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure Controls
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our CEO, President, and CFO, or persons performing similar functions, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and
expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

15

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 

Our management, including our CEO, President, and CFO, does not expect that our Disclosure Controls
or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control
system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within
SteelCloud have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or
more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is
based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no
assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or
deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures. Because of the
inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may
occur and not be detected.

Conclusions 

Based upon the Controls Evaluation, our CEO, President, and CFO have concluded that, subject to the
limitations noted above, our Disclosure Controls are effective to ensure that material information
relating to SteelCloud is made known to management, including the CEO, President, and CFO,
particularly during the period when our periodic reports are being prepared.

During the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, there were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to
materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

16

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

There are routine legal claims pending against the Company that occur in the ordinary course of
business, but in the opinion of management, liabilities, if any, arising from such claims will not
have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operation of the Company.

Other than the items previously disclosed, we are not a party in any other material legal
proceedings.
