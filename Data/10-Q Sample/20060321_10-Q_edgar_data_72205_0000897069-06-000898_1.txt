NOBILITY HOMES,
INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Unaudited)    

1.  Basis of Presentation    

The accompanying unaudited
consolidated financial statements for the three months ended February 4, 2006 and February
5, 2005 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they
do not include all the information and footnotes required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements.   

The unaudited financial information
included in this report includes all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management,
necessary to reflect a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The
operations for the three months ended February 4, 2006 are not necessarily indicative of
the results of the full fiscal year.   

The condensed consolidated financial
statements included in this report should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and notes thereto included in the Registrant s November 5, 2005 Annual
Report on Form 10-K.   

As discussed below in Note 3, the
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 123(R),
Share-Based Payment, effective November 6, 2005. The Company adopted the modified
prospective transition method provided under SFAS No. 123(R) and consequently has not
adjusted results for prior periods.   

2.  Inventories    

Inventories are carried at the lower
of cost or market. Cost of finished home inventories is determined on the specific
identification method. Other inventory costs are determined on a first-in, first-out
basis. Inventories at February 4, 2006 and November 5, 2005 are summarized as follows:   

3.  Accounting for Stock
Based Compensation    

At February 4, 2006, the Company had
a stock incentive plan (the  Plan ), which authorizes the issuance of options to
purchase common stock. Prior to November 6, 2005, the company accounted for the Plan under
the recognition and measurement provisions of APB Opinion No. 25.  Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees,  and related Interpretations, as permitted by FASB Statement No.
123,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.  No stock-based employee compensation
cost was recognized in the Statement of Operations for the three months ended February 5,
2005 as all options granted under the Plan had an exercise price equal to the market value
of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Effective November 6, 2005, the
company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R),  Share-Based
Payment,  using the modified-prospective-transition method. Under that transition
method, compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet
vested as of November 6, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance
with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (b) compensation cost for all
share-based payments granted subsequent to November 6, 2005, based on the grant-date
fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.123(R). Results for
prior periods have not been restated.   

As a result of adopting SFAS
No.123(R) on November 6, 2005, this statement did not have a material effect on the
Company s net income and earning per share for the quarter ended February 4, 2006.

NOBILITY HOMES,
INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Unaudited)    

The following tables illustrates the
effect on net income and earnings per share if the company had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No.123 to options granted under the company s stock
option plans in all periods presented. For purposes of this pro forma disclosure, the
value of the options is estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model and
amortized to expense over the options vesting periods.

NOBILITY HOMES,
INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Unaudited)    

5.  Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates     

The Company applies judgment and
estimates, which may have a material effect in the eventual outcome of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, for accounts receivable, inventory and goodwill. The
following explains the basis and the procedure for each asset account where judgment and
estimates are applied.   

REVENUE RECOGNITION    

The Company recognizes revenue for
the majority of retail sales upon the occurrence of the following:   

its
receipt of a down payment (or with cash sales, its receipt of total payments),   

construction
of the home is complete,   

title
having passed to the retail home buyer,   

funds
having been deposited into the Company's bank account,   

the
home having been delivered and set up at the retail home buyer s site, and   

completion
of any other significant obligations.   

The Company recognizes revenues to independent
dealers upon receiving wholesale floor plan financing or establishing retail credit
approval for terms, shipping of the home, and transferring title and risk of loss to the
independent dealer. For wholesale shipments to independent dealers, the Company has no
obligation to setup the home or to complete any other significant obligations.   

GOODWILL    

Between 1995 and 1998 the Company
acquired retail sales centers using the purchase method of accounting. As a result,
goodwill is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. A valuation was performed by the
Company and it was determined that the estimated fair value of the goodwill in the
accounts exceeded its book value. There is no assurance that the value of the acquired
sales centers will not decrease in the future due to changing business conditions.   

VENDOR VOLUME REBATES    

The Company receives volume rebates
from its vendors based upon reaching a certain level of purchased materials during a
specified period of time. Volume rebates are estimated based upon annual purchases, and
are adjusted quarterly if the accrued volume rebate is applicable.   

DEALER VOLUME REBATE    

The Company pays a volume rebate to
independent dealers based upon the dollar volume of homes purchased and paid for by the
dealer in excess of a certain specific dollar amount during a specific time period. Dealer
volume rebates are accrued when sales are recognized.   

6.  Recent Accounting
Pronouncements    

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No.
154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, ( FAS 154 ). FAS 154 replaces APB
No. 20,  Accounting Changes , and FAS 3,  Reporting Changes in Interim
Financial Statements . FAS 154 changes the accounting for, and reporting of, a change
in accounting principle. FAS 154 requires retrospective application to the prior
period s financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principle and
changes required by new accounting standards when the standard does not include specific
transition provisions, unless it is impractical to do so. FAS 154 is effective for
accounting changes and corrections of errors in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2005. Currently, the Company is not aware of any financial impact
that the adoption of this Statement will have on its consolidated financial statements.   

7.  Commitments and
Contingent Liabilities    

The Company has been subject to an
ongoing Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) examination for the years ended
November 6, 2004 and November 1, 2003. The IRS Agent s report for fiscal years 2004
and 2003 proposes additional taxes of approximately $426,000 and $732,000, respectively,
which relates to a potential accumulated earnings tax. Management intends to vigorously
contest the IRS Agent s position. Accordingly, no accrual has been made in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for the contested tax adjustments since the
ultimate liability, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Any ultimate
liability related to this accumulated earnings tax is not expected to be material in
relation to the consolidated financial position of the Company, but could be material in
relation to the earnings of the period in which a determination occurs.

NOBILITY HOMES, INC.   

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

Results of Operations    

For the three month periods ended
February 4, 2006 and February 5, 2005, results of operations are as follows. Total net
sales in first quarter 2006 increased 19% to $13,750,595 compared to $11,511,134 in the
first quarter of 2005. The increased sales in first quarter of 2006 were primarily due to
33% increase in sales from the Company s retail sales centers. First quarter sales of
fiscal 2006, historically our weakest quarter, continued to be adversely impacted by the
very competitive and difficult environment in the manufacturing housing industry. First
quarter sales of fiscal year 2006, although a strong sales quarter for our retail
organization, were adversely impacted by the volatile pricing in lumber, OSB, sheetrock,
steel and oil related products and services. Overall, most construction materials,
including materials used in the set-up of our homes, have increased or fluctuated widely
in price over the past year with little price stability in sight. Nobility continues to
out-perform the industry, however in the near term we anticipate continued pressure on
both sales and earnings resulting from these factors. Management remains optimistic for
fiscal 2006, convinced that our specific geographic market is one of the best long-term
growth areas in the country and because of the strong operating leverage inherent in the
Company. With an improving economy, declining unemployment claims, and increasing but
still low interest rates in 2006, management expects the demand for our homes to grow.
Increased demand should also result from building replacement homes from the hurricanes in
autumn of 2004. The Company is well positioned to capitalize on the demand in the future
by controlling the retail distribution, financing, and insuring of our homes and by being
financially sound to take advantage of opportunities as they develop.   

Gross profit as a percentage of net
sales was 29.9% in first quarter 2006 compared to 27.9% in first quarter 2005. The
increase in gross profit, as a percentage of sales, in first quarter 2006 was primarily
due to increased sales at the Company s retail sales centers.   

Selling, general and administrative
expenses as a percent of net sales were 15.7% in first quarter of 2006 compared to 15.6%
in the first quarter of 2005.   

The Company earned interest on cash
equivalents and investments in the amount of $199,009 for the first quarter of 2006
compared to $128,118 for the first quarter of 2005. The increased interest income was
primarily due to a change in the investment portfolio to long-term marketable securities
to obtain a higher yield.   

The Company earned from Majestic 21
$101,545 in the first quarter of 2006 compared to $84,579 for the first quarter of 2005.
Income reported for Majestic 21 results from the Company s 50% share in the equity in
the earnings of this joint venture. Majestic 21 is a financing joint venture accounted for
under the equity method of accounting. Income for the joint venture fluctuates due to
higher amortization of prepaid finance charges on the portfolio. The Company believes that
Majestic s historical loss experience has been favorably impacted by its ability to
resell foreclosed/repossessed homes through its network of retail sales centers.   

As a result of the factors discussed
above, earnings for the first quarter of 2006 were $1,490,437 or $.36 per diluted share
compared to $1,072,780 or $.26 per diluted share for the first quarter 2005.   

Liquidity and Capital
Resources    

Cash and cash equivalents were
$12,382,331 at February 4, 2006 compared to $14,368,183 at November 5, 2005. Short and
long-term investments were $12,219,346 at February 4, 2006 compared to $12,247,591 at
November 5, 2005. Working capital was $17,777,947 at February 4, 2006 as compared to
$17,555,635 at November 5, 2005. Nobility owns the entire inventory for its Prestige
retail sales centers and does not incur any third party floor plan financing expenses.
Inventories increased to $11,389,545 at February 4, 2006, from $9,549,486 at November 5,
2005 primarily due to an increase in the number of Prestige retail homes in various stages
of completion on customer s home sites.   

Nobility paid an annual cash dividend
of $0.30 per common share for fiscal year 2005 on January 13, 2006 in the amount of
$1,217,618. On January 14, 2005 the Company paid an annual cash dividend of $0.20 per
common share for fiscal year 2004 in the amount of $807,826.   

In January 2005, the Company
purchased land for a new Prestige retail sales center in Punta Gorda, Florida for a
purchase price of $350,000.   

Nobility maintains a revolving credit
agreement with a major bank providing for borrowing up to $4,000,000. At February 4, 2006
and November 5, 2005, there were no amounts outstanding under this agreement.   

9   

NOBILITY HOMES, INC.   

Nobility s operations may
require significant capital expenditures during fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, as
the Company looks to increase manufacturing plant capacity and purchase some of our
current retail sales centers locations that are currently leased. A more aggressive stock
buy back, in part to reduce the total number of small shareholders and to cover option
grants, may require additional capital requirements. Working capital requirements for any
increase in the new home inventory for existing and any new retail sales centers will be
met with internal sources.   

Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates     

The Company applies judgment and
estimates, which may have a material effect in the eventual outcome of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, for accounts receivable, inventory and goodwill. The
following explains the basis and the procedure for each asset account where judgment and
estimates are applied.   

REVENUE RECOGNITION    

The Company recognizes revenue for
the majority of retail sales upon the occurrence of the following:   

its
receipt of a down payment (or with cash sales, its receipt of total payments),   

construction
of the home is complete,   

title
having passed to the retail home buyer,   

funds
having been deposited into the Company s bank account,   

the
home having been delivered and set up at the retail home buyer s site, and   

completion
of any other significant obligations.   

The Company recognizes revenues to independent
dealers upon receiving wholesale floor plan financing or establishing retail credit
approval for terms, shipping of the home, and transferring title and risk of loss to the
independent dealer. For wholesale shipments to independent dealers, the Company has no
obligation to setup the home or to complete any other significant obligations.   

GOODWILL    

Between 1995 and 1998 the Company
acquired retail sales centers using the purchase method of accounting. As a result,
goodwill is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. A valuation was performed by the
Company and it was determined that the estimated fair value of the goodwill in the
accounts exceeded its book value. There is no assurance that the value of the acquired
sales centers will not decrease in the future due to changing business conditions.   

VENDOR VOLUME REBATES    

The Company receives volume rebates
from its vendors based upon reaching a certain level of purchased materials during a
specified period of time. Volume rebates are estimated based upon annual purchases, and
are adjusted quarterly if the accrued volume rebate is applicable.   

DEALER VOLUME REBATE    

The Company pays a volume rebate to
independent dealers based upon the dollar volume of homes purchased and paid for by the
dealer in excess of a certain specific dollar amount during a specific time period. Dealer
volume rebates are accrued when sales are recognized.   

Forward-Looking Statements    

Certain statements in this report are
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including
our statement that working capital requirements will be met with internal sources.
Although Nobility believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking
statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there are risks and uncertainties that may
cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. These risks and uncertainties
include, but are not limited to, competitive pricing pressures at both the wholesale and
retail levels, increasing material costs, continued excess retail inventory, increase in
repossessions, changes in market demand, changes in interest rates, availability of
financing for retail and wholesale purchasers, consumer confidence, adverse weather
conditions that reduce sales at retail centers, the risk of manufacturing plant shutdowns
due to storms or other factors, the impact of marketing and cost-management programs,
reliance on the Florida economy, impact of labor shortage, impact of materials shortage,
increasing labor cost, cyclical nature of the manufactured housing industry, impact of
rising fuel costs, catastrophic events impacting insurance costs, availability of
insurance coverage for various risks to Nobility, market demographics, management s
ability to attract and retain executive officers and key personnel, increased global
tensions, market disruptions resulting from terrorist or other attack and any armed
conflict involving the United States and the impact of inflation.

NOBILITY HOMES, INC.   

Item 3.  Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   

Certain of the Company s
financial instruments are subject to market risk, including interest rate and equity price
risks; however, due to the makeup of our investment portfolio this market risk is
considered minimal. The Company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular
operating and financing activities.   

We do not engage in investing in or
trading market risk sensitive financial instruments. We also do not purchase for
investing, hedging, or for purposes  other than trading  financial instruments
that are likely to expose us to significant market risk, whether interest rate, foreign
currency, commodity price, or equity price risk. The Company s financial instruments
are not currently subject to foreign currency or commodity risk. The Company has no
financial instrument held for trading purposes.   

We do not have any indebtedness as of
February 4, 2006. If we were to borrow from our revolving credit agreement, we would be
exposed to changes in interest rates. Under our current policies, we do not use interest
rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes.   

Item 4. Controls and
Procedures   

a.   
  Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company s Chief                Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness                of
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is
               defined in Rules 13a   15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange                Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) as of
               February 4, 2006 (the  Evaluation Date ). Based on
such                evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of the Evaluation
Date, the                Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective
in alerting them                on a timely basis to material information relating to the
Company (including its                consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included
in the Company s reports                filed or submitted under the Exchange Act.
There have been no changes in the                Company s internal controls over
financial reporting identified in                connection with this evaluation that
occurred during the period covered by this                report and that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially                affect, the Company s
internal controls over financing reporting.

Issuer Repurchases of
Securities   

(1)              Since
1999, the Company s board of directors has authorized a share           repurchase
program that permits the Company to repurchase 100,000 shares of its           common
stock, subject to compliance with applicable legal restrictions and so           long as
the repurchases would not have the effect of causing the Company s           common
stock to be delisted from trading.  Until revoked, the share
          repurchase limit is automatically reset at 100,000 shares after any repurchases
          are made under the program.
