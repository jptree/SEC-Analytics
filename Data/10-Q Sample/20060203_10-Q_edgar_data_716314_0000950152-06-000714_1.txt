GRAHAM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
December 31, 2005 
(Unaudited)

NOTE 1
  BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Graham Corporation s (the  Company s ) condensed consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States for
interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation
S-X. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all information and notes
required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States for complete financial
statements. The March 31, 2005 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet was derived from the Company s
audited Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2005. For additional information, please refer
to the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form
10-K, as amended by Form 10-K/A, for the year ended March 31, 2005. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments, including normal recurring accruals considered necessary for a fair presentation,
have been included. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform with
the current year presentation.

The Company s results of operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005 and
cash flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2005 are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be expected for the year ending March 31, 2006.

On July 28, 2005, the Company s Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split of the
Company s common shares. The two-for-one stock split was effected as a stock dividend, and
stockholders received one additional share of common stock for every share of common stock held on
the record date of September 1, 2005. The new common shares were distributed on October 3, 2005.
All share and per share amounts disclosed in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have
been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.

All dollar amounts are presented in thousands, except per share data.

NOTE 2
  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION:

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.  As permitted by
SFAS No. 123, the Company continues to measure compensation for stock-based compensation plans
using the intrinsic value based method of accounting, prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
( APB ), Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.  Accordingly, compensation
cost for stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the
Company s common stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the
stock. Compensation cost for share equivalent units is recorded in accordance with the terms of the
Company s Long-Term
Incentive Plan based on the

7

Table of Contents   

higher of the quoted market price of the Company s common stock at
the end of the period up to $8 per unit or the stock price at the date of grant. See Note 15
 Accounting and Reporting Changes  for a discussion regarding the impact of SFAS No. 123(R).

Under the intrinsic value method, no compensation expense has been recognized for the
Company s stock option plans. Had compensation cost for the Company s stock option plans been
determined based on the fair value at the grant date for awards under those plans in accordance
with the fair value methodology prescribed under SFAS No. 123, the Company s net income (loss) and
net income (loss) per share would have been the pro forma amounts indicated below:

For purposes of the disclosure above, the fair value of each option grant is estimated on
the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions used for grants in fiscal years 2006 and 2005:

NOTE 3
  REVENUE RECOGNITION

The Company recognizes revenue on all contracts with a planned manufacturing process in excess
of four weeks (which approximates 575 direct labor hours) using the percentage-of-completion
method. The percentage-of-completion method is determined by comparing actual labor incurred to a
specific date to management s estimate of the total labor to be incurred on each contract.
Contracts in progress are reviewed monthly, and sales and earnings are adjusted in current
accounting periods based on revisions in the contract value and estimated costs at completion.
Losses on contracts are recognized immediately when known.

Revenue on contracts not accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method is recognized
utilizing the completed contract method. The majority of the Company s contracts have a planned
manufacturing process of less than four weeks and the results reported under this method do not
vary materially from the percentage-of-completion method. The Company recognizes revenue and all
related costs on the completed contract method upon substantial completion or shipment of products
to the customer. Substantial
completion is consistently defined as at least 95% complete with regard to direct

8

Table of Contents   

labor hours.
Customer acceptance is generally required throughout the construction process and the Company have
no further material obligations under the contract after the revenue is recognized.

NOTE 4   INVESTMENTS

Investments consist of fixed-income debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury with original
maturities of greater than three months and less than one year. All investments are classified as
held-to-maturity as the Company has the intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. The
investments are stated at amortized cost which approximates fair value. All the investments mature
between January 5 and April 6, 2006.

NOTE 5   INVENTORIES

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, using the average cost method. For
contracts accounted for on the completed contract method, progress payments received are netted
against inventory to the extent the payment is less than the inventory balance relating to the
applicable contract. Progress payments that are in excess of the corresponding inventory balance
are presented as customer deposits in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unbilled revenue
in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets represents revenue recognized that has not been billed
to customers on contracts accounted for on the percentage-of-completion method. For contracts
accounted for on the percentage-of completion method, progress payments are netted against unbilled
revenue to the extent the payment is less than the unbilled revenue for the applicable contract.
Progress payments exceeding unbilled revenue are netted against inventory to the extent the payment
is less than or equal to the inventory balance relating to the applicable contract, and the excess
is presented as customer deposits in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Major classifications of inventories are as follows:

NOTE 6   INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE:

Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding
for the period. Common shares outstanding include share equivalent units,

9

Table of Contents   

which are
contingently issuable shares. Diluted income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income
(loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and, when applicable, potential
common shares outstanding during the period.

A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of basic and diluted income (loss) per
share from continuing operations is presented below:

There were 439,910 options to purchase shares of common stock at various exercise prices
that were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share for the three and nine-month
periods ended December 31, 2004 as the effect would be anti-dilutive due to the net losses for the
periods.

NOTE 7   PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY

The reconciliation of the changes in the Company s product warranty liability is as follows:

NOTE
8   CASH FLOW STATEMENT

Interest paid from continuing operations was $19 for both nine month periods ended December
31, 2005 and 2004. In addition, income taxes paid (refunded) from continuing operations were $85
and $(886) for the nine months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Non-cash activities during the nine months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 included dividends
of $94 and $83, respectively, which were recorded but not paid. In addition, in the nine months
ended December 31, 2005, capital expenditures totaling $33 were financed through capital leases.

NOTE 9   COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)

Total comprehensive income (loss) was as follows:

NOTE 10
  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The components of the Company s pension cost are as follows:

The Company made contributions of $3,576 to its defined benefit pension plan during the
nine months ended December 31, 2005. The Company does not expect to make any contributions to the
plan for the balance of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2006.

The components of the postretirement benefit income are as follows:

The Company paid benefits of $28 related to its postretirement benefit plan during the
nine months ended December 31, 2005. The Company expects to pay benefits of approximately $125 for
the balance of fiscal year ending March 31, 2006.

NOTE 11   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On March 15, 2005, the Company s Board of Directors approved a plan to dispose of its U.K.
operations, which included the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Graham Vacuum and Heat Transfer
Limited ( GVHT ) and all its subsidiaries, including GVHT s operating subsidiary Graham Precision
Pumps Limited ( GPPL ) located in Congleton, Cheshire, U.K. GPPL manufactured liquid ring vacuum
pumps and complete vacuum pump systems for use in the chemical, petrochemical, petroleum refining
and power industries. The Company s results of operations for the three and nine months ended
December 31, 2004 have been restated to reflect the U.K. companies as a discontinued operation.

Table of Contents   

NOTE 12   OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE

In September 2004, the Company settled a contract dispute with a customer regarding
cancellation charges. As a result of the settlement, other income of $1,592 was presented in the
caption  Other Income  in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Retained Earnings
for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2004.

In November 2004, the Company entered into an Agreement and General Release in connection with
the retirement of its former President and CEO. The agreement was accounted for as an individual
deferred compensation arrangement, and, therefore, an expense of $648 was recognized and included
in the caption  Other Expense  in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Retained Earnings
for the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2004. The current and long-term portions
of the related liability at December 31, 2005 were $166 and $232, respectively, and $198 and $322,
respectively, at March 31, 2005. These amounts are included in the captions  Accrued Expenses and
Other Liabilities  and  Other Long-Term Liabilities  in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December
31, 2005 and March 31, 2005.

NOTE 13   CONTINGENCIES

The Company has been named as a defendant in certain lawsuits alleging personal injury from
exposure to asbestos contained in products made by the Company. The Company is a co-defendant with
numerous other defendants in these lawsuits and intends to vigorously defend itself against these
claims. The claims are similar to previous asbestos lawsuits that named the Company as defendant,
which either were dismissed when it was shown that the Company had not supplied products to the
plaintiffs  places of work or were settled for minimal amounts below the expected defense costs.
Neither the outcome of these lawsuits nor the potential for liability can be determined at this
time.

From time to time in the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to legal
proceedings and potential claims. At December 31, 2005, management was unaware of any additional
litigation matters.

NOTE 14   SALE OF TREASURY STOCK

On November 23, 2005, the Company completed the sale of 198,246 shares of its common stock
previously held as treasury shares. The shares were sold at $18.00 per share in privately
negotiated transactions. As a result of the sale, treasury stock was reduced by $1,385 and capital
in excess of par value was increased by $2,183.

NOTE 15   ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING CHANGES

In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued SFAS No. 151,
 Inventory Costs.  SFAS No. 151 amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4,  Inventory
Pricing , to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs and wasted material. SFAS No. 151 requires that those items be recognized as
current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of  abnormal  contained in
SFAS No. 151. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to
the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during the Company s fiscal year ending March 31,
2007. Although the Company believes the adoption of SFAS No. 151 may result in the acceleration of
recognizing indirect manufacturing expenses during times of below normal utilization of plant
capacity, below normal utilization of plant capacity is not predicted for the immediate
future. Management has not yet determined the long-term impact on the Company s Consolidated
Financial Statements of adopting SFAS No. 151.

The FASB also issued in December 2004, SFAS No. 123(R),  Share-Based Payment.  SFAS No.
123(R) requires that all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options, be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2005. In addition, SFAS No. 123(R) will cause unrecognized expense (based
on the fair values determined for the pro forma footnote disclosure, adjusted for estimated
forfeitures) related to options vesting after the date of initial adoption to be recognized as a
charge to results of operations over the remaining vesting period. Under SFAS No. 123(R), the
Company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share-based
payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the
date of adoption. The Company has decided to use the Black-Scholes fair value model and the
modified prospective transition method. The modified prospective method requires that compensation
expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and share awards at the beginning of the first
quarter of adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). The Company has determined that the impact of initially
adopting SFAS No. 123(R) will be immaterial to its Consolidated Financial Statements, as all stock
options currently issued are fully vested. For additional information, see Note 2,  Stock-Based
Compensation , to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation ( FIN ) No. 47,  Accounting for Conditional
Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.  FIN No. 47 clarifies
the term  conditional asset retirement obligation  as used in SFAS No. 143,  Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations , and provides further guidance as to when an entity would have sufficient
information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. During the
third quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company adopted FIN No. 47. The impact of adopting FIN No.
47 was immaterial to the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash
flows.

GRAHAM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

December 31, 2005 

(Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data) 

OVERVIEW 

The corporate office and production facility of Graham Corporation ( we ,  us  or  our ) are
located in Batavia, New York. Our current fiscal year commenced April 1, 2005 and will end March
31, 2006.

We are a designer, manufacturer and worldwide supplier of ejectors, pumps, condensers and heat
exchangers. The principal markets for our equipment are the petrochemical, oil refinery and
electric power generation industries, including cogeneration and geothermal plants. Our equipment
can also be found in diverse applications such as metal refining, pulp and paper processing,
shipbuilding, water heating, refrigeration, desalination, food processing, drugs, heating,
ventilating and air conditioning.

The current level of product inquiries gives us reason to believe that we continue to be in a
period of increased capital spending by customers, which we believe should continue to positively
impact our business for the immediate future. Global growth and expansion in oil refineries,
petrochemical plants and power generation are driving current product demand. Because our products
are capital goods, industrial downturns can have a material adverse impact on sales.

In May 2005, we disposed of our subsidiary located in the United Kingdom that manufactured
vacuum pumps. This disposition was presented as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Retained Earnings and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2005.

HIGHLIGHTS 

Highlights for the nine month period ended December 31, 2005:

15

Table of Contents   

Gross profit margins and operating margins were 29% and 10%, respectively, through the
nine months ended December 31, 2005 compared with 15% and negative 2%, respectively, for
the nine months ended December 31, 2004. 

In November 2005, the sale of 198,246 shares of common stock, which previously had been
held as treasury shares, was completed for approximately $3.4 million. 

In January 2006, the position of Vice President of Asia Operations was established for
the purpose of developing and implementing marketing, manufacturing and engineering
strategic growth opportunities in Asia. 

The principal market drivers that we believe are contributing to sales growth include: 

Global consumption of crude oil is estimated to expand significantly over the
next 15 years. 

It is generally believed that there is a shortage of global oil refining
capacity. 

There is a significant differential in raw material prices between higher and
lower quality crude oil. To lower production costs, many refineries are upgrading
facilities in order to be able to process lower grades of crude oil. 

Supplies of sweet crude oil are being depleted. Sour crude sources are
identified and are believed to be plentiful. 

Environmental regulations in numerous countries requiring lower sulfur emissions
are requiring refineries to upgrade their facilities. 

The expansion of a middle class in Asia is driving greater demand for power and
petrochemical products. 

The high cost of natural gas in North America and Europe is leading to the
construction of new petrochemical plants in the Middle East where natural
gas is plentiful and inexpensive. 

The global economy is expanding. 

There is an increased need in certain regions for geothermal electrical power
plants to meet electricity demand. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This report and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission include
 forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may
cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by the
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements
about:

the current and future economic environments affecting us and the markets we serve; 

sources of revenue and anticipated revenue, including the contribution from the
growth of new products and markets; 

16

Table of Contents   

plans for future products and services and for enhancements of existing products and
services; 

estimates regarding our liquidity and capital requirements; 

the ability to attract or retain customers; 

the outcome of any existing or future litigation; and 

intellectual property. 

Forward-looking statements are usually accompanied by words such as  anticipate,   believe, 
 estimate,   may,   intend,   expect  and similar expressions. Actual results could differ
materially from historical results or those implied by the forward-looking statements contained in
this report. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements. Except as
required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or announce any revisions to forward-looking
statements contained in this report, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS 

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based
upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

Critical accounting policies are defined as those that reflect significant judgments and
uncertainties, and could potentially result in materially different results under different
assumptions and conditions.

Revenue Recognition    We recognize revenue on all contracts with a planned manufacturing process in
excess of four weeks (which approximates 575 direct labor hours) using the percentage-of-completion
method. The percentage-of-completion method is determined by comparing actual labor incurred to a
specific date to management s estimate of the total labor to be incurred on each contract.
Contracts in progress are reviewed monthly, and sales and earnings are adjusted in current
accounting periods based on revisions in the contract value and estimated costs at completion.
Losses on contracts are recognized immediately when known.

Revenue on contracts not accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method is recognized
utilizing the completed contract method. The majority of the contracts we enter into have a
planned manufacturing process of less than four weeks and the results reported under this method do
not vary materially from the percentage-of-completion method. We recognize revenue and all
related costs on the completed contract method upon substantial completion or shipment of
products to the customer. Substantial completion is consistently defined as at least 95% complete
with regard to direct labor hours. Customer acceptance is generally required throughout the
construction process and we have no further
material obligations under the contract after the revenue is recognized.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits    Defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit
costs and obligations are dependent on

17

Table of Contents   

actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts.
These assumptions are reviewed annually by management and include the discount rate, long-term
expected rate of return on plan assets, salary growth, healthcare cost trend rate and other
economic and demographic factors. We base the discount rate assumption for our plans on Moody s or
Citigroup Pension Liability Index AA-rated corporate long-term bond yield rate. The long-term
expected rate of return on plan assets is based on the plan s asset allocation, historical returns
and management s expectation as to future returns that are expected to be realized over the
estimated remaining life of the plan liabilities that will be funded with the plan assets. The
salary growth assumptions are determined based on long-term actual experience and future and
near-term outlook. The healthcare cost trend rate assumptions are based on historical cost and
payment data, the near-term outlook, and an assessment of the likely long-term trends.

To the extent that actual results differ from assumptions, the differences are reflected as
unrecognized gains and losses and are amortized to earnings over the estimated future service
period of the plan participants to the extent such total net recognized gains and losses exceed 10%
of the greater of the plan s projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of assets.
Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in future assumptions would
affect pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations.

Income Taxes    Deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of events have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using current tax rates. We evaluate the
available evidence about future taxable income and other possible sources of realization of
deferred income tax assets and record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets to
an amount that represents our best estimates of the amounts of such deferred income tax assets that
more likely than not will be realized.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced performance for the three and
nine-month periods ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the following discussion should be read in
conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report.

Sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 were $13,504, a 25% increase, as compared
with $10,783 for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. Sales for the nine months ended December 31,
2005 were $39,297, a 40% increase, compared with $28,135 for the nine months ended December 31,
2004. The growth in sales for the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2005 resulted
from increases in both domestic and export business, with export sales to Canada, Asia, Mexico and
the Middle East having the greatest improvement compared with the prior year periods. By
geographical location, sales into Canada were for tar sands and general refinery applications;
sales to Asia were primarily for petrochemical projects; sales to Mexico were primarily for
refinery work; and sales to the Middle East were primarily for both refinery and chemical projects.
Sales, by product, were up due to significantly greater demand for condensers and ejectors.
Condenser sales for the three and nine-month periods increased 29% and 97%, respectively, over the
three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2004. Ejector sales increased over the same
respective periods 65% and 73%. Increased sales of condenser products were largely a result of
capacity expansion projects in the petrochemical market. Increased ejector sales were primarily a
result of oil refinery upgrade and expansion activities. The latter activity is largely due to the
growing utilization of lower quality  sour  crude oil (as opposed to higher quality  sweet  crude
oil) as the core raw material for refinery processes as well as compliance with new environmental
regulations in numerous countries related to clean fuels and capacity additions. The increase in
capacity in the petrochemical sector is being driven by greater worldwide demand for, and
consumption of, oil and natural gas by-products.

Gross profit margin for the three months ended December 31, 2005 was 27%, compared with 24%
for the three months ended December 31, 2004. Gross profit margin for the nine months ended
December 31, 2005 was 29% compared with 15% for the nine months ended December 31, 2004. The
improvement in gross profit margin for the three and nine-month periods was due to greater sales
volume and selling price increases. We were able to obtain greater volume and higher selling
prices and be more selective in orders accepted as a result of improved product demand. Going
forward, we anticipate increased pressure on gross margin because of higher costs of materials,
energy and increasing labor and benefit costs. In addition, given the sales opportunities we
believe exist in Asia and elsewhere, we have strategically increased our emphasis in those markets.
Although we believe that such markets are likely to have lower margin potential because of their
specific economic climates, we believe that the expansion of operations into these markets will
longer term deliver benefits worth making the investments now.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were 20% of sales for the current quarter,
compared with 19% for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. Selling, general and administrative
expenses were 19% of sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2005, compared with 21% for the
nine months ended December 31, 2004. Actual expenses for the three and nine-month periods ended
December 31, 2005 increased 35% and 27%, respectively, primarily as a result of increased travel,
consulting, accounting and variable compensation expenses, and from the addition of sales personnel
in Europe and China. The majority of these expense increases were related to the robust business
climate and longer-term growth opportunities that we believe are currently available to us.

Other income of $1,592 for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2004 resulted from a
settlement of a contract dispute over cancellation charges. There was no other income for the
three-month periods ended December 31, 2005 or 2004 or for the nine-month period ended December 31,
2005.

Other expense recognized in the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2004 of $648
was incurred as a result of our entering into an Agreement and General Release with the former
President and CEO. As a result of this agreement, such former President and CEO has been retained
as an independent consultant through November 8, 2008 and is provided consulting fees and medical,
dental and insurance benefits. The former President and CEO is also advising us on sales
opportunities in Mexico and South America. There was no other expense for the three and nine
months ended December 31, 2005.

Interest expense was $4 for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, compared with $9 for the
quarter ended December 31, 2004. For the nine months ended December 31, 2005 interest expense was
$13, compared with $19 for the nine months ended December 31, 2004. We have been able to maintain
low levels of debt through this sales expansion period by carefully managing working capital and as
a result of our strong cash flow from operations.

The effective income tax rate for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 was 35%, compared with
19% for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. For both the nine-month periods ended December 31,
2005 and 2004 the effective income tax rate was 35%. Effective tax rates for all periods
approximated federal and state statutory rates except for the quarter ended December 31, 2004. The
unusually low effective income tax rate for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 resulted from the
need to revise the annualized projected effective income tax rate.

For the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2005, income from continuing
operations and net income were $560 and $2,613, respectively, or $0.15 and $0.70 per diluted share,
respectively. Loss from continuing operations for the three and nine-month periods ended December
31, 2004 was $90 or $0.03 per diluted share, and $447 or $0.13 per diluted share, respectively.
Net loss for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2004 was $21 or $0.01 per diluted share
and $615 or $0.18 per diluted share, respectively.

The income (loss) from discontinued operations for the three and nine-month periods ended
December 31, 2004 of $69 or $0.02 per diluted share and $(168) or $(0.05) per diluted share,
respectively, represents the operating losses of the United Kingdom subsidiary that
was disposed of in March 2005. There was no loss from discontinued operations in our current
fiscal year.

Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $7,426 for the
nine months ended December 31, 2005, compared with net cash used by operating activities from
continuing operations of $2,465 for the nine months ended December 31, 2004. The change from cash
used by operations to cash provided by operations was primarily due to net income of $2,613 for the
nine months ended December 31, 2005, compared with a net loss from continuing operations of $447
for the nine months ended December 31, 2004, an increase in customer deposits on orders, and
reduced accounts receivable and inventories in the nine months ended December 31, 2005. The
increase in customer deposits was due to increases in major project orders. These orders
customarily require advance payments from customers. We have been able to reduce days outstanding
in accounts receivable through various initiatives implemented over the past nine months. Reduced
inventories were a benefit of lean manufacturing practices initiated over the past several months.
Additionally, the loss of $447 for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 included non-cash other
income of $761 compared with $0 for the nine months ended December 31, 2005. Non-cash income
recognized for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 had previously been collected in advanced
payments.

During the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2005, net cash generated from
operations in excess of cash held for near-term needs was invested in marketable securities.
Investments in marketable securities generally consist of U.S. government instruments with maturity
periods of 91 to 120 days. Investments increased $9,925 over March 31, 2005. Investments
decreased $3,400 from March 31, 2004 to December 31, 2004. The decrease in the prior year was due
to the sale of marketable securities to finance operating cash deficits.

Anticipated uses of cash for the year ending March 31, 2006, include a capital expenditure
program of up to $1,500 and the continued payment of quarterly dividends to stockholders. The
capital expenditure plans include significant expenditures for information technology and software
to enhance engineering and design
productivity. Capital expenditures for the first nine months of the fiscal year ending March
31, 2006 were $927, compared with $53 for the nine months ended December 31, 2004. In October
2005, $2,289 was

contributed to the defined benefit pension plan. With this contribution, the
total amount contributed to the pension plan for the current fiscal year is $3,576. This
additional contribution will enable us to take the maximum income tax deduction permitted under
full funding limitations, reduce future pension expenses and, under the current funding standard,
substantially fund the Plan on an on-going basis.

The sale of 198,246 shares of common stock was completed in November 2005. The shares were
offered pursuant to a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
November 14, 2005. The common stock was sold for $18 per share. These shares were held as
treasury shares before the sale. They were previously acquired at an average price of $7 per
share. In total, the sale netted, after related costs of $150, $3,418 and increased Stockholders 
Equity 18% resulting in a net book value per share of $0.94. The shares were sold to raise
additional capital to support sales growth, diversify the stockholder base, broaden institutional
ownership and provide greater float in the market.

Additionally, cash of $1,294 was generated from the issuance of common stock in conjunction
with the exercise of stock options during the nine months ended December 31, 2005. This compares
with $83 generated from the exercise of stock options in the nine-month period ended December 31,
2004. Other financing activities in the current fiscal year included the retirement of $1,872 in
short-term debt.

We have a credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. for $13,000, borrowings under which are
secured by assets of the Company. We believe that cash from operations and available financing
capacity under the credit facility will be adequate to meet cash needs, including planned capital
spending, in the foreseeable future.

Total cash used by operating activities of the discontinued operation for the nine months
ended December 31, 2004 was $164. The discontinued operation invested $75 in capital expenditures
and used $137 from financing activities. There were no discontinued operation activities in the
current fiscal year.

ORDERS AND BACKLOG 

Orders for the current quarter were $14,337, compared with $13,953 for the quarter ended
December 31, 2004, a 3% increase. Orders for the nine months ended December 31, 2005 were $47,595,
compared with $36,524 for the nine months ended December 31, 2004, a 30% increase. Orders
represent communications received from customers for the supply of products and services. Orders
for surface condensers in the current quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2005 increased 96%
and 58%, respectively, over the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2004. Orders for
ejector products (decreased) increased (7)% and 43% for the three and nine-month periods ended
December 31, 2005 compared with the same respective periods one year ago. Increases in orders are
due largely to the increased demand for products and services coming from major project work in the
petrochemical and refinery sectors. The decrease in ejector orders for the current quarter is
believed to be a temporary situation and attributed to timing of order placements. Export orders
were up 56% and 66% for the respective three and nine-month periods
ended December 31, 2005 compared with the three and nine-month periods ended December 31,
2004. Through December 31, 2005 orders from Asia,

22

Table of Contents   

Mexico and the Middle East for major project
work rose substantially compared with the nine months ended December 31, 2004. Domestic orders
were down 49% in the current three months and 2% in the nine months ended December 31, 2005,
compared with the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2004. In the immediate future,
we anticipate that the receipt of orders from the domestic market will approximate the average
levels experienced for the nine months ended December 31, 2005.

Backlog was $30,278 at December 31, 2005, compared with $22,145 at December 31, 2004. This
represents a 37% increase. Backlog is defined as the total dollar value of orders received for
which revenue has not yet been recognized. All orders in backlog represent orders from traditional
markets in established product lines and are scheduled to be shipped in the next twelve months.
Approximately 40% of the backlog can be attributed to equipment for refinery project work, 46% to
chemical and petrochemical projects, 5% to equipment sold to the power generation sector and 9% to
other industrial or commercial applications. The demand coming from the refinery sector for
equipment is being driven by the shortages of refinery capacity resulting from increased usage of
oil in China and India, the need to upgrade existing refineries so that they can use lower cost,
high sulfur  sour  crude, and the need to revamp refineries to meet environmental regulations in
numerous countries pertaining to diesel fuel sulfur content requirements. Most refineries
presently in operation can only process light,  sweet  (i.e., low sulfur) crude, which is less
abundant and more expensive than heavier  sour  (i.e. high sulfur) crude. Orders from the
petrochemical and power markets are mainly for overseas capacity expansion projects. These orders
reflect the continued economic growth in Asia. In years prior to 2005, there were minimal capital
investments by these sectors, which has also contributed to the present increased demand.

CONTINGENCIES 

We have been named as a defendant in certain lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure
to asbestos contained in our products. We are a co-defendant with numerous other defendants in
these lawsuits and intend to vigorously defend against these claims. The claims are similar to
previous asbestos lawsuits which named us as a defendant, lawsuits either were dismissed when it
was shown that we had not supplied products to the plaintiffs  places of work or were settled for
minimal amounts below the expected defense costs. Neither the outcome of these lawsuits nor the
potential for liability can be determined at this time.

From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to legal proceedings and
potential claims. At December 31, 2005, we were unaware of any additional litigation matters.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard ( SFAS ) No. 151,  Inventory Costs.  SFAS No. 151 amends Accounting
Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4,  Inventory Pricing , to clarify the accounting for abnormal
amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. SFAS No. 151
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet
the criterion of  abnormal  contained in such Statement. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that
allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity
of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 will become effective for inventory costs we incur
during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2007. Although we believe that the adoption of SFAS No.
151 may result in the acceleration of recognizing indirect manufacturing expenses during times of
below normal utilization of plant capacity, we do not anticipate below normal utilization of plant
capacity for the immediate future. We have not yet determined the long-term impact on the
Consolidated Financial Statements of adopting SFAS No. 151.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R),  Share-Based Payment . SFAS No. 123(R)
requires that all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be
recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values for fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2005. In addition, SFAS No. 123(R) will cause unrecognized expense (based on the fair
values determined for the pro forma footnote disclosure, adjusted for estimated forfeitures)
related to options vesting after the date of initial adoption to be recognized as a charge to
results of operations over the remaining vesting period. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) requires
management to choose among various acceptable options in quantifying the compensation expense to be
recognized for options granted. We have decided to use the Black-Scholes fair value model and to
adopt the modified prospective method for expense recognition of options granted as of the adoption
date of April 1, 2006. The modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be
recorded for all unvested stock options and share awards at the beginning of the first quarter of
adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). We believe the initial effect of adopting SFAS 123(R) will be
immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements because all stock options currently issued and
unexercised are fully vested.

In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation ( FIN ) No. 47,  Accounting for Conditional
Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 . FIN No. 47 clarifies
the term  conditional asset retirement obligation  as used in SFAS No. 143,  Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations , and provides further guidance as to when an entity would have sufficient
information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. We adopted
FIN No. 47 in the current quarter. The impact of adopting FIN No. 47 was immaterial to our
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2005 or 2004 other than
operating leases.

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from changes in market rates and
prices) to which we are exposed are:

foreign currency exchange rates; 

equity price risk (related to our Long-Term Incentive Plan for Directors); 

material availability; and 

gross margin risk. 

The assumptions applied in preparing the following qualitative and quantitative disclosures
regarding foreign currency exchange rate and equity price risk are based upon volatility ranges
experienced by us in relevant historical periods, management s current knowledge of the
marketplace, and management s judgment of the probability of future volatility based upon the
historical trends and economic conditions of our business.

FOREIGN CURRENCY 

International consolidated sales for the past three fiscal years were 40% of total sales.
Operating in markets throughout the world, as we do, involves exposure to movements in currency
exchange rates. Currency movements can affect sales in several ways, the foremost being the
ability to compete for orders against competitors who base their prices on relatively weaker
currencies. Business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively
weaker currency cannot be quantified. Secondly, cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion
of sales in foreign currency to U.S. dollars. For the three and nine-month periods ended December
31, 2005 and 2004, we had no sales for which we were paid in foreign currencies. At certain times,
we may enter into forward foreign currency exchange agreements to hedge exposure against
unfavorable changes in foreign currency values on significant sales contracts negotiated in foreign
currencies.

We have limited exposure to foreign currency purchases. For the three-month periods ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004, purchases in foreign currencies represented 1% and 5% of the cost of
products sold, respectively. For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, purchases
in foreign currencies represented 1% and 5% of cost of products sold, respectively. At certain
times, we may utilize forward foreign currency exchange contracts to limit currency exposure.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we held no forward foreign currency exchange contracts.

EQUITY PRICE RISK 

The Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for awards of share equivalent units ( SEUs ) for
outside Directors based upon the performance of our common stock. SEUs are valued at fair market
value, thereby exposing us to equity price risk. Upward adjustment to market value is limited to
(a) $8 per unit if at the valuation date the fair market value was less than $8 per unit or (b) the
fair market value at the valuation date if the fair market value on that
date was greater than $8 per unit. Gains and losses recognized due to market

25

Table of Contents   

price changes
are included in results of operations. Based upon the plan provisions and SEUs outstanding at
December 31, 2005 and 2004 and an $8 per share price, a 50-75% change in the year end common stock
market price would positively or (negatively) impact income from continuing operations before
income taxes as follows:

(Dollar amounts in thousands)

Assuming required net income targets are met, certain awards would be provided, and based
upon a market price of $8 per share, a 50-75% change in the stock price would positively
(negatively) impact income from continuing operations before income taxes in future years ending
March 31 as follows:

(Dollar amounts in thousands)

MATERIAL AVAILABILITY 

Shortages of materials have occasionally affected our ability to meet delivery requirements
for certain orders. We seek to identify alternative vendors in such cases.

GROSS MARGIN RISK 

Operating in a global marketplace requires us to compete with other global manufacturers
which, in some instances, benefit from lower product costs and favorable foreign exchange rates.
Currently we are experiencing rising costs, particularly for healthcare, employment costs, metal
materials and energy. As a larger percent of sales are shipped to Southeast Asia, we may encounter
greater pricing pressures preventing us from fully covering escalating costs. To mitigate these
pressures, we are exploring alternative manufacturing models, increasing investments in information
technology to improve productivity and adopting lean manufacturing principles.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

The President and Chief Executive Officer and the Vice President Finance and Administration
and Chief Financial Officer each have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on these reviews, each has determined such controls are
effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

There have been no changes to internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter
covered by this report that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially
affect, internal control over financial reporting.

(a) 
       
     Designed such disclosure controls
and procedures, or caused such
disclosure controls and procedures
to be designed under our

information relating to the
registrant, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made
known to us by others within those
entities, particularly during the
period in which this report is being
prepared; 

(b) 
       
     Evaluated the effectiveness of the
registrant s disclosure controls and
procedures, and presented in this
report our conclusions about the
effectiveness of the disclosure
controls and procedures as of the
end of the period covered by this
report based on such evaluation; and 

(c) 
       
     Disclosed in this report any change
in the registrant s internal control
over financial reporting that
occurred during the registrant s
most recent fiscal quarter (the
registrant s fourth fiscal quarter
in the case of an annual report)
that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially
affect, the registrant s internal
control over financial reporting;
and 

5. 
       
     The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed,
based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial
reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the
registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent
function): 

(a) 
       
     All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the registrant s ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information;
and 

(b) 
       
     Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant
role in the registrant s internal control over
financial reporting.
