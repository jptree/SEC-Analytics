Independent Accountants' Report

To the Board of Directors
CWCapital Asset Management LLC

We have examined management's assertion about CWCapital Asset Management LLC's
compliance with the minimum servicing standards identified in the Mortgage
Bankers Association of America's Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage
Bankers (USAP) as of December 31, 2005 and for the period from July 14, 2005
through December 31, 2005 included in the accompanying management assertion.
Management is responsible for CWCapital Asset Management LLC's compliance with
those applicable minimum servicing standards. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on management's assertion about the entity's compliance based on our
examination.

Our examination was made in accordance with standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about CWCapital Asset Management LLC's
compliance with the applicable minimum servicing standards and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on CWCapital Asset Management
LLC's compliance with the applicable minimum servicing standards.

In our opinion, management's assertion that CWCapital Asset Management LLC, in
its capacity as Special Servicer, complied with the aforementioned applicable
minimum servicing standards as of December 31, 2005 and for the period from July
14, 2005 through December 31, 2005 is fairly stated, in all material respects,
