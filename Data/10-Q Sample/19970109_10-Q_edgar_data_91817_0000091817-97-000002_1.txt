                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Net  earnings  for the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  1997  increased  37% to
$3,298,000 or $.31 per share on sales of  $58,024,000  compared with last year's
first  quarter net  earnings of  $2,410,000,  net earnings per share of $.25 and
sales of $46,437,000.  There were 9% more shares  outstanding during this year's
first quarter compared to last year.

     For the first  quarter of fiscal 1997,  the  Company's  Fluid  Controls and
Construction Products Segment provided 47% of total sales; the Test, Measurement
and Control Segment,  28% of total sales; and the Farm Equipment Segment, 25% of
sales.  Net sales and earnings  before  income  taxes of the Fluid  Controls and
Construction Products Segment increased 31% and 13%, respectively, compared with
the prior year's first quarter. This segment benefitted from the acquisitions of
CMB  Industries and Davis Filters in the second quarter of fiscal 1996. The Farm
Equipment Segment had a strong performance with sales and earnings before income
taxes  ahead of last  year by 52% and  121%,  respectively,  helped  by both the
strong grain market and favorable acceptance of new products.

     Overall  gross  margins on net sales for the first  quarter of fiscal  1997
improved  to 34.8%  from 33.4% last year as a result of  favorable  product  mix
changes.  Selling,  general and  administrative  expenses  increased to 24.7% of
sales in this year's first quarter from 23.8% last year, primarily due to higher
sales expenses at CMB Industries.  CMB (acquired in the second quarter of fiscal
1996), traditionally has had higher selling expenses than Core due to its higher
distribution costs.

     Interest  expense  declined 6.3% in this year's first quarter compared with
last year due to reduced borrowings.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     At November 29, 1996, the Company had working  capital of $75 million and a
current ratio of 3.2 to 1, and the Company's  capital  employed  (total debt and
equity) amounted to $137 million. The debt to capital ratio improved to 23% from
31% a year ago primarily  due to the Company  exercising  its maximum  allowable
prepayment  options and reducing its 10% rate  long-term debt by $8 million over
the past year.

     The  Company is  negotiating  to  replace  its $20  million  line of credit
facility with a $50 million  unsecured  revolving  credit  facility with a major
domestic  bank.  Although  there  was  only  $1.7  million  in  short-term  bank
borrowings at November 29, 1996, the increased capacity will provide the Company
committed funds to support its growth initiatives.

     Management believes its current cash position,  cash flows from operations,
along with its  borrowing  capacity,  are  adequate to fund its  strategies  for
future  growth,  including  working  capital,   expenditures  for  manufacturing
expansion and efficiencies, new product development, and acquisition activities.
During the first quarter of fiscal 1997, cash flow from operations improved over
$5 million  compared  to last year's  first  quarter,  primarily  due to working
capital  reductions.  At the Company's  current dividend rate of $.06 per share,
annual dividend  payments would  approximate  $2.6 million.  Under the Company's
debt agreement with insurance companies,  retained earnings of approximately $29
million are available for dividends, subject to future earnings levels.
