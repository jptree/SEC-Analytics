FORWARD-LOOKING
      STATEMENTS   

This
      document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of
      Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify such forward-looking
      statements by the words  expects ,  intends,   plans,   projects,   believes, 
 estimates,   likely,   goal,   assume  and similar expressions. In the normal
      course of business, eXegenics Inc. ( eXegenics  or the  Company ), in an effort
      to help keep its stockholders and the public informed about the Company s
      operations may, from time to time, issue such forward-looking statements, either
      orally or in writing. Generally, these statements relate to business plans
      or
      strategies, projected or anticipated benefits or other consequences of such
      plans or strategies, or projections involving anticipated revenues, earnings
      or
      other aspects of operating results. eXegenics bases the forward-looking
      statements on its current expectations, estimates and projections. eXegenics
      cautions you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance
      and
      involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that eXegenics cannot predict.
      In
      addition, eXegenics has based many of these forward-looking statements on
      assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Therefore,
      the
      actual results of the future events described in such forward-looking statements
      in this Annual Report, or elsewhere, could differ materially from those stated
      in such forward-looking statements. Among the factors that could cause actual
      results to differ materially are the risks and uncertainties discussed in this
      Annual Report, including, without limitation, factors discussed in Item 1,
 Business  and Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
      Condition and Results of Operations,  including the factors discussed under the
      caption  Factors That May Affect Financial Condition and Future Results, 
beginning on Page 5.

PART
      I  

Item
      1.      Business   

General  

eXegenics   
      Inc.,
      formerly known as Cytoclonal Pharmaceutics Inc. (the  Company ), was previously
      involved in the research, creation, and development of drugs for the treatment
      and/or prevention of cancer and infectious diseases. We have       historically
      operated as a drug discovery company, exploiting new enabling technologies
      to
      advance and shorten the new drug development cycle. We completed the termination
      of all research activities. All scientific staff and administrative positions
      were eliminated and all of our research and development activities were
      terminated.  

Our
      Board
      and management are focused on redeploying the remaining residual assets of
      the
      Company. The Board has established a committee to study strategic direction
      and
      identify potential business opportunities and the Company s objective continues
      to be to redeploy its assets and actively pursue new business opportunities.

On
      June
      29, 2005 the Company and David E. Riggs mutually agreed that Mr. Riggs would
      relinquish his duties as President, Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer
      of the Company. Chairman of the Board, John A. Paganelli, assumed the role
      of
      Interim Chief Executive Officer. On July 1, 2005 David Hostelley was named
      Chief
      Financial Officer of the Company. 

Patents,
      Licenses and Proprietary Rights  

Prior
      to
      the termination of all of our research and development programs, our policy
      was
      to protect technology that we consider important in the development of our
      business by, among other things, filing patent applications for such technology.
      As we have terminated all drug discovery operations we have not incurred
      expenses in maintaining any of our prior patents. Thus any of our patents may
      be
      subject to challenge and we may lose our rights to such. 

License
      Agreements  

During
      2004 and 2005 we did not receive any revenues from the       Intellectual
      Property Assignment Agreement with NLC Pharma, Inc. The Company did not earn
      any
      revenue under this agreement during 2005, nor does it anticipate receiving
      any
      revenues from this agreement in future years.  

Competition  

As
      we
      have terminated all research and development programs we do not anticipate
      developing any potential products.  

3 

Insurance  

We
      have
      indemnification agreements with our former directors, in addition to the rights
      to indemnification afforded such individuals in our bylaws. The indemnification
      agreements require us to maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance
      covering at the then current levels of coverage for these individuals for a
      period from the date of such agreements until six years after the last date
      on
      which the individual ceases to be a director, officer, employee, agent or
      fiduciary of the Company. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
      obtain, maintain or increase our insurance coverage in the future on acceptable
      terms or that any claims against us will not exceed the amount of such
      coverage. 

Employees  

On
      June
      29, 2005 the Company and David E. Riggs mutually agreed that Mr. Riggs would
      relinquish his duties as President, Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer
      of the Company. Chairman of the Board, John A. Paganelli, assumed the role
      of
      Interim Chief Executive Officer. On July 1, 2005 David Hostelley was named
      Chief
      Financial Officer of the Company. 

We
      engage
      independent contractors and temporary employees to perform certain
      administrative tasks. Although we believe that we have been successful to date
      in attracting skilled, highly qualified personnel, competition for personnel
      is
      intense and we cannot assure that we will be able to attract and retain highly
      qualified personnel. We do not expect any future employees to be governed by
      any
      collective bargaining agreement.  

Factors
      That May Affect Financial Condition and Future Results  

We
      completed the wind down of our drug discovery operations. We continue to be
      focused on redeploying the remaining residual assets of the Company. The
      following cautionary statements discuss important factors that could cause
      actual results to differ materially from the projected results contained in
      the
      forward-looking statements in this report. 

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources  

At
      December 31, 2005 we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of approximately
      $8,901,000. Our future capital needs are uncertain. The Company may or may
      not
      need additional financing in the future to fund any potential transaction the
      Company may enter into, a determination to be made when the Company implements
      its new business strategy. We do not know whether additional financing will
      be
      available when needed, or that, if available, we will obtain financing on terms
      favorable to our stockholders.  

Our
      Stock  

The
      market price of our stock may be negatively affected by market volatility.
      The
      following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section,
      may have a significant impact on the market price of our
      securities: 

-
      announcements we make concerning new business development
      activities; 

-
      announcements we make concerning our use of cash to maintain our dormant
      operations; 

-
      regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries; 

-
      our
      common stock being quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board; 

-
      current
      and new litigation requiring further use of our cash; or  

-
      economic and other external factors or other disasters or crises. 

4 

Research
      and Development Activities  

As
      we
      have terminated all research and development activities we did not incur any
      research and development expenses during fiscal 2005 and 2004 respectively.

Item
      1A.      Risk
      Factors   

The
      risks
      described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks that we do
      not
      yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our
      business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business,
      operating results or financial condition could be materially harmed. Investors
      should also refer to the other information set forth in this Form 10-K,
      including the financial statements and the notes thereto.  

We
      May in the Future make Acquisitions, which Involve Numerous
      Risks         

Our
      objective continues to be to redeploy our assets and actively pursue new
      business opportunities. As such, we will be subject to numerous risks, including
      the following:  

The
                benefits of any potential business opportunity not materializing
                as
                planned or not materializing within the time periods or to the extent
                anticipated;  

The
                possibility that the Company will pay more than the value it derives
                from
                any potential business opportunity;

The
                assumption of certain known and unknown liabilities of any potential
                business opportunity;  

Risks
                of entering markets in which the Company has no or limited direct
                prior
                experience; and  

Any
      business opportunity we pursue will involve a high degree of business and
      financial risk, which can result in substantial losses for us. There is
      generally going to be no publicly available information about the companies
      which we intend to pursue, and we rely significantly on the diligence of our
      employees and agents to obtain information. If we are unable to identify all
      material information about these companies, among other factors, we may fail
      to
      receive the value we had expected. In addition, these businesses may have short
      operating histories, narrow product lines, small market shares and less
      experienced management than their competition and may be more vulnerable to
      customer preferences, market conditions, loss of key personnel, or economic
      downturns. Depending upon the ultimate structure of any such transaction, we
      may
      be subject to the risk that such a company may make a business decision that
      does not prove to be profitable for the Company.  

Our
      search for new business opportunities also may be affected by current and future
      market conditions. In addition, significant changes in the capital markets
      could
      have an effect on the valuations of companies and on the potential for liquidity
      events involving such companies.  

5 

The
      Business Opportunity We Pursue Could Materially and Adversely Affect Our Results
      of Operations and Our Stock Price.        

Even
      if
      we locate a business opportunity, the closing of any such transaction will
      be
      subject to certain conditions, including us obtaining shareholder approval.
      We
      cannot provide assurance that the necessary approvals will be obtained, or
      that
      we will be able to successfully consummate such transaction.  

If
      we do
      not successfully locate a suitable business opportunity:  

the
                market price of our common stock may decline; 

we
                will continue to incur costs, including legal, accounting, financial
                advisory and other costs relating to us being a public company and
                our
                ongoing search for a suitable business opportunity; and 

we
                may experience a negative reaction if we do not locate a suitable
                business
                opportunity, or if the Board of Directors does recommend a proposal
                to our
                shareholders which is not approved, or if such transaction is approved
                by
                our shareholders and does not produce anticipated
                results. 

The
      occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have
      a
      material adverse effect on our results of operations and our stock price.

Any
      Business Opportunity We Pursue May Result in a Change of Control and Our Current
      Management May not Have Any Power to Influence Us After the Closing of any
      such
      Transaction    

Any
      transaction that we engage may result in the owners and management of such
      company having actual or effective operating control of us. The owners and
      management of such company will have the right to appoint their own officers
      and
      directors, and our current management will have no ability to influence future
      business decisions.  

Currently,
      There is No Agreement for Any Potential Transaction and No Minimum Guidelines
      Have Been Established   

The
      Company has no current arrangement, agreement or understanding with respect
      to
      engaging in a transaction with any specific entity. We cannot guarantee that
      the
      Company will be successful in identifying and evaluating any suitable business
      opportunities or in concluding a transaction. We have not selected any
      particular industry or specific business within an industry as a potential
      target company. The Company has not established any criteria, including a
      specific length of operating history or a specified level of earnings, assets,
      and/or net worth, which it will require a company to have achieved, or without
      which the Company would not consider a transaction with such business entity.
      Accordingly, the Company may enter into a transaction with a business entity
      having no significant operating history, losses, limited or no potential for
      immediate earnings, limited assets, negative net worth or other negative
      characteristics. We cannot guarantee you that the Company will be able to
      negotiate a transaction on terms favorable to the Company. 

Any
      Business Opportunity We Pursue Will Possibly Dilute the Value of the Company s
      Securities.   

Any
      transaction we pursue will involve the issuance of a significant number of
      additional shares of the Company's common stock. Depending upon the value of
      the
      business, the per share value of the Company's common stock may increase or
      decrease, perhaps significantly. Any transaction involving the issuance of
      the
      Company's common stock may result in shareholders of a target company obtaining
      a controlling interest in the Company.  

6 

Any
      Transaction We Pursue May Result in Unfavorable Taxation to the Company

Federal
      and state tax consequences will, in all likelihood, be major considerations
      in
      any business opportunity we may pursue. Currently, such transactions may be
      structured so as to result in tax-free treatment to both companies, pursuant
      to
      various federal and state tax provisions. The Company intends to structure
      any
      transaction so as to minimize the federal and state tax consequences to the
      Company. However, there can be no assurance that such business opportunity
      will
      meet the statutory requirements of a tax-free reorganization or that the parties
      will obtain the intended tax-free treatment upon a transfer of stock or assets.
      A non-qualifying reorganization could result in the imposition of both federal
      and state taxes which may have an adverse effect on both parties to the
      transaction and their shareholders. 

Certain
      of the Company s Charter Provisions and Delaware Law May Prevent or Deter
      Potential Business Opportunities    

The
      Company s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended and restated (the
 Certificate of Incorporation ), Bylaws ( Bylaws ) Shareholders Rights
      Agreement, and certain provisions of Delaware law contain certain provisions
      that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing us from
      pursuing a potential business opportunity proposal that a stockholder might
      consider favorable. The anti-takeover effect of these provisions may also have
      an adverse effect on the public trading price of the Company s common stock.

Section
      404 and Other Recently Enacted Regulatory Changes Have Caused, and Will Continue
      to Cause the Company to Incur Increased Costs and Operating Expenses and May
      Make it More Difficult for the Company to Successfully Pursue New Business
      Opportunities   

The
      Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and recently enacted rules of the SEC have caused
      the
      Company to incur significant increased costs as it implements and responds
      to
      new requirements. In particular, the rules governing the standards that must
      be
      met for management to assess its internal controls over financial reporting
      under Section 404 are new and complex, and require significant
      documentation, testing and possible remediation. This ongoing process of
      reviewing, documenting and testing the Company s internal controls over
      financial reporting has resulted in, and will likely continue to result in,
      a
      significant strain on the Company s management, information systems and
      resources. Furthermore, achieving and maintaining compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley
      and other new rules and regulations has required the Company to hire additional
      personnel and has and will continue to require it to use additional outside
      legal, accounting and advisory services.  

Any
      new
      business opportunity pursued by the Company will also put a significant strain
      on its management, information systems and resources, which will require
      implementation of any changes necessary to maintain effective internal controls
      over financial reporting.  

Changes
      in, or Interpretations of, Accounting Rules and Regulations Could Result in
      Unfavorable Accounting Charges    

The
      Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with
      accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
      principles are subject to interpretation by the Securities and Exchange
      Commission (the  SEC ) and various bodies formed to interpret and create
      appropriate accounting policies. A change in these policies can have a
      significant effect on the Company s reported results and may even retroactively
      affect previously reported transactions. 

7 

Our
      Common Stock Price May be Volatile, Which Could Result in Substantial Losses
      for

Our
      corporate offices are located at 1250 Pittsford-Victor Road, Building 200,
      Suite 280, Pittsford, New York 14534. The Company leases this office space
      from RFG Associates, an entity in which John A. Paganelli, chairman of the

      Proceedings   

Labidi
      Proceeding   .
        On
      October 5, 2005, in the matter brought by Abdel Hakim Labidi (one of our former
      employees) against the Company, a jury ruled in favor of Dr. Labidi determining
      that the Company converted certain biological research materials owned by Dr.
      Labidi, and the Company committed theft of biological materials owned by Dr.
      Labidi. The jury awarded Dr. Labidi a total of $600,000. Dr. Labidi has moved
      the Court to award attorney fees and interest on the jury s award. We await a
      decision from the Court on this motion. The Company is reviewing this matter
      to
      determine the validity of appealing the decision of the jury. The final amount
      due by the Company to Dr. Labidi under such judgment is likely to be between
      $250,000 and $750,000, however the Company has provided for a reserve of
      $250,000 in the financial statements.

      7.      Management s
      Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operations   

In
      this section,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
      Results of Operations,  references to  we,   us,   our,  and  ours  refer to
      eXegenics Inc.  

The
      following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in
      its
      entirety by, the Financial Statements and the Notes thereto included in this
      report. This discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that involve
      substantial risks and uncertainties. When used in this report the words
 anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   expect  and similar expressions as they
      relate to our management or us are intended to identify such forward-looking
      statements. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ
      materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking
      statements. Historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of
      the
      trends in operating results for any future period. 

Our
      Board
      is focused on redeploying the remaining residual assets of the Company. The
      Board and management have established a committee to study strategic direction
      and identify potential business opportunities. The lawsuit filed by The M B
      Weiss Family Limited Partnership of 1996 was dismissed on April 12, 2005. The
      Company faces potential liability of at least $600,000 (exclusive of interest
      and legal fees, which have been requested by Dr. Labidi, but not yet determined
      by the Court) in connection with the judgment rendered against the Company
      in
      the lawsuit filed by Dr. Labidi. On June 29, 2005 the Company and David E.
      Riggs
      mutually agreed that Mr. Riggs would relinquish his duties as President, Chief
      Executive and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Chairman of the Board
      John
      A. Paganelli, assumed the role of Interim Chief Executive Officer. On July
      1,
      2005 Dave Hostelley was named Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Our
      objective in 2006 is to redeploy our assets and actively pursue new business
      opportunities. After taking into account the interest earned on our investments
      ($25,000 to $30,000 per month) we expect to use between $40,000 and $55,000
      per
      month in 2006 in furtherance of these objectives. This calculation includes
      $250,000 in the potential liability faced by the Company in the judgment
      rendered against the Company in the suit filed by Dr. Labidi. 

Our
      discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations
      are
      based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
      with
      accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The
      preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and
      judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
      and
      expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an
      on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to
      investments, intangible assets, income taxes, contingencies and litigation.
      We
      base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
      that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
      form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
      liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
      may
      differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Critical
      Accounting Policies  

We
      believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant
      judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.

The
      Company considers all non-restrictive, highly liquid short-term investments
      purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
      equivalents. Investments consist of equity securities and are classified as
      available for sale and reported at their fair values. The realized gains and
      losses from these investments are reported in current earnings. Unrealized
      gains
      and losses from these securities are reported as a separate component of
      stockholders  equity and excluded from current earnings.  

The
      Company has elected to continue to account for its stock-based compensation
      plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles
      Board
      Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees  ( APB No. 25 ) and
      provide pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share disclosures for
      employee stock option grants as if the fair-value based method defined in
      Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, No. 123,  Accounting for Stock
      Based Compensation  had been applied. Under the provisions of APB No. 25,
      compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the
      quoted market price of the Company s common stock at the date of the grant over
      the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock.  

Revenue
      from research support agreements is recognized ratably over the length of the
      agreements. Revenue resulting from contracts or agreements with milestones
      is
      recognized when the milestone is achieved. Amounts received in advance of
      services to be performed, or the achievement of milestones, are recorded as
      deferred revenue. Payments to third parties in connection with nonrefundable
      license fees are being recognized over the period of performance of related
      research and development activities. 

The
      Company periodically evaluates the collectability of the subscription receivable
      and adjusts an allowance sufficient to ensure that the net balance is equal
      to
      the value of the underlying collateral. 

We
      record
      a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that
      is
      more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable
      income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing
      the
      need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we
      would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its
      net
      recorded amount, an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase
      income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine
      that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset
      in the future, an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be charged
      to
      income in the period such determination was made.

As
      a

      2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash disbursements made during fiscal 2004 against
      a previously established restructuring reserve included $90,000 for severance

      an
      increase of $63,000 or 50%. The increase in interest income was due to higher

      in value and ultimate sale of Javelin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. common

      was $0.03 and for fiscal 2004 was $0.13. 

Fiscal
      Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31,

      2004, compared to $13,000 for fiscal 2003, a decrease of $13,000 or 100%. The

15 

Expenses
      Related to Strategic Redirection  

As
      a
      result of our decision to redirect our business strategy, we incurred costs
      of
      $5,000 in expenses from operations terminated in fiscal 2004, Cash disbursements
      made during fiscal 2004 against a previously established restructuring reserve
      included $90,000 for severance payments, $87,000 for terminated operating lease
      obligations, and $16,000 for equipment and facilities relocation. We recognized

      Income  

Interest
      income for fiscal 2004 was $127,000 as compared to $174,000 for fiscal 2003,
      a
      decrease of $47,000 or 27%. The decrease in interest income was due to lower
      interest rates and declining investable balances as disbursements were
      made.    

Net
      Loss  

We
      incurred net losses of $1,926,000 during fiscal 2004 and $5,793,000 during
      fiscal 2003. The decrease in net loss of $3,867,000 or 67% is a result of the
      aforementioned changes in our operations. Net loss per common share for fiscal
      2004 was $0.13 and for fiscal 2003 was $0.38. 

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources  

At
      December 31, 2005 we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of approximately
      $8,901,000. During 2005, we used approximately $1,000,000 to fund our operating
      activities. Restricted cash was pledged as collateral in support of leases
      of
      laboratory equipment. In connection with the termination of our drug discovery
      research programs, we repurchased equipment subject to a capital lease
      agreement. In August 2005, in conjunction with the return of remaining lease
      obligations, the lessor of this equipment released $175,000 of the held
      collateral. In addition, in 2005 the Company received proceeds of approximately
      $1,064,000 from the sale of Javelin Pharmaceuticals, Inc shares of common stock.

The
      Company faces potential liability of at least $600,000 (exclusive of interest
      and legal fees, which have been requested by Dr. Labidi, but not yet determined
      by the Court) in 2006 in connection with the judgment rendered against the
      Company in the lawsuit filed by Dr. Labidi. In connection with this potential
      liability the Company has recorded a reserve for $250,000. 

After
      taking into account the interest earned on our investments ($25,000 to $30,000
      per month) we expect to use between $40,000 and $55,000 per month in 2006 in
      furtherance of these objectives. This calculation includes $250,000 in the
      potential liability faced by the Company in the judgment rendered against the
      Company in the suit filed by Dr. Labidi. Our future capital needs are uncertain.
      The Company may or may not need additional financing in the future to fund
      operations, a determination to be made when the Company adopts its new business
      strategy. We do not know whether additional financing will be available when

Recent
      Accounting Pronouncement  

We
      believe that the adoption of the following accounting standard will not have
      a
      material impact on our financial statements. 

16 

In
      December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R,  Share-based Payment.  SFAS No.
      123R is a revision of SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock Based Compensation ,
      and supersedes APB 25. Among other items, SFAS 123R eliminates the use of APB
      25
      and the intrinsic value method of accounting, and requires companies to
      recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of
      equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards, in
      the
      financial statements. The effective date of SFAS 123R is January 1, 2006, for
      calendar year companies. 

SFAS
      123R
      permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a  modified
      prospective  method, or a  modified retrospective  method. Under the  modified
      prospective  method, compensation cost recognized in the financial statements
      beginning with the effective date, based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for
      all share-based payments granted after that date, and based on the requirements
      of SFAS 123 for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of
      SFAS
      123R. Under the  modified retrospective  method, the requirements are the same
      as under the  modified prospective  method, but also permits entities to restate
      financial statements of previous periods based on proforma disclosures made
      in
      accordance with SFAS 123. 

Off
      Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The
      Company has no off balance sheet arrangements. 

Item
      7A.      Quantitative
      and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

Our
      exposure to financial market risk, including changes in interest rates, relates
      primarily to our marketable security investments. We generally place our
      marketable security investments in high credit quality instruments, primarily
      U.S. government obligations and corporate obligations with contractual
      maturities of less than one year. We do not believe that a 100 basis point
      increase or decrease in interest rates would significantly impact our business.
      We do not have any derivative instruments. We operate only in the United States
      and all our transactions have been made in U.S. dollars. We do not have any
      material exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Option
      Grants in Our Last Fiscal Year   

The
      following table shows grants of stock options that we made during the fiscal
      year ended December 31, 2005 to each of our executive officers named in the
      Summary Compensation Table, above.  

(1) 

The
                options are non-qualified stock options, granted pursuant to the
                Company s
                Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Option Plan. Options to purchase
                20,000
                shares of Common Stock, at an average exercise price of $0.40 per
                share,
                vest immediately on the grant date that ranges from January 1, 2005
                through October 1, 2005. These options were granted to Mr. Paganelli
                as a
                member of the Board of Directors of the
                Company. 

(2) 

In
                accordance with the rules of the SEC, we show in these columns the
                potential realizable value over the term of the option (the period
                from
                the grant date to the expiration date). We calculate this assuming
                that
                the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant appreciates
                at the indicated annual rate, 5% and 10% compounded annually, for
                the
                entire term of the option and that the option is exercised and sold
                on the
                last day of its term for the appreciated stock price. These amounts
                are
                based on assumed rates of appreciation and do not represent an estimate
                of
                our future stock price. Actual gains, if any, on stock option exercises
                will depend on the future performance of our common stock, the option
                holder s continued employment with us through the option exercise period,
                and the date on which the option is
                exercised. 

Aggregated
      Option Exercises in Last Fiscal Year and Fiscal Year-End Option
      Values  

The
      following table shows information regarding exercises of options to purchase
      our
      common stock by each former executive officer named in the Summary Compensation
      Table during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005   .
         The
      table
      also shows the aggregate value of options held by each executive officer named
      in the Summary Compensation Table as of December 31, 2005. The value of the
      unexercised in-the-money options at fiscal year end is based on a value of
      $0.41
      per share, the closing price of our stock on the OTC Bulletin Board     on
      December 30, 2005 (the last trading day prior to the fiscal year end), less
      the
      per share exercise price.

Employment
      Contracts, Termination of Employment and Change-in-Control
      Arrangements  

David
      E.
      Riggs entered into an employment agreement with us on March 10, 2003 to serve
      as
      our Vice President, Chief Business Officer, Chief Financial Officer and
      Secretary until March 9, 2006, to be automatically renewed for additional
      one-year periods, unless sooner terminated. The employment agreement provides
      for the payment to Mr. Riggs of a base salary of $235,000 per year with an
      annual bonus payment of up to 30% of Mr. Riggs s base salary, at the discretion
      of the Board of Directors. The employment agreement provides that in the event
      Mr. Riggs s employment is terminated by us without cause or by Mr. Riggs for
      good reason, Mr. Riggs shall receive severance payments of equal monthly
      installments at the then current base rate until either (i) the expiration
      of 12
      months following the date of termination, if such date is prior to March 10,
      2004, (ii) the expiration of nine months following the date of termination,
      if
      such date is before March 10, 2005, (iii) the expiration of six months following
      the date of termination, if such date is before March 9, 2006, or (iv) the
      expiration of six months following the date of termination, if such date is
      during a renewal period. The employment agreement contains a one-year
      post-termination non-compete, non-solicitation and non-disclosure agreement.
      On
      or about March 2004 we amended Mr. Riggs employment agreement (the  Amendment )
      to reflect his title of President and Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to
      the
      Amendment Mr. Riggs was granted an option to purchase 75,000 shares of the
      Company s Common Stock. This Option granted vests in three equal installments:
      The first immediately upon the grant date, the second on the first anniversary
      of that date and the final upon the second anniversary of that date. Effective
      June 30, 2005 the Company and David E. Riggs mutually agreed that Mr. Riggs
      would relinquish his duties as President, Chief Executive and Chief Financial
      Officer of the Company, and the Company entered into a Separation Agreement
      with
      Mr. Riggs. Chairman of the Board, John A. Paganelli, assumed the role of Interim
      Chief Executive Officer. On July 1, 2005 David Hostelley was named Chief
      Financial Officer of the Company. The Company s agreement with Mr. Hostelley
      calls for him to receive $2,500 per month, and is terminable by either side
      upon
      30 days written notice.

   Security
      Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder
      Matters   

The
      table
      below shows the number of shares of our common stock and series A preferred
      stock beneficially owned as of March 28, 2006 by the following
      persons: 

each
                stockholder known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of the
                outstanding shares of either the common stock or series A preferred
                stock; 

each
                current member of the Board of Directors;

our
                Interim Chief Executive Officer and our single highly compensated
                executive officers who earned more than $100,000 during the fiscal
                year
                ended December 31, 2005 referred to below as our named executive
                officer;
                and,  

all
                directors and named executive officer as a group.

To
      our
      knowledge and unless otherwise indicated, each person in the table has sole
      voting power and investment power, or shares such power with his or her spouse,
      with respect to all shares of capital stock listed as owned by such person.
      The
      Company is not aware of any arrangements which may at a subsequent date result
      in a change of control of the Company. 

The
      number of shares beneficially owned by each stockholder is determined under
      the
      rules promulgated by the SEC. The information is not necessarily indicative
      of
      beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Under these rules, beneficial
      ownership includes any shares as to which the individual has sole or shared
      voting power or investment power and any shares as to which the individual
      has
      the right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days after March 21, 2006
      through the exercise of any option, warrant or other right. The inclusion in
      the
      following table of those shares, however, does not constitute an admission
      that
      the named stockholder is a direct or indirect beneficial owner of those
      shares.

        of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  

To
        the
        Board of Directors 

        and
        Stockholders 

        eXegenics
        Inc. 

We
        have
        audited the accompanying balance sheet of eXegenics Inc. as of December 31,
        2005, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders'
        equity,
        and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the
        responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express
        an
        opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. 

We
        conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
        statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
        on a
        test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
        statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
        and
        significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
        financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
        reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In
        our
        opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
        material respects, the financial position of eXegenics Inc. as of December
        31,
        2005 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then
        ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
        United
        States of America.

Board
        of

         eXegenics   
        Inc. 

We
        have
        audited the accompanying balance sheets of    eXegenics   
        Inc.
        (the Company) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related statements
        of
        operations, changes in stockholders  equity and cash flows for the years then
        ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s
        management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
        statements based on our audits. 

We
        conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
        financial statements are free of material   misstatement.
        The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit
        of
        its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration
        of internal control over financial  
        reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate
        in the
        circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
        effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
        Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining,
        on a
        test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
        statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
        made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
        presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
        opinion. 

In
        our
        opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
        material respects, the financial position of    eXegenics   
        Inc. as
        of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of its operations and its
        cash
        flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles

        A   The Company  

eXegenics   
        Inc.,
        formerly known as Cytoclonal Pharmaceutics Inc. (    eXegenics    
or
        the

Note
        B   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Cash
        equivalents, restricted cash   

The
        Company considers all non-restrictive, highly liquid short-term investments
        purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
        equivalents. Cash equivalents, which amount to $8,901,000 and $8,734,000
        at
        December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, consist principally of interest
        bearing cash deposits. Restricted cash, amounted to $0 at December 31, 2005,
        and
        $175,000 at December 31, 2004, consisted of certificates of deposits that
        are
        used as collateral for equipment leases.  

The
        Company maintains cash and cash equivalents at several financial institutions
        which periodically may exceed federally insured amounts. The Company has
        not
        experienced any loss in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any
        significant risk on cash and cash equivalents. 

Marketable
        Securities      

The
        Company accounts for marketable securities in accordance with Statement of
        Financial Accounting Standards No. 115  Accounting for Certain Investments in
        Debt and Equity Securities  ( SFAS 115 ). SFAS 115 establishes the accounting
        and reporting requirements for all debt securities and for investments in
        equity
        securities that have readily determinable fair values. All marketable securities
        must be classified as one of the following: held-to-maturity,
        available-for-sale, or trading. The Company classifies its marketable securities
        as available-for sale and, as such, carries the investments at fair value,
        with
        unrealized holding gains and losses reported in stockholders  equity as a
        separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The cost of
        securities sold is determined based on the specific identification method.
        Realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other than
        temporary, are included in investment income. 

In
        2001,
        the Company entered into a planned merger agreement that was subsequently
        terminated as a part of a negotiated settlement, it received a convertible
        subordinated promissory note in the amount of $500,000. In September 2003,
        this
        note was converted to 339,736 shares of Innovative Drug Delivery System ( IDDS )
        series C preferred stock and as of December 31, 2003, the Company had placed
        a
        full valuation allowance on the value of these securities. In late December
        2004, the Company was informed that Intrac, Inc. acquired IDDS and all of
        the
        Company s shares in IDDS were to be converted to 345,991 shares of Intrac, Inc.
        common stock. As of December 31, 2004 the fair value of the Company s investment
        in these securities was equal to approximately $1,124,000 and a corresponding
        unrealized gain is included as a component of other comprehensive
        income. 

During
        2005, the Company sold all of its marketable securities, realizing a gain
        on
        sale of approximately $1,064,000. These securities consisted of equity
        securities (common stock) in Javelin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formally known
        as
        Intrac, Inc.) and were classified as available for sale and reported at their
        fair values. Realized gains and losses from the sale of investments are reported
        in current earnings. Unrealized gains and losses from these securities are
        reported as a separate component of stockholders equity and excluded from
        current earnings. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the fair
        value
        of the Company s investments was equal to approximately $0 and $1,124,000 with
        corresponding unrealized gains in 2004 included as a component of other
        comprehensive income.  

Equipment   

Equipment
        is stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method
        over
        the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 5 years.
        Repairs
        and maintenance that do not increase the economic useful life of the asset
        are
        charged to expense as incurred. 

The
        Company reviews its capital assets for impairment whenever events or changes
        in
        circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In
        performing the review, the Company uses the undiscounted cash flow method.

F-7 

Revenue
        recognition   

Revenue
        from research support agreements is recognized ratably over the length of
        the
        agreements. Revenue resulting from contracts or agreements with milestones
        is
        recognized when the milestone is achieved. Amounts received in advance of
        services to be performed or the achievement of milestones are recorded as
        deferred revenue. 

Research
        and development   

Research
        and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.  

Loss
        per common share   

Basic
        and
        diluted loss per common share is based on the net loss increased by dividends
        on
        preferred stock divided by the weighted average number of common shares
        outstanding during the year. No effect has been given to outstanding options,
        warrants or convertible preferred stock in the diluted computation, as their
        effects would be anti-dilutive. The number of potentially dilutive securities
        excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share was approximately
        2,148,000, 2,325,000 and 3,739,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005,
        2004
        and 2003, respectively. 

Stock-based
        compensation   

The
        Company accounts for stock- based compensation according to Accounting
        Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and the related interpretations under Financial
        Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 44, "Accounting for
        Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation." The Company adopted the
        required disclosure provisions under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
        No. 148 and continues to use the intrinsic value method of accounting for
        stock-based compensation. 

Comprehensive
        Income   

SFAS
        No.
        130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income," establishes standards for the reporting
        and display of comprehensive income and its components within the financial
        statements. Other comprehensive income is comprised of charges to stockholders'
        equity, other than contributions from or distributions to stockholders, excluded
        from the determination of net income. The Company's other 

        comprehensive
        income is comprised of unrealized gains on available for sale marketable
        securities. 

Income
        Taxes   

The
        Company has applied the provisions of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income
        Taxes," which requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and
        liabilities for the consequences of temporary differences between amounts
        reported for financial reporting and income tax purposes, including net
        operating loss carryforwards. SFAS No. 109 requires recognition of a future
        tax
        benefit of net operating loss carryforwards and certain other temporary
        differences to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely
        than
        not; otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied. 

Fair
        value of financial instruments   

The
        carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued expenses
        approximates their fair value due to the short period to maturity of these
        instruments. 

Use
        of estimates   

The
        preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
        generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
        make
        estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
        liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
        of
        the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
        during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
        estimates.

Recent
        Accounting Pronouncement   

In
        May
        2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Statement Accounting Standards
        No.
        154,  Accounting Changes and Error Corrections-a replacement of APB Opinion No.
        20 and FASB Statement No. 3  ( SFAS 154 ). This Statement replaces APB Opinion
        No. 20,  Accounting Changes,  and FASB Statement No. 3,  Reporting Accounting
        Changes in Interim Financial Statements.  SFAS 154 requires retrospective
        application to prior periods  financial statements for changes in accounting
        principle, unless it is impractical to determine either the period-specific
        effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that
        a
        change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long,
        non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate
        effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for
        accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning
        after December 15, 2005. The Company believes that adoption of the provisions
        of
        SFAS 154 will not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial
        statements. 

In
        December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R,  Share-based Payment.  SFAS No.
        123R is a revision of SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock Based Compensation ,
        and supersedes APB 25. Among other items, SFAS 123R eliminates the use of
        APB 25
        and the intrinsic value method of accounting, and requires companies to
        recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of
        equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards, in
        the
        financial statements. The effective date of SFAS 123R is January 1, 2006,
        for
        calendar year companies. 

SFAS
        123R
        permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a  modified
        prospective  method, or a  modified retrospective  method. Under the  modified
        prospective  method, compensation cost recognized in the financial statements
        beginning with the effective date, based on the requirements of SFAS 123R
        for
        all share-based payments granted after that date, and based on the requirements
        of SFAS 123 for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of
        SFAS
        123R. Under the  modified retrospective  method, the requirements are the same
        as under the  modified prospective  method, but also permits entities to restate
        financial statements of previous periods based on proforma disclosures made
        in
        accordance with SFAS 123. 

The
        Company currently utilizes a standard option pricing model (i.e., Black
        -Scholes) to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees.
        While
        SFAS 123R permits entities to continue to use such a model, the standard
        also
        permits the use of a  lattice  model. The Company has not yet determined which
        model it will use to measure the fair value of employee stock options upon
        the
        adoption of SFAS 123R. 

SFAS
        123R
        also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess
        of
        recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather
        than
        as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement
        will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows
        in
        periods after the effective date. These future amounts cannot be estimated
        because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock
        options. 

Note
        C   License Agreements  

On
        September 8, 2004 the Company entered into an Intellectual Property
        Assignment Agreement to license the Company s QCT drug discovery technology to
        NLC Pharma, Inc. (a Delaware corporation based in Israel). Pursuant to the
        Agreement the Company will receive monies from royalties, licenses or the
        sale
        of QCT technology to third parties that are generated by NLC Pharma Inc.
          The
          Company
        did not earn any revenue under this agreement during 2005, nor does it
        anticipate receiving any revenues from this agreement in future years.

Preferred
        stock   

On
        January 6, 1992, the Board of Directors designated 4,000,000 shares of preferred
        stock as Series A convertible preferred stock. The holders of Series A preferred
        stock are entitled to (i) convert on a one-for-one basis to common stock
        subject
        to adjustment, as defined, (ii) voting rights equivalent to voting rights
        of
        common stockholders, (iii) receive dividends equal to $.25 per share payable
        on
        or about January 15 each year in cash or newly-issued shares of Series A
        preferred or a combination thereof (iv) liquidation preferences of $2.50
        per
        preferred share. The Company, at its option, has the right to redeem all
        or any
        portion of the Series A convertible preferred stock at $2.50 per share plus
        accrued and unpaid dividends. 

During
        January 2003, the Company elected to pay the required yearly dividend on
        its
        Series A convertible preferred stock by issuing additional shares of Series
        A
        convertible preferred stock. The Company issued 82,834 shares of Series A
        convertible preferred stock to satisfy the 10% dividend. In addition, during
        2003, 20,293 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock were converted
        into
        20,293 shares of common stock. 

During
        January 2004, the Company elected to pay the required yearly dividend by
        issuing
        additional shares of Series A convertible preferred. The Company issued 89,020
        shares to satisfy the 10% dividend. In addition, during 2004, 44,252 shares
        of
        Series A convertible preferred were converted into 44,252 shares of common
        stock 

During
        January 2005, the Company elected to pay the required yearly dividend by
        issuing
        additional shares of Series A convertible preferred. The Company issued 93,502
        shares to satisfy the 10% dividend. In addition, during 2005, 75,995 shares
        of
        Series A convertible preferred were converted into 75,995 shares of common
        stock. 

Common
        Stock   

During
        the second quarter 2004, the Board of Directors adopted a resolution providing
        for the issuance of shares of the Company s common stock and the granting of
        stock options as part of compensation paid to directors for their service
        to the
        Company. Upon joining the Board, directors are issued 25,000 shares of common
        stock. The chairman of the Board receives an additional 25,000 shares at
        the
        time he assumes this role. Members of the Board of Directors are granted
        an
        option to purchase 5,000 shares of the Company s common stock on the first day
        of each calendar quarter, with an exercise price equal to the closing trading
        price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. In the second quarter
        2004, the Chairman of the Board was issued 50,000 shares of common stock,
        Directors were issued 25,000 shares. In the aggregate, 150,000 shares of
        common
        stock were issued and recorded at their fair value on the date of grant.
        No
        common stock was issued to the Board of Directors in 2005.

Stockholder
        Rights Plan   

On
        June
        9, 2003, the then current Board of Directors adopted a shareholders rights
        plan.
        Under the plan, each holder of the Company s common stock as of the close of
        business on June 9, 2003 received, as a non-taxable dividend, one right for
        each
        share of common stock held. Each right entitles the holder to purchase from
        the
        Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series B Junior Participating Preferred
        Stock at an exercise price of $4.50, subject to adjustment. If a person or
        group
        acquires beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of the Company s common
        stock, each right will entitle its holder (other than the acquiring person
        or
        members of the acquiring group) to purchase, at the right's then current
        exercise price (initially $4.50), a number of the Company s shares of common
        stock having a market value of twice such price (initially $9.00). 

In
        addition, if the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination
        transaction after a person has acquired beneficial ownership of 15 percent
        or
        more of its common stock, each right will entitle its holder to purchase,
        at the
        rights' then current exercise price (initially $4.50), a number of the acquiring
        company's shares of common stock having a market value of twice such price
        (initially $9.00). Following the acquisition by a person or group of beneficial
        ownership of 15 percent of the Company s common stock and prior to an
        acquisition of beneficial ownership of 50 percent or more of its common stock
        the Board of Directors may exchange the rights (other than rights owned by
        such
        acquiring person or group, which will have become null and void and
        nontransferable), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one share
        of
        common stock (or one-thousandth of a share of Series B Junior Participating
        Preferred Stock) per right. The Company may redeem the rights at a price
        of
        $.001 per right at any time prior to the time a person has become the beneficial
        owner of 15% or more of the Company s outstanding common stock. The rights will
        expire on June 9, 2013, unless earlier exchanged or redeemed. 

Subscriptions
        receivable   

In
        May
        2001, we sold 100,000 shares of common stock to our former President and
        Chief
        Executive Officer, Ronald L. Goode, Ph.D., for a purchase price of $3.25
        per
        share, the fair market value at the time of the transaction. Dr. Goode paid
        the
        purchase price of $325,000 with $25,000 in cash and issued a $300,000 five-year
        promissory note to us bearing interest at a rate of 4.71% per annum, with
        interest payable semi-annually. The 100,000 shares sold to Dr. Goode, serve
        as
        collateral to secure the note. The note provides that in the event of a default
        on the note, as defined in the agreement, Dr. Goode s obligation to the Company
        is limited to $65,000 and proceeds from the public sale of the collateralizing
        stock. Through December 31, 2004, Dr. Goode has made $86,000 in interest
        payments. A stock certificate for these shares was not issued to Dr. Goode
        until
        September 2003. In February 2004, Dr. Goode resigned, thereby terminating
        his
        employment agreement with the Company and in 2005 he has failed to make $14,000
        in interest payments. In the second quarter 2005, the Company recorded a
        reserve
        against the subscription receivable balance so that the net balance is
        approximately equal to Dr. Goode s obligation under the note. 

Warrants   

At
        December 31, 2005, outstanding warrants to acquire shares of the Company s
        common stock are as follows  :  

On
        August
        13, 2002 the Company issued warrants to purchase 125,000 shares of its common
        stock at a purchase price of $1.00 per share, with an expiration date of
        August
        13, 2007, and additional warrants to purchase 125,000 shares of our common
        stock
        at a purchase price of $0.55 per share, with an expiration date of August
        13,
        2007 to Roan/Meyers Associates, L.P. in exchange for financial advisory
        services. In connection with this exchange, the Company recorded a charge
        of
        $91,000 to operations during 2002 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
        model.

In
        March
        2003, the Company entered into an agreement with Petkevich   Partners, LLC
        whereby the Company issued warrants to purchase 40,000 shares of common stock
        at
        $0.58 per share expiring on March 5, 2008. These warrants vested during 2003;
        the Company determined the fair value based on the Black-Scholes option pricing
        model of these warrants to be approximately $5,000, which was charged to
        operations during 2003. 

The
        Company did not incur any warrant related expenses in 2004 and
        2005.

Stock
        options   

During
        1996, the Board of Directors and the stockholders of the Company approved
        the
        1996 Stock Option Plan (the  1996 Plan ) that provides for the granting of
        incentive and nonstatutory options for up to 750,000 shares of common stock
        to
        officers, employees, directors and consultants of the Company. During 1998,
        the
        Board of Directors and the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment
        to
        the Plan to allow for the granting of an additional 750,000 options. At December
        31, 2005 and 2004, 980,000 and 922,000, respectively, options were available
        for
        future grant under the 1996 Plan. 

During
        2000, the Board of Directors and the stockholders of the Company approved
        the
        2000 Stock Option Plan (the  2000 Plan ), which provides for the granting of
        incentive and nonstatutory options for up to 1,500,000 shares of common stock
        to
        officers, employees, directors, independent contractors, advisors and
        consultants of the Company. The Company subsequently amended the 2000 plan
        to
        increase the options available for future grants by 1,250,000 shares and
        to
        change the vesting period. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, 2,365,000 and
        1,820,000, respectively, options are available for grant under the 2000
        Plan. 

Options
        granted under the Plans are exercisable for a period of up to 10 years from
        date
        of grant at an exercise price which is not less than the fair value of the
        common stock on date of grant, except that the exercise period of options
        granted to a stockholder owning more than 10% of the outstanding capital
        stock
        may not exceed five years and their exercise price may not be less than 110%
        of
        the fair value of the common stock at date of grant. For the 1996 Plan, options
        generally vest 40% after six months of employment and thereafter 20% annually
        on
        the anniversary date of the grant. For the 2000 Plan, as a result of an
        amendment approved by the stockholders in 2001, the vesting period changed
        from
        50% annually on the anniversary date of the grant, to 33 1/3% annually on
        the
        anniversary date of the grant. Under the 2000 plan, the Board of Directors
        has
        authority to modify the vesting period. Non-employee director options are
        immediately exercisable on the date of grant. 

Stock
        option activity under the Plans are summarized as follows: 

The
        following table presents information relating to stock options outstanding
        under
        the plans as of December 31, 2005: 

Pro
        forma
        information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by SFAS
        No.
        123, and has been determined as if we accounted for our stock option grants
        under the fair market value method as prescribed by such statement. The fair
        market value of our stock options was estimated at the date of grant using
        the
        Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions. 

F-12 

The
        weighted average fair value at date of grant for options granted during 2005,
        2004 and 2003 was $0.40, $0.81, and $0.09 per option, respectively. The Company
        accounts for stock- based compensation according to Accounting Principles
        Board
        Opinion No. 25 and the related interpretations under Financial Accounting
        Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 44, "Accounting for Certain
        Transactions Involving Stock Compensation." The Company adopted the required
        disclosure provisions under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
        148
        and continues to use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock-based
        compensation. 

The
        Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
        the
        fair market value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and
        are
        fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input
        of
        highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.
        Because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from
        those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions
        can materially affect the fair market value estimates, in management s opinion,
        the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure
        of the
        fair market value of our stock options. 

Note
        H   Income Taxes  

At
        December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had approximately $53,080,000 and
        $51,041,000 of net operating loss carry forwards and $491,000 and $521,000
        of
        research and development credit carry forwards, respectively, for federal
        income
        tax purposes that expire in years 2006 through 2022. 

At
        December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had a deferred tax asset of
        approximately $18,541,000 and $19,521,000 respectively, representing the
        benefits of its net operating loss and research and development credit carry
        forwards and certain expenses not currently deductible for tax purposes,
        principally related to the granting of stock options and warrants, and non-cash
        reorganization and merger expenses. The Company s deferred tax asset has been
        fully reserved by a valuation allowance since realization of its benefit
        is
        uncertain. The difference between the statutory tax rate of 34% and the
        Company s effective tax rate is principally due to the increase (decrease) in
        the valuation allowance of ($980,000) (2005), $644,000 (2004), and $1,902,000
        (2003). The Company s ability to utilize its carry forwards may be subject to an
        annual limitation in future periods pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal
        Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

        upon thirty (30) days notice. Rent expense, prior to any reorganization expense,
        was approximately $11,000, $20,000, and $238,000 for the years ended December
        31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 

Legal
        Proceedings   

Weiss
        Litigation.   

On
        May 15, 2003, The M B Weiss Family Limited Partnership of 1996 filed a
        lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly as a class action
        on
        behalf of all other similarly situated stockholders of the Company, against
        the
        Company, as a nominal defendant,       and
        former directors: Joseph M. Davie, Robert J. Easton, Ronald L. Goode and
        Walter
        Lovenberg, (collectively referred to as the  Individual Defendants ), and
        purportedly as a derivative action on behalf of the Company       against
        the Individual Defendants (the  Weiss Litigation ).   On
        April
        12, 2005 the judge, in a ruling from the bench, dismissed the matter with
        prejudice.  

F-13 

Labidi
        Proceeding   .

On
        October 5, 2005, in the matter brought by Abdel Hakim Labidi (one of our
        former
        employees) against the Company, a jury ruled in favor of Dr. Labidi determining
        that the Company converted certain biological research materials owned by
        Dr.
        Labidi, and the Company committed theft of biological materials owned by
        Dr.
        Labidi. The jury awarded Dr. Labidi a total of $600,000. The Company is
        reviewing this matter to determine the validity of appealing the decision
        of the
        jury. The final amount due by the Company to Dr. Labidi under such judgment
        is
        likely to be between $250,000 and $750,000, however the Company has recorded
        a
        provision of $250,000 in the financial statements. 

2110
        Research Row, Ltd. Proceeding   .

On
        December 31, 2003, the termination date of our lease agreement, we vacated
        19,300 square feet of office and laboratory space that we occupied at 2110
        Research Row, Dallas, Texas. 2110 Research Row, Ltd. (the  Landlord ) acquired
        this property in April 2002. The Landlord contends he is owed payments that
        we
        believe to be outside the terms of the lease agreement or waived by the previous
        landlord. In October 2003, we filed suit against the Landlord and 9000
        Harry Hines, Inc., in a Dallas County District Court. The Company, as tenant,
        and the Landlord were parties to a lease agreement ( Lease Agreement ) dated
        October 1, 1991, as amended.  On March 19, 2004, we entered into
        a settlement agreement with the Landlord, whereby we made a $33,000 payment
        to
        the Landlord, dismissed the suit with prejudice and entered into a mutual
        release of any and all claims by all parties. On April 9, 2004, the
        Landlord and the Company filed an Agreed Order Of Dismissal With Prejudice
        in
        The District Court, 134   th   
        Judicial
        District, Dallas County Texas.  

Employment
        agreements   

David
        Hostelley  

On
        July
        1, 2005 David Hostelley was named Chief Financial Officer of the Company.
        The
        Company s agreement with Mr. Hostelley calls for him to receive $2,500 per
        month, and his employment is terminable by either side upon written
        notice. 

Related
        party transactions   

John
        Paganelli  

In
        January 2004, the Company entered into a lease agreement for office space
        with
        RFG Associates, an entity in which John A. Paganelli, chairman of the Board
        of
        Directors of the Company is an equity owner. The lease provides for a monthly
        rent of $625 and is cancelable by either party upon thirty (30) days notice.

Note
        J   401(k) Plan  

The
        Company had maintained a defined contribution 401(k) plan available to eligible
        employees but discontinued this plan during 2003. Employee contributions
        were
        voluntary and were determined on an individual basis, limited to the maximum
        amount allowable under federal tax regulations. The Company made no
        contributions during 2005, 2004, and 2003. 

Note
        K   Quarterly Results (Unaudited)  

(a) 

Per
                  common share amounts for the quarters and full year have been calculated
                  separately. Accordingly, quarterly amounts may not add to the annual
                  amount because of differences in the weighted average common shares
                  outstanding during each period due to the effect of the Company s issuing
                  shares of its common stock during the
                  year.
