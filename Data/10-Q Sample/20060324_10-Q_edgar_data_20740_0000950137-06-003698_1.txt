      CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

The consolidated condensed balance sheet as of March 4, 2006, the consolidated condensed
statements of earnings and the consolidated condensed statements of cash flows for the periods
ended March 4, 2006, and February 26, 2005, have been prepared by the Company without audit.
The financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as those in the Company s December
3, 2005 annual report on Form 10-K (2005 Form 10-K). The November 30, 2005 consolidated balance
sheet data was derived from CLARCOR s year-end audited financial statements as presented in the
2005 Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal
recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of
operations, and cash flows have been made. The results of operations for the period ended March
4, 2006 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year. 

As discussed in the 2005 Form 10-K, at year end 2005 the Company revised its presentation of
short-term investments on its Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows, which were previously presented as cash and cash equivalents in previous years, to
present them in accordance with their contractual maturities. The amount revised in the
Consolidated Condensed Statement of Cash Flows totaled $5,100 for first quarter 2005. The
purchases and sales related to the investments held have been presented on the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows in the operating activities section. This revision had no impact on
the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 

2. 
       
      STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  

Effective December 4, 2005, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123R,  Share-Based Payment  (SFAS No. 123R), using the modified prospective transition method.
Under this method, stock-based compensation expense is recognized using the fair-value based
method for all awards granted on or after the date of adoption. Compensation expense for
unvested stock options and awards that were outstanding on December 4, 2005 will be recognized
over the requisite service period based on the grant-date fair value of those options and awards
as previously calculated under the pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123. The Company
determined the fair value of these awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
Company also adopted the non-substantive vesting period approach for attributing stock
compensation to individual periods for awards with retirement eligibility options, which
requires recognition of compensation expense immediately for grants to retirement eligible
employees or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved.
This change will not affect the overall amount of compensation expense recognized and had an
immaterial effect on the amount recorded in the three months ended March 4, 2006. Prior to
adoption, the Company used the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,  and related Interpretations and provided the
disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123 applying the nominal vesting period approach.
Therefore, the Company did not recognize compensation expense in association with options
granted. 

As a result of adopting the standard, the Company recorded pretax compensation expense related
to stock options of $411 and tax benefits of $146. This reduced net earnings by $265 and
diluted earnings per share (EPS) by less than $0.01 for the first quarter 2006. The Company
also recorded $221 in pretax compensation expense related to its restricted share

units. The tax benefits associated with tax deductions that exceed the amount of compensation
expense recognized in the financial statements was $903 for the three months ended March 4,
2006. This reduced cash flows from operating activities and increased cash flows from financing
activities compared to amounts that would have been reported if the standard had not been
adopted. 

On November 18, 2005, the Board of Directors approved a grant of 386,375 options that were fully
vested on the date of grant. Approximately $3,000 of pretax compensation expense was included
in the determination of pro forma earnings during 2005 that otherwise would have been recorded
as stock option expense in accordance with SFAS No. 123R over future years had the options been
granted with a four-year vesting period similar to prior grants. On March 22, 2005, the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved accelerating the vesting of
nonqualified stock options granted on December 12, 2004 to current employees, including
executive officers. All of these options had an exercise price greater than the then-market
price per share and provided for vesting at the rate of 25% per year beginning on the first
anniversary of the date of grant. Approximately $3,000 of pretax compensation expense was
included in the determination of pro forma earnings during 2005 that otherwise would have been
recorded as stock option expense in accordance with SFAS No. 123R over future years. Together
these events reduced the amount of pre-tax compensation that would have been recorded related to
these two grants in the three months ended March 4, 2006 by approximately $375. 

If the Company had determined compensation expense for its stock-based compensation plans based
on the fair value at the grant dates for the prior fiscal year, the Company s pro forma net
earnings and basic and diluted EPS would have been as follows: 

The following is a description and summary of the key provisions of the stock-based
compensation plans. 

On March 24, 2003, the shareholders of CLARCOR approved the 2004 Incentive Plan, which replaced
the 1994 Incentive Plan on its termination date of December 14, 2003. The 2004 Incentive Plan
allows the Company to grant stock options, restricted stock and performance awards to officers,
directors and key employees of up to 3,000,000 shares. Upon share option

exercise or restricted share unit conversion, the Company
issues new shares unless treasury shares are available. 

Stock Options  

Under the 2004 Incentive Plan, nonqualified stock options may only be granted at the fair market
value at the date of grant. All outstanding stock options have been granted at the fair market
value on the date of grant. The Company s Board of Directors determines the vesting
requirements for stock options at the time of grant and may accelerate vesting as occurred
during 2005. Excluding the grants awarded in fiscal 2005, options granted to key employees vest
25% per year beginning at the end of the first year; therefore, they become fully exercisable at
the end of four years. Vesting may be accelerated in the event of retirement, disability or
death of a participant or change in control of the Company. Options granted to non-employee
directors vest immediately. All options expire ten years from the date of grant unless
otherwise terminated. The options granted in fiscal 2005 are fully vested as discussed above. 

The following table summarizes the activity for the three months ended March 4, 2006 under the
nonqualified stock option plans and includes options granted under both the 1994 Incentive Plan
and the 2004 Incentive Plan.

2. 
       
      STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (Continued)  

The following table summarizes information about the options at March 4, 2006. 

At March 4, 2006, the aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable was
$47,979 and $43,345, respectively. 

The weighted average fair value per option at the date of grant for options granted in first
quarter 2006 and 2005 was $9.32 and $6.77, respectively. The fair value of each option grant is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions. The expected life selected for options granted during the quarter
represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on
historical data of option holder exercise and termination behavior. Expected volatilities are
based upon historical volatility of the Company s monthly stock closing prices over a period
equal to the expected life of each option grant. The risk-free interest rate was selected based
on yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term
of the options being valued. 

Restricted Share Unit Awards  

The Company s restricted share unit awards are considered nonvested share awards as defined
under SFAS No. 123R. No restricted share units were granted during the three months ended March
4, 2006. During the three months ended February 26, 2005, the Company granted 32,144 restricted
units of Company common stock with a fair value of $26.08 per unit, the respective market price
of the stock at the date granted. The restricted share units require no payment from the
employee and compensation cost is recorded based on the market price

on the grant date and is recorded equally over the vesting period of four years. During the
vesting period, officers and key employees receive compensation equal to dividends declared on
common shares. Upon vesting, the employee may elect to defer receipt of their shares.
Compensation expense related to vesting of restricted stock awards totaled $221 and $229 for the
three months ended March 4, 2006 and February 26, 2005, respectively. The following table
summarizes the restricted share unit awards. 

The total fair value of shares vested during the three months ended March 4, 2006 and February
26, 2005 was $727 and $689, respectively. As of March 4, 2006, there was $1,591 of total
unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements. Of
this nonvested cost, $542 is expected to be recognized during the remainder of fiscal 2006 and
the remaining $1,049 during fiscal years 2007, 2008 and 2009. 

Employee Stock Purchase Plan  

The Company sponsors an employee stock purchase plan which allows employees to purchase stock at
a discount. Effective January 1, 2006, the plan was amended to be in compliance with the safe
harbor rules of SFAS No. 123R so that the plan is not compensatory under the new standard and no
expense will be recognized. The company received $1,143 and $1,108, for the issuance of stock
under this plan during first quarter 2006 and 2005, respectively. 

3. 
       
      EARNINGS PER SHARE   

Diluted earnings per share reflects the impact of outstanding stock options and restricted share
units as if exercised during the periods presented using the treasury stock method. The
following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators utilized in the
calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

3.  EARNINGS PER SHARE (Continued) 

Options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of the common shares
during the respective quarter were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per
share. For the three months ended March 4, 2006, 5,050 options with a weighted average exercise
price of $34.16 were excluded from the computation. For the three months ended February 26,
2005, there were no options excluded. 

For the three months ended March 4, 2006, exercises of stock options added $1,969 to capital in
excess of par value.

5. 
       
      ACQUISITION   

As discussed in the 2005 Form 10-K, on November 1, 2005, the Company acquired Martin Kurz   Co.,
Inc. (MKI), a privately-owned Mineola, New York manufacturer of sintered porous metal laminates
used in screening and filtration products for a wide array of industries, including
pharmaceutical, petrochemical, aerospace, paper and chemical process industries, for
approximately $24,621 net of cash received, including acquisition expenses. During the first
quarter 2006, the Company paid an additional $206 related to a working capital adjustment. This
payment, along with a revised estimate of liabilities assumed, increased goodwill by $96. The
preliminary purchase price was paid in cash with available funds. MKI s sales for the most
recent twelve months prior to acquisition were approximately $12,000. The acquisition would not
have significantly affected net earnings and earnings per share of the Company for prior fiscal
years. MKI was acquired to expand the Company s product line and technical capabilities in
filter manufacturing, primarily for manufacturing of metal filters. The Company expects the
acquisition to be accretive to earnings per share in fiscal year 2006. MKI is included in the
Industrial/Environmental segment from the date of acquisition. 

The excess of the initial purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The initial purchase price
was based on the net assets of the business acquired as shown on an October 31, 2005, balance
sheet which is subject to a final adjustment. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price
over the preliminary estimated fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets
acquired for MKI resulted in $9,210 recorded as goodwill. In addition based on a preliminary
appraisal, the Company recognized $8,600 for customer relationships that will be amortized over
twelve years, $267 as indefinite-lived trademarks and $1,700 as other acquired intangibles which
will be amortized over five to ten years. The preliminary allocation for MKI will be finalized
when the Company completes its estimates of liabilities assumed, completes an appraisal of the
assets acquired and finalizes the purchase price with the sellers. The Company expects to do
this in fiscal 2006. Following is a preliminary condensed balance sheet based on fair values of
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

      ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES  

The following table reconciles the activity for goodwill by reporting unit for the three months
ended March 4, 2006. 

The following table summarizes acquired intangibles by reporting unit. Other acquired
intangibles includes parts manufacturer regulatory approvals, patents and noncompete agreements. 

Amortization expense is estimated to be $2,109 in 2006, $2,016 in 2007, $1,831 in 2008,
$1,831 in 2009 and $1,826 in 2010. 

7. 
       
      GUARANTEES AND WARRANTIES  

The Company has provided letters of credit totaling approximately $24,603 to various government
agencies, primarily related to industrial revenue bonds, and to insurance companies and other
entities in support of its obligations. The Company believes that no payments will be required
resulting from these accommodation obligations. 

In the ordinary course of business, the Company also provides routine indemnifications and other
guarantees whose terms range in duration and often are not explicitly defined. The Company does
not believe these will have a material impact on the results of operations or financial
condition of the Company. 

The Company has a majority ownership interest in a consolidated affiliate in which the Company
has agreed, under certain conditions, to buy out the minority owners  interest for an amount
estimated not to exceed $1,800 as of March 4, 2006. In accordance with SFAS No. 150,
 Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity , the Company has recorded this amount at its fair value in other long-term liabilities.

      GUARANTEES AND WARRANTIES (Continued)  

Warranties are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet and as charges to current expense
for estimated normal warranty costs and, if applicable, for specific performance issues known to
exist on products already sold. The expenses estimated to be incurred are provided at the time
of sale and adjusted as needed, based primarily upon experience. 

Changes in the Company s warranty accrual during the quarter ended March 4, 2006 are as follows: 

8. 
       
      RETIREMENT BENEFITS  

The Company provides various retirement benefits, including defined benefit plans and
postretirement health care plans covering certain current and retired employees in the U.S. and
abroad. Components of net periodic benefit cost and company contributions for these plans were
as follows:

(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 
(Unaudited) Continued 

8. 
       
      RETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued)  

The Company s policy is to contribute to the qualified U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans at least
the minimum amount required by applicable laws and regulations, to contribute to the
nonqualified plan when required for benefit payments, and to contribute to the postretirement
benefit plan an amount equal to the benefit payments. There is no minimum required contribution
for the U.S. pension plans for 2006. The Company from time to time makes contributions in
excess of the minimum amount required as economic conditions warrant. The Company has not
determined whether it will make a voluntary contribution to the U.S. qualified plan in 2006;
however it does expect to fund $280 for the U.S. nonqualified plan, $220 for the non-U.S. plan
and $280 for the postretirement benefit plan to pay benefits during 2006. 

9. 
       
      CONTINGENCIES  

The Company is involved in legal actions arising in the normal course of business.
Additionally, the Company is party to various proceedings relating to environmental issues. The
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and/or other responsible state agencies have
designated the Company as a potentially responsible party (PRP), along with other companies, in
remedial activities for the cleanup of waste sites under the federal Superfund statute. 

Although it is not certain what future environmental claims, if any, may be asserted, the
Company currently believes that its potential liability for known environmental matters does not
exceed its present accrual of $50. However, environmental and related remediation costs are
difficult to quantify for a number of reasons, including the number of parties involved, the
difficulty in determining the extent of the contamination, the length of time remediation may
require, the complexity of the environmental regulation and the continuing advancement of
remediation technology. Applicable federal law may impose joint and several liability on each
PRP for the cleanup. 

It is the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel that additional
liabilities, if any, resulting from these legal or environmental issues, are not expected to
have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or consolidated results of
operations. 

In the event of a change in control of the Company, termination benefits may be required for
certain executive officers and other key employees. 

10. 
       
      SEGMENT DATA  

The Company operates in three principal product segments: Engine/Mobile Filtration,
Industrial/Environmental Filtration, and Packaging. The segment data for the three months
ended March 4, 2006 and February 26, 2005, respectively, are shown below. Net sales represent
sales to unaffiliated customers as reported in the consolidated condensed statements of
earnings. Intersegment sales were not material.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: FIRST QUARTER OF 2006 COMPARED WITH FIRST QUARTER OF 2005.

CLARCOR reported record sales, operating profit and net earnings for the first quarter of 2006.
Sales increased 8.6%, operating profit increased 22.7% and net earnings increased 23.2% over the
same quarter in 2005. Selling and administrative expenses for first quarter 2006 includes stock
option expense of $411,000 that reduced net earnings by $265,000 and diluted earnings per share by
less than $0.01. This additional 2006 expense is due to the first quarter 2006 adoption of new
accounting rules for stock-based compensation.

Net sales of $213,183,000 increased from $196,261,000 reported for the first quarter of 2005.
International sales increased at a higher rate than domestic sales in the quarter due to strong
demand for specialty filtration products and for heavy-duty filters sold through aftermarket
distribution. Sales from acquisitions completed after the first quarter of 2005 added
approximately $3,100,000 to first quarter 2006 sales. Fluctuations in foreign currency rates did
not have a material impact on the 2006 quarter.

The Engine/Mobile Filtration segment reported increased sales of 9.5% to $91,032,000 from
$83,129,000 in 2005. This increase was primarily due to additional sales of heavy-duty filters
through domestic and international aftermarket distribution, OEM dealers and national accounts and
sales to railroads and railroad equipment maintenance companies. In addition, sales of dust
collector cartridges sold through the segment s direct sales force also increased from the prior
year quarter. New product introductions, the breadth of the segment s filter product line and
continued expansion of aftermarket distribution were key drivers of sales growth.

The Company s Industrial/Environmental Filtration segment recorded a 5.6% overall increase in sales
to $102,656,000 for the 2006 quarter from $97,198,000 for the 2005 first quarter. Included in the
sales increase is approximately $3,100,000 from acquisitions completed after the first quarter of
2005. Sales increased, both domestically and internationally, in several markets including HVAC,
air quality equipment, aviation and process liquid. Sales levels in the 2006 quarter were lower
for filtration products used in oil and gas drilling applications. The Company expects that sales
of oil and gas filters will grow in future quarters as recent sales quoting activities have
increased. The segment s first quarter sales growth includes new product introductions, expanded
distribution and increased customer demand for specialty filtration products, including increased
spending on capital goods.

The Packaging segment reported sales of $19,495,000 compared to $15,934,000 in 2005. Sales
increases for the quarter were primarily related to new product introductions and increases in both
metal and plastic packaging products for confectionery, food and personal care products.

Operating profit for the first quarter of 2006 was $25,873,000 compared to $21,080,000 in 2005, a
22.7% increase. The operating profit increase resulted primarily from sales growth in each
business segment, continued cost reduction programs in each segment and approximately $700,000 due
to acquisitions since the first quarter of 2005.

The Engine/Mobile Filtration segment recorded an operating profit increase in 2006 of 13.7%
compared to first quarter 2005. This increase resulted primarily from sales growth, cost reduction
programs and favorable capacity utilization. The segment s operating margin was 21.0% compared

to 20.2% recorded in the first quarter of 2005. Price increases initiated during 2005 have offset
higher costs of purchased materials, freight and energy. Additional pricing changes are expected
to be made if additional cost increases are incurred.

The Industrial/Environmental Filtration segment reported operating profit of $5,485,000 in 2006
compared to $3,969,000 in 2005. Approximately $700,000 of the additional profit is attributed to
acquisitions completed since the first quarter of 2005. Operating profit also improved related to
sales increases of higher margin specialty filtration products and equipment that offset reduced
operating profit due to lower sales of oil and gas drilling filtration products. The segment s
operating margin improved to 5.3% compared to 4.1% in the 2005 quarter.

The Packaging segment s operating profit in the 2006 quarter was $1,315,000 compared to $333,000 in
2005. The improvement resulted primarily from improved sales levels of metal packaging products
and cost reduction programs initiated over the last two years. Price increases to customers offset
cost increases incurred for purchased materials, freight and energy.

Net other expense for the 2006 quarter of $41,000 included interest expense of $188,000 and
interest income of $300,000. Net other income for the 2005 quarter of $312,000 included interest
expense of $143,000 and interest income of $114,000. Interest expense is lower in 2006 due to
reduced debt levels and interest income increased due to higher interest rates and higher levels of
cash and short-term investments.

Earnings before income taxes and minority interests for the first quarter of 2006 totaled
$25,832,000, compared to $20,768,000 in the comparable quarter last year. The provision for income
taxes in 2006 was $9,520,000 compared to $7,536,000 in 2005. The effective rate was 36.9% in 2006
and 36.3% in 2005. The first quarter 2006 effective rate increased due to changes in the amount of
certain deductible expenses. The Company expects that the overall effective tax rate for the
remainder of fiscal 2006 will be approximately 35.5% to 36.0% and is lower in part due to the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

Net earnings in the first quarter of the current year were $16,201,000, or $0.31 per share on a
diluted basis. Net earnings in the first quarter of 2005 were $13,154,000, or $0.25 per share on a
diluted basis. Diluted average shares outstanding were 52,498,939 at the end of the first quarter
of 2006, an increase of 0.3% from the average of 52,321,798 for the 2005 quarter. The increase was
due primarily to additional stock option grants in 2005 offset by 368,200 shares repurchased in
2005 under a stock repurchase program.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash provided by operating activities decreased to $5,720,000 in first quarter 2006 compared to
$16,421,000 in 2005, primarily due to increased investment in short-term investments, primarily
highly liquid variable-rate demand notes, in the 2006 quarter. As discussed in the 2005 Form 10-K,
at year end 2005 the Company revised its presentation of short-term investments on its Consolidated
Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, which were previously presented as cash
and cash equivalents, to present them in accordance with their contractual maturities. The amount
revised in the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Cash Flows totaled $5,100 for first quarter
2005. The purchases and sales related to the investments held have been presented on the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the operating activities section. Due to the first quarter
2006 adoption of new accounting rules for stock-based compensation, cash flow provided by operating
activities was reduced by $903,000 due to tax benefits associated with tax

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, Continued 

deductions that exceed the amount of compensation expense recognized in net earnings. For first
quarter 2006, cash flows for investing activities totaled $3,104,000 and included $2,906,000 used
for plant asset additions. In the 2005 quarter, $3,575,000 was used for additions to plant assets.
Cash flows used in financing activities included net payments of $18,000 on debt agreements and
$3,499,000 used for dividend payments. Cash flow used in financing activities increased by
$903,000 due to a change in reporting of tax benefits due to new stock-based accounting rules.

Cash flows used in financing activities of $14,270,000 in 2005 included net payments of $8,202,000
on debt agreements and dividend payments of $3,281,000.

CLARCOR believes that its current operations will continue to generate cash and that sufficient
lines of credit remain available to fund current operating needs, pay dividends, fund planned
capital expenditures, and provide for interest payments and required principal payments related to
the Company s debt agreements. There were no borrowings at the end of first quarter 2006 on a $165
million multicurrency revolving credit facility. The credit facility also includes a $40 million
letter of credit subline, against which $8,491,000 had been issued at the end of first quarter
2006. Other long-term debt, primarily industrial revenue bonds, totaled $16,236,000 at the end of
the 2006 quarter and related principal payments in 2006 will be approximately $237,000. The
Company is in compliance with all covenants related to debt agreements.

The Company expects to continue to use future additional cash flow for dividends, capital
expenditures and acquisitions. Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2006 are expected to be
approximately $25 million to $30 million and will be used primarily for normal facility
improvements, productivity improvements, expansion of manufacturing and technical facilities, and
to support new products. In the first quarter of 2006 the Company did not repurchase any shares
under a Board of Directors approved stock repurchase program. Future repurchases under the
remaining authorized amount of $139.5 million will depend on cash flow requirements for internal
growth, capital expenditures, acquisitions and the market price of the Company s common stock.

The following table summarizes the Company s fixed cash obligations for the years ending November
30:

The Company s off-balance sheet arrangements relate to various operating leases. The Company had
no derivative, swap, hedge, variable interest entity or special purpose entity agreements during
2006 or 2005. 

The Company s financial position at the end of the first quarter reflected cash and short-term
investments of $38,255,000, an increase from $28,902,000 at year-end 2005. At the end of first
quarter 2006 compared to year-end 2005, accounts receivable were reduced by $2,943,000 primarily
due to lower sales in the first quarter of 2006 compared to the fourth quarter of 2005.
Inventories increased $7,804,000 from the year-end level due to inventory requirements for
increased shipments expected for the remainder of 2006. The changes in accounts receivable and
inventories at the end of the first quarter were consistent with the normal seasonality changes
between fiscal quarters. The current ratio at the end of the first quarter was 3.0 compared to 2.7
at

the end of fiscal 2005. The ratio of total debt to total capitalization was 3.1% at the end of the
2006 first quarter compared to the year-end 2005 level of 3.3%. At the end of the first quarter
2006, CLARCOR had 51,781,566 shares of common stock outstanding. 

OTHER MATTERS 

Market Risk 

The Company s interest income on short-term investments and interest expense on long-term debt are
sensitive to changes in interest rates. In addition, changes in foreign currency exchange rates
may affect assets, liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated
in foreign currencies. Market risks are also discussed in the Company s Form 10-K for the year
ended November 30, 2005 (2005 Form 10-K) in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operation. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The Company s critical accounting policies, including the assumptions and judgments underlying
them, are disclosed in the Company s 2005 Form 10-K in Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operation. These policies have been consistently applied in all
material respects. While the estimates and judgments associated with the application of these
policies may be affected by different assumptions or conditions, the Company believes the estimates
and judgments associated with the reported amounts are appropriate in the circumstances. 

Outlook 

Continued sales growth for the Company overall is expected for the remainder of 2006.
Engine/Mobile segment sales are expected to grow due to increased aftermarket distribution, sales
to OEM dealers and sales of new products. Sales are expected to increase for the
Industrial/Environmental segment as a result of several initiatives including new product
introductions along with continued growth for specialty filtration products including air quality
equipment and aviation related products. Sales growth is also expected for the Packaging segment
for 2006. 

In January 2006 the Company announced that a major customer of the Industrial/Environmental segment
planned to manufacture, at their non-U.S. plants, certain products that the segment currently sells
to the customer manufactured at the segment s domestic plants. This reduction in sales and
operating profit is expected to begin during the second quarter. In 2006, the Company expects to
lose sales totaling approximately $11 million and operating profit could be reduced by
approximately $2 million. 

As a result of the anticipated overall sales growth for the Company combined with continued cost
control efforts, it is expected that diluted earnings per share for 2006 will be in the $1.52 to
$1.60 range. This range includes an estimate of $0.03 related to the expense that will be recorded
for stock-based compensation beginning with the Company s first quarter 2006 adoption of SFAS No.
123R. 

Continued emphasis on cost reductions and price changes within each business unit are expected to
offset costs that have or may increase for freight, energy and purchased materials. These costs 

Page 19

for the Company may change significantly based on future changes in the U.S. and world economies.
Capital investments will continue to be made in each segment s facilities to improve productivity
and to support new products. While the Company fully anticipates that sales and profits will
improve as a result of sales initiatives and cost reductions, the Company has developed contingency
plans to reduce discretionary spending if unfavorable economic conditions persist.
CLARCOR continues to assess acquisition opportunities, primarily in related filtration businesses.
It is expected that these acquisitions would expand the Company s market base, distribution
coverage or product offerings.

Part I   Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

The Company has established disclosure controls and procedures which are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Norman E.
Johnson, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer and Bruce A. Klein,
Vice President   Finance and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of March 4, 2006. Based on their
evaluation, they concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were
effective in achieving the objectives for which they were designed. No change in the
Company s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the Company s most
recent fiscal quarter ended March 4, 2006 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
