Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)   

1. Basis
of Presentation   

Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc.
(the   Company  , which may be
referred to as   we, us   or   our  ) prepared the consolidated financial
statements following accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States (GAAP) for interim financial information and the requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As permitted under those rules,
certain footnotes or other financial information required by GAAP for complete
financial statements have been condensed or omitted. The balance sheet as of December 31,
2004 has been presented for a better understanding of the impact of seasonal
fluctuations on our financial condition.  

In management s opinion,
the financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments that are
considered necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position and
operating results. The results for the three-month period ended December 31,
2005 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the
twelve months ending September 30, 2006 ( 2006 ).  

The Company s fiscal year
ends on the close of business on the last Saturday in September of each
year. Except for the fourth quarter of 2005, each of the Company s 2006 and
2005 quarters ends on the last day of the respective third calendar month.  

We completed our initial
public offering ( IPO ) on September 22, 2004 and received the net IPO
proceeds on September 28, 2004. In connection with the associated early
retirement of debt paid with the proceeds, we recorded a $0.9 million loss in
the first quarter of 2005.  

On December 16,
2005, the Company sold two million shares of common stock at $27.50 per share
in a public offering. Selling stockholders also sold shares in the offering. The
net proceeds to the Company from this offering, after all associated expenses, totaled
approximately $51.6 million and were used for the pay down of revolver
borrowings. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sales by the
selling stockholders.  

You should also read the
financial statements and notes included in our 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The accounting policies used in preparing these financial statements are the
same as those described in that Annual Report.  

2.
Earnings Per Share   

We calculate basic income
per share by dividing the net income by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share includes the dilutive effects
of stock awards. As discussed in Note 1, the Company sold two million
additional shares of common stock in December 2005.  

The following table
reflects the calculation of weighted-average shares outstanding for each period
presented:

3.
Stock-Based Compensation   

Effective September 25,
2005, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS )
123R,   Share-Based Payments  , using
the modified prospective transition method.  Prior to 2006, the Company
accounted for stock awards granted to employees under the recognition and
measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,   Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
Interpretations  .  As a result, no compensation expense was
previously recognized for stock options granted to employees after the Company s
IPO because all such stock options granted had exercise prices equal to the
market value of the Company s stock on the date of the grant.  

Under the modified
prospective transition method, compensation expense recognized in the first
quarter included: (a) compensation cost for all unvested share-based awards
granted prior to September 25, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated
in accordance with SFAS 123,   Accounting For Stock-Based
Compensation,   and (b) compensation cost for all share-based awards
granted subsequent to September 24, 2005, based on the grant date fair
value estimated in accordance with SFAS 123R. Results of prior periods have not
been restated. SFAS 123R also requires the Company to estimate forfeitures in
calculating the expense related to stock-based compensation.  In addition,
SFAS 123R requires the Company to reflect the benefits of tax deductions in
excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as both a financing cash
inflow and an operating cash outflow upon adoption. The excess tax benefit
classified as a financing activity would have been classified as an operating
inflow if the company had not adopted SFAS 123R.  

Compensation cost arising
from stock options granted to employees and non-employee directors is
recognized as expense using the straight-line method over the vesting period.
As of December 31, 2005, there was $5.8 million of total unrecognized compensation
cost related to stock options.  That cost is expected to be recognized
over a period of 2.8 years.  For the three months ended December 31,
2005, the Company s total stock-based compensation expense was $0.6 million ($0.4
million net of tax).  Included in this total stock-based compensation
expense was incremental expense of $0.2 million ($0.1 million net of tax) for
options granted during the quarter ended December 31, 2005. The effect of
adopting SFAS 123R on net income and net income per share was not material.  

The following table
illustrates the effect (in thousands, except per share amounts) on net income
and earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2004 as if
the Company s stock-based compensation had been determined based on the fair
value at the grant dates for awards made prior to 2006, under those plans and
consistent with SFAS 123R:

The fair value of each
option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants issued in
the first quarter of 2006 and 2005:  

Expected life of the
options granted and expected volatilities are based on the expected life and historical
volatilities of the stocks of comparable public companies and other factors.  An estimated annual forfeiture rate of 8.0%
was utilized in valuing the options granted in the first quarter of 2006 and
2005.  

The following table
summarizes stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2005 as well as
activity during the three months then ended:  

At December 31,
2005, the weighted-average remaining contractual life of options outstanding
and exercisable was 7.6 years and 6.7 years, respectively.  

At December 31,
2005, the aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and options
exercisable was $39.4 million and $36.3 million, respectively.  (The intrinsic
value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of the
underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option.)  The
weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted during the
three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $12.67 and $7.85,
respectively.  The intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the
three months ended December 31, 2005 was $5.6 million.  There were no options exercised during the
three months ended December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2005, the
Company had $4.1 million of excess tax benefits available for deferred tax
write-offs related to option accounting.  

4.
Comprehensive Income   

Comprehensive income
consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting stockholders 
equity that, under GAAP, are excluded from net income In our case, these
consist of foreign currency translation gains or losses as follows:

5.
Acquisitions   

SDI Holding, Inc.    

On October 14, 2005,
we purchased 100% of the outstanding stock of SDI Holding, Inc. ( Shelter ),
a distributor of roofing and other building products with 51 branches in 14 states
at the time of the acquisition. This purchase was funded through our U.S.
revolving line of credit.Based upon Shelter s final performance for the 2005
calendar year, the sellers may also qualify for an earn-out payment of up to
$10 million, which would be payable during the second quarter of the Company s
2006 fiscal year. Shelter had net sales of $342.4 million (unaudited) for the
year ended December 31, 2005. We have included the results of operations
for Shelter from the date of acquisition and applied preliminary purchase
accounting as of the date of acquisition, which resulted in recorded goodwill
of $71.4 million as follows (in 000 s):  

Supplemental Pro
Forma Information - Unaudited  

The unaudited pro forma
summary information below for the quarters ended December 31, 2005 and December 31,
2004,  gives effect to the acquisition of
Shelter as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of those periods
and is after giving effect to certain adjustments, including amortization of
the intangibles subject to amortization and related income taxes. The unaudited
pro forma summary information is not necessarily indicative of the financial
results that would have occurred if the Shelter acquisition had been
consummated at the beginning of those quarters, nor is it necessarily
indicative of the financial results which may be attained in the future.  

The proforma summary
information is based upon available information and upon certain assumptions
that the Company s management believes are reasonable. As mentioned above, the Shelter
acquisition is being accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The
allocation of the purchase price is preliminary. Final amounts could differ
from those reflected in the pro forma summary information and such differences
could be significant.

per share data)  

  (Unaudited)  

Easton
Wholesale, Inc.    

On November 23,
2005, we purchased certain assets of Easton Wholesale, Inc. ( Easton ), a
distributor of building products located in Easton, Maryland.  This purchase was funded through our U.S.
revolving line of credit. Easton had net sales of $9.3 million (unaudited) for
the year ended December 31, 2004. We have included the results of
operations for Easton from the date of acquisition and applied preliminary
purchase accounting as of the date of acquisition, which resulted in recorded
goodwill of $2.2 million and $1.3 million of other intangible assets.  

Commercial
Supply, Inc.    

On September 1,
2005, we purchased certain assets of Commercial Supply, Inc. ( CSI ), a
distributor of building products located in western Massachusetts.  This purchase was funded through our U.S.
revolving line of credit. CSI had net sales of $1.4 million (unaudited) for the
year ended December 31, 2004. We have included the results of operations
for CSI from the date of acquisition and applied preliminary purchase
accounting as of the date of acquisition, which resulted in recorded goodwill
of $421 and $314 of other intangible assets.

Insulation
Systems, Inc. of Virginia    

On April 26, 2005,
we purchased certain assets of Insulation Systems, Inc. of Virginia ( ISI ),
a distributor of roofing and other building products with two branches in
Virginia. This purchase was funded through our U.S. revolving line of credit.
ISI had net sales of $19 million (unaudited) for the year ended December 31,
2004. We have included the results of operations for ISI from the date of
acquisition and applied preliminary purchase accounting as of the date of
acquisition, which resulted in recorded goodwill of $3.3 million and $1.3
million of other intangible assets.  

JGA Corp     .   

On December 15,
2004, we purchased 100% of the outstanding stock of JGA Corp. ( JGA ), a
distributor of roofing and other building products with eight branches in
Georgia and Florida at the time of our acquisition. This purchase was funded
through our U.S. revolving line of credit. JGA had net sales of $74 million
(unaudited) for the year ended December 31, 2003. We have included the
results of operations for JGA from the date of acquisition and applied purchase
accounting as of the date of acquisition, which resulted in recorded goodwill
of $9.7 million and $11.4 million of other intangible assets.

6. Stock
Options   

During the first three
months of 2006, we granted options to purchase 374,125 shares of common stock
under our 2004 Stock Plan at a closing price of $27.95 per share on the date of
the grant (see also Note 3).  We also
issued 128,447, 100,000 and 10,389 shares of common stock under exercises of
options under our 1998 Stock Plan, special CEO option agreement and 2004 Stock
Plan, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, there were remaining options
to purchase 1,412,058 shares of common stock available for grant under the 2004
Stock Plan.  

7. Debt   

Effective
October 14, 2005, the Company and its lenders in connection with the
purchase of Shelter (Note 5) amended and restated the senior secured credit
facilities (revolving lines of credit and term loans). The amendment extends
the maturity date of the facilities to October 14, 2010, lowers the
interest rates charged, increases the revolving lines of credit and term loans
to totals of $230 and $80 million, respectively, and extends the installment schedule of
the term loans so that the final payment is due on October 14, 2010. In
addition, the amendment expands the criteria for acquisitions which do not
require lender consent and includes an option of increasing the revolving lines
of credit by an additional $50 million (see Note 10). The amendment also
increased the amount of allowed annual capital expenditures to 1.5% of net
sales.  

The
borrowings under the amended facilities continue to be collateralized by
substantially all of the Company s assets and are subject to certain operating
and financial covenants, which, among other things, restrict the payment of
dividends. The senior secured credit facilities have numerous restrictive
covenants, including required fixed charge coverage ratios.  

8.
Foreign Sales   

Foreign (Canadian) sales
totaled $25.5 million in the three months ended December 31, 2005 and
$25.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2004.  

9. Financial Derivatives   

The Company enters into interest rate derivative agreements, commonly
referred to as swaps or collars, with the objective of reducing volatility in
our borrowing costs.  At December 31,
2005, we had one interest rate collar effectively converting the variable LIBOR
component on a portion of our term loans to a fixed rate.  That collar has a notional amount of $75
million, expires in November 2008, and has a floor rate of 4.33% and a cap rate
of 5.85%.  The fair market value of the
agreement resulted in a liability of approximately $0.2 million at December 31,
2005, which was determined based on current interest rates and expected
trends.  Since these instruments do not
quality as hedges, changes in the unrealized gain or loss are recorded in
interest expense.  The differentials to
be paid or received under the terms of the agreement are accrued as interest
rates change and are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense related to
the debt.  In January 2006, we entered
into another interest rate collar with a notional amount of $75 million that
expires in January 2008 and has a floor rate of 4.54% and cap rate of 5.09%.  

10.
Subsequent Events   

In January 2006, the
Company purchased certain assets of C S Roofing Materials, Inc., doing
business as Pacific Supply Company ( Pacific ), a west coast distributor of
roofing and other building products, and Mississippi Roofing Supply, Inc.
( MRS ) and Alabama Roofing Supply, LLC ( ARS ), affiliated companies which
distribute roofing and other building products, primarily in Mississippi and
Alabama. The combined purchase price of these two separate acquisitions was approximately
$104 million and was funded through our U.S. revolving line of credit. Pacific
had net sales of $53 million (unaudited) for the year ended December 31,
2005 and MRS and ARS together generated net sales of $76 million (unaudited)
for the year ended December 31, 2005. The Company will include the results
of operations of Pacific, MRS and ARS in its financial results from the date of
the acquisitions and apply purchase accounting as of the dates of the acquisitions.  

In January 2006, the
Company and its lenders agreed to increase the revolving lines of credit by an
additional $50 million and amend the term loans to provide for additional loans
totaling $10 million that were added to our current term loans. The lenders
also agreed to waive certain minimum availability levels related to the January 2006
acquisitions. None of the other terms of the revolving lines of credit and term
loans were changed.

ITEM 2.   

MANAGEMENT S
  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

You should read the
following discussion in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis
included in our 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless otherwise
specifically indicated, all references to  2006  refer to the three months
(first quarter) ended December 31, 2005 of our fiscal year ending September 30,
2006 and all references to  2005  refer to the three months (first quarter)
ended December 31, 2004 of our fiscal year ended September 24, 2005.  

Overview   

We are one of the largest
distributors of residential and non-residential roofing materials in the United
States and Canada. We are also a distributor of other complementary building
products, including siding, windows, specialty lumber products and
waterproofing systems for residential and non-residential building exteriors.
We purchase products from a large number of manufacturers and then distribute
these goods to a customer base consisting of contractors and, to a lesser
extent, general contractors, retailers and building material suppliers.  

As of December 31,
2005, we distributed up to 8,500 SKUs through 138 branches in the
United States and Canada.  We had approximately 2,160 employees at that
time, including our sales and marketing team of approximately 540 employees. In
fiscal year 2005, approximately 90% of our net sales were in the United States.
We stock one of the most extensive assortments of high-quality branded products
in the industry, enabling us to deliver products to our customers on a timely
basis.  

Execution of the
operating plan at each of our branches drives our financial results. Revenues
are impacted by the relative strength of the residential and non-residential
roofing markets we serve. We allow each of our branches to develop its own
marketing plan and mix of products based upon its local market. We
differentiate ourselves from the competition by providing customer services,
including job site delivery, tapered insulation layouts and design and metal
fabrication, and by providing credit. We consider customer relations and our
employees  knowledge of roofing and exterior building materials to be very
important to our ability to increase customer loyalty and maintain customer
satisfaction. We invest significant resources in training our employees in
sales techniques, management skills and product knowledge. While we consider
these attributes important drivers of our business, we continually pay close attention
to controlling operating costs.  

Our growth strategy
includes both internal growth (opening branches, growing sales with existing
customers and introducing new products) and acquisition growth.  Our main
acquisition strategy is to target market leaders in geographic areas that we
presently do not service. Our October 2005 acquisition of SDI Holding, Inc.
( Shelter ) reflects this approach. Shelter is a leading distributor of roofing
and other building materials, currently with 53 branches in the Southeast, Midwest
and Central Plains regions of the United States, growing areas targeted by us
for expansion.  In addition, we also acquire smaller companies to
supplement branch openings within existing markets. Our November 2005 acquisition
of Easton Wholesale Company, Inc. ( EWI ), which was integrated into our
region in the Mid-Atlantic, is an example of such an acquisition.  

Results of Operations   

The following table
shows, for the periods indicated, information derived from our consolidated
statements of operations, expressed as a percentage of net sales for the
periods presented.  

12  

In managing our business,
we consider all growth, including branch expansion, to be internal growth
unless it results from an acquisition. When we refer to growth in existing
markets in our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations, we include growth from existing and newly-opened branches but
exclude growth from acquired branches until they have been under our ownership
for at least one full fiscal year. At December 31, 2005, 72 branches were
included in our existing market calculations and 66 branches were excluded because
they were acquired during or after fiscal year 2005. Acquired markets (Note 5) for
2006 include Shelter, EWI, JGA, ISI and CSI, while acquired markets for 2005
represent only a partial month s operations for JGA.

Net
Sales   

Consolidated net sales
increased $140.7 million, or 70.6%, to $339.9 million in 2006 from $199.2
million in 2005. Existing markets saw internal growth of $27.9 million or
14.3%, while acquired markets contributed the remaining increase of $112.8
million. We did not open any new branches in existing markets during 2006 or
2005, but we did open two new branches in acquired markets in 2006.  For
2006, our acquired markets had combined product group sales of $70.7, $16.2 and
$29.8 million in residential roofing products, non-residential roofing products
and complementary building products, respectively, while the product group
sales for our existing markets were as follows:

Three Months Ended   

Note:
Total 2006 existing market sales of $223.2 million plus 2006 sales from
acquired markets of $116.7 million equal $339.9 million of total 2006 sales.
Total 2005 existing market sales of $195.3 million plus 2005 sales from JGA of
$3.9 million equal the total 2005 sales of $199.2 million.  We believe the existing market information is
useful to investors because it helps explain organic growth.  

Our first-quarter existing
market growth was due primarily to the following factors:  

overall
estimated price increases of approximately 6%-8% compared to 2005; 

                    strong
residential roofing demand, especially in the southeast and Gulf areas; 

                    five
new branches opened in existing markets since December 31, 2004; 

                    strong
non-residential roofing demand, although not at the level experienced in the
prior year; and 

                    continued
high home remodeling demand.

Gross
Profit   

For the
Three Months Ended   

Our existing markets 
gross profit grew 15.5% and contributed $7.7 million to the total gross profit
increase, while acquired markets accounted for the remaining $25.7 million increase. 
Existing markets  gross margin was 25.8% in 2006 compared to 25.5% in 2005, as
we saw a slight increase in vendor incentive rebates and improved pricing in
certain regions.  Due to their product
mix, JGA and ISI have lower gross margins than our existing markets and this
has lowered our overall consolidated gross margin. We expect our future
quarterly gross margins to fluctuate from 24% to 26% depending primarily on our
product mix.  

Operating
Expenses   

For the
Three Months Ended   

Our existing markets 
operating expenses increased $3.8 million, or 11.6%, to $36.1 million
in 2006 from $32.4 million in 2005, while acquired markets accounted for
the remaining $21.2 million increase. The existing markets  operating expense
increase was due primarily to increased payroll and related costs of $1.8 million
and a higher provision for bad debts of $0.8 million. Most of the increase in
payroll costs was driven by our increased sales volume and five new branches
opened in existing markets since December 31, 2004. Existing markets 
transportation costs increased $0.5 million in 2006 compared to 2005, as a
result of the higher sales volume and higher fuel costs. Selling expenses in
our existing markets, excluding depreciation and payroll costs, increased by
$0.8 million due to the additional branches and increased sales volume. 
Depreciation expense increased by $0.4 million from 2005 to 2006.  

As a percentage of net
sales, overall operating expenses increased to 17.1% in 2006 from 16.6% in 2005,
primarily due to Shelter s higher operating expenses as a percentage of
sales. Existing markets  operating expenses as a percentage of net sales
dropped to 16.2% from 16.6%, primarily due to the leveraging of our fixed costs
over the higher sales volume.  

Interest
Expense   

Interest expense increased
$3.1 million to $4.0 million in 2006 from $0.9 million in 2005. We
amended our revolving lines of credit and term loans in connection with the
Shelter acquisition and increased our borrowings accordingly. Interest rates
also increased from the prior year.  

14  

Loss on
Early Retirement of Debt   

On
September 28, 2004, we used a portion of the proceeds from our IPO to pay
off the remaining junior subordinated notes. 
In connection with the associated early retirement of debt, we recorded
a $0.9 million loss in 2005.  

Income
Taxes   

Income tax expense was
$8.8 million in 2006 compared to $6.8 million in 2005. We have estimated our
fiscal 2006 effective income tax rate to be 40.5%, while our effective income
tax rate was 43.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2005.   The
decrease is due to the strong earnings from our Canadian subsidiary, which has
enabled us to use a more favorable tax credit for foreign taxes. In addition,
due to the strong earnings throughout our domestic regions and having no
unusable losses in any state, we experienced a drop in our overall effective
state income tax rate.  

Seasonality
and quarterly fluctuations   

In general, sales and net
income are highest during our first, third and fourth fiscal quarters, which
represent the peak months of construction, especially in our branches in the
northeastern U.S. and in Canada. Our sales are substantially lower during the
second quarter, when we historically have incurred low net income levels or net
losses. These quarterly fluctuations have diminished as we have diversified
into the southern regions of the United States.  

We generally experience
an increase of inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable during the
first, third and fourth quarters of the year as a result of the seasonality of
our business. Our peak borrowing level generally occurs during the third
quarter, primarily because dated accounts payable offered by our suppliers
typically are payable in April, May and June, while our peak accounts
receivable collections typically occur from June through November.  

We generally experience a
slowing of collections of our accounts receivable during our second quarter,
mainly due to the inability of some of our customers to conduct their
businesses effectively in inclement weather in certain of our regions. We
continue to attempt to collect those receivables, which require payment under
our standard terms. We do not provide any concessions to our customers during
this quarter of the year, although we may take advantage of seasonal
concessions and incentives from our vendors. Also during the second quarter, we
generally experience our lowest availability under our senior secured credit
facilities, which are asset-based lending facilities.  

Certain
quarterly financial data   

The following table sets
forth certain unaudited quarterly data for the fiscal years 2006 and 2005
which, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments (consisting of
normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of
this data. Results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative
of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends.  

Liquidity
and capital resources   

We had cash of $7.3 million
at December 31, 2005, compared to cash of $4.9 million at December 31,
2004 and a cash overdraft of $3.6 million at September 24, 2005. Our
working capital was $172.7 million at December 31, 2005 compared to
working capital of $37.8 million at December 31, 2004 and $121.0
million at September 24, 2005.  

2006 compared to 2005    

Our net cash provided by
operating activities was $22.9 million for 2006 compared to $12.8 million
for 2005. Our sales growth drove our income from operations to $25.7 million
in 2006 from $17.3 million in 2005. Inventory levels, exclusive of the effects
of businesses acquired, increased by $15.6 million, mostly due to eight new
branches opened (including three opened in acquired markets) since December 31,
2004 and anticipation of a continued strong sales growth rate. Inventory turns
stayed relatively constant in 2006 compared to 2005. The cash impact from the
growth in inventory was more than offset by a seasonal decrease in accounts
receivable, exclusive of the effects of businesses acquired. The number of days
outstanding for accounts receivable, based upon sales for the first quarter,
declined slightly in 2006.  

15  

Net cash used in
investing activities in 2006 was $173.3 million compared to $31.3 million
in 2005 due primarily to the acquisition of Shelter for an aggregate net
purchase price of $166.9 million. Net capital expenditures declined in 2006 due
to the use of new capital lease financings of $3.3 million for new
transportation and warehouse equipment to service our growth.  

Net cash provided by
financing activities was $161.2 million in 2006 compared to $27.1 million
in 2005. The net cash provided by financing activities in 2006 reflects
borrowings under our revolving lines of credit and term loans, primarily for
the Shelter acquisition, and net proceeds of $51.6 million from the public sale
of two million shares of common stock in December 2005 (Note 1). The net
cash provided by financing activities in 2005 primarily reflected the proceeds
from our IPO less the associated warrant redemption and debt payments.  

Capital
Resources   

Our principal source of
liquidity at December 31, 2005, was our available borrowings of $97.7 million
under revolving lines of credit. Our borrowing base availability is determined
primarily by trade accounts receivable and product inventory levels. Borrowings
outstanding under the revolving lines of credit in the accompanying balance
sheets at December 31, 2005 and September 24, 2005 were classified as
long-term liabilities and at December 31, 2004 as current liabilities in
accordance with EITF Issue 95-22,   Balance
Sheet Classification of Borrowings Outstanding under Revolving Credit
Arrangements that include both a Subjective Acceleration Clause and a Lock-Box
Arrangement  .  

Liquidity is defined as
the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet the current need for
cash. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund
our operating activities, taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our
business. Significant factors which could affect liquidity include the
following:  

the adequacy of available bank lines
of credit; 

the ability to attract long-term
capital with satisfactory terms; 

cash flows generated from operating
activities; 

acquisitions; and 

capital expenditures. 

Our primary capital needs
are for working capital obligations and other general corporate purposes,
including acquisitions and capital expenditures. Our primary sources of working
capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings. In the past,
we have financed acquisitions initially through increased bank borrowings, the
issuance of common stock and other borrowings, then repaying any such
borrowings with cash flows from operations. We have funded our capital
expenditures through increased bank borrowings or through capital leases and
then have reduced these obligations with cash flows from operations.  

We believe we have
adequate availability of capital to fund our present operations, meet our
commitments on our existing debt, and fund anticipated growth, including
expansion in existing and targeted market areas. We continually seek potential
acquisitions and from time to time hold discussions with acquisition
candidates. If suitable acquisition opportunities or working capital needs
arise that would require additional financing, we believe that our financial
position and earnings history provide a strong base for obtaining additional
financing resources at competitive rates and terms. Additionally, we may issue
additional shares of common or preferred stock to raise funds, which we did in December 2005.
We made two acquisitions in January 2006 for a combined price of approximately
$104 million. In connection with these acquisitions, we requested an increase
of $50 million in our revolving lines of credit and an additional $10 million
of term loans. These requests were approved by our lenders in January 2006.  

Indebtedness   

We currently have the
following credit facilities:  

a senior secured credit facility in
the U.S.; 

a Canadian senior secured credit
facility; and 

a capital lease facility. 

16  

Senior secured credit facilities    

The credit facilities, as
amended and restated on October 14, 2005, mature on October 14, 2010
and consist of a $230 million United States revolving line of credit and a CDN
$15 million Canadian revolving line of credit, commonly referred to as
revolvers, and term loans totaling $80.0 million outstanding at December 31,
2005. The facilities include an option of increasing the revolving lines of
credit by an additional $50 million, which we requested and which was approved
in January 2006 along with additional term loans totaling $10 million. The
lenders also waived certain minimum availability levels related to our
acquisitions in January 2006. None of the other terms of the revolving
lines of credit and term loans were changed.  

The facilities provide
for a cash receipts lockbox arrangement that gives us sole control over the
funds in our lockbox accounts, unless excess availability is less than $10
million or an event of default occurs, in which case the senior secured lenders
have the right to take control over such funds and to apply such funds to
repayment of the senior debt. The lockbox arrangement is operational and the
revolver borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2005 and September 24,
2005 have been classified as long-term-debt for amounts expected to be
outstanding for greater than one year.  

As of December 31,
2005, there was $119.0 million outstanding and $97.7 million available for
borrowing under the revolvers, subject to changes in our borrowing base
availability determined primarily by trade accounts receivable and product
inventories levels. We also had $4.0 million of outstanding standby letters of
credit.  

Interest on borrowings
under the U.S. facilities is payable at our election at either of the following
rates:.  

an index rate (that is the higher of (a) the
base rate for corporate loans quoted in   The
Wall Street Journal   or (b) the Federal Reserve overnight rate
plus 1/2 of 1%) plus a margin of 0.25% to 1.50%, or 

the current LIBOR Rate plus a margin
ranging from 1.50% to 2.75%. 

Interest under the
Canadian facility is payable at our election at either of the following rates:  

an index rate (that is the higher of (1) the
Canadian prime rate as quoted in the   Globe
and Mail   and (2) the 30-day BA Rate plus 1.25%) plus 0.50%, or 

the BA rate as described in the
Canadian facility plus 1.75%. 

Substantially all of our
assets, including the capital stock and assets of our wholly-owned
subsidiaries, secure our obligations under these senior secured credit
facilities. The senior secured credit facilities have numerous restrictive
covenants, including a required fixed charge coverage of 1.20 to 1, a senior
indebtedness to EBITDA ratio of 3.50 to 1 and a total indebtedness to EBITDA
ratio of 4.75 to 1, in each case determined on a trailing twelve-month basis at
the end of each quarter. In addition, in any fiscal year capital expenditures
may not exceed 1.5% of gross revenues and annual rental payments under
operating leases may not exceed $22.0 million. There are also certain minimum
availability levels that must be maintained. As of December 31, 2005, we
were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements.  

Capital lease facilities    

Our capital lease
facilities allow us to finance a portion of our transportation and warehouse
equipment. The facilities provide us with $11 million of availability, of
which $5.3 million was outstanding at December 31, 2005, with fixed
interest rates ranging from 4.7% to 6.7%.  

Cautionary
Statement for Purposes of the  Safe Harbor  Provisions of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995   

Our disclosure and
analysis in this report contains forward-looking information that involves
risks and uncertainties. Our forward-looking statements express our current
expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events, including
projections of future performance, statements of management s plans and
objectives, future contracts, and forecasts of trends and other matters. You
can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to
historic or current facts and often use words such as  anticipate ,  estimate ,
 expect ,  believe,   will likely result,   outlook,   project  and other words
and expressions of similar meaning. No assurance can be given that the results
in any forward-looking statements will be achieved and actual results could be
affected by one or more factors, which could cause them to differ materially.
For these statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for
forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act.  

Certain factors that may
affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from
those expressed in any forward-looking statements include those set forth under
the heading  Risk Factors  in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24,
2005.

Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   

Interest Rate Risk   

There have been no
material changes other than the financial derivatives disclosed below from what
we reported in our Form 10-K for the year ended September 24, 2005.  

Financial
Derivatives   

We enter into interest
rate derivative agreements, commonly referred to as swaps or collars, with the
objective of reducing volatility in our borrowing costs. At December 31,
2005, we had one interest rate collar effectively converting the variable LIBOR
component on a portion of our senior credit facility term debt to a fixed rate.
That collar has a notional amount of $75 million, expires in November 2008,
and has a floor rate of 4.33% and a cap rate of 5.85%. The fair market value of
the agreement resulted in a liability of approximately $0.2 million at December 31,
2005, which was determined based on current interest rates and expected trends.
Since these instruments do not qualify as hedges, changes in the unrealized
gain or loss are recorded in interest expense. The differentials to be paid or
received under the terms of the agreement are accrued as interest rates change
and are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense related to the debt. In
January 2006, we entered into another interest rate collar with a notional
amount of $75 million that expires in January 2008 and has a floor rate of
4.54% and cap rate of 5.09%  

Foreign Exchange Risk   

There have been no
material changes from what we reported in our Form 10-K for the year ended
September 24, 2005.  

Item 4.
Controls and Procedures   

The term  disclosure
controls and procedures  is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Act). The rules refer to the
controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified. As of December 31,
2005, management, including the CEO and CFO, performed an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures. Based on that evaluation, management, including the CEO and CFO,
concluded that as of December 31, 2005, our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective at ensuring that material information related to us
or our consolidated subsidiaries is made known to them and is disclosed on a
timely basis in our reports filed under the Act.  

We maintain a system of
internal control over financial reporting that is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Based on the
most recent evaluation, we have concluded that no significant changes in our
internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last fiscal
quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 MATERIAL CONTRACTS

EXHIBIT 10.1   

FIRST
AMENDMENT TO   

    THIRD
AMENDED AND RESTATED LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT    

This   FIRST AMENDMENT TO THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED LOAN AND
SECURITY AGREEMENT   (this  Agreement ) is dated as of December 23,
2005, and is entered into by and among   BEACON
SALES ACQUISITION, INC.   ( Borrower ) and the Domestic Subsidiary
Guarantors which are signatories hereto (together with Borrower,  Obligors    GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION   ( GE Capital ), for itself as a
Lender, as L/C Issuer and as Agent; and the Lenders which are signatories
hereto.  

WHEREAS  ,
Agent, Lenders and Obligors are parties to a certain Third Amended and Restated
Loan and Security Agreement dated as of October 14, 2005 (as such
agreement has been or may hereafter be from time to time amended, supplemented
or otherwise modified, the  Loan Agreement  and 

WHEREAS  ,
Borrower has requested that GE Capital, as a Lender, enter into letters of
credit or other credit enhancement to support the payment obligations of
Borrower under any interest rate protection or hedging agreement as described
herein; and 

WHEREAS  ,
the parties desire to amend the Loan Agreement to provide for such letters of
credit or other credit enhancement as hereinafter set forth. 

NOW
THEREFORE  , in consideration of the mutual conditions and
agreements set forth in the Loan Agreement and this Agreement, and other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 

1.                                               Definitions    . 
Capitalized terms used in this Agreement, unless otherwise defined
herein, shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Loan Agreement.  

2.                                               Amendments to Loan
Agreement    .  

2.1                                    Section 2.1
of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended by inserting the following as (J)
thereof: 

(J)                                 Swap
Related Reimbursement Obligations . 

(1)                                     Borrower
agrees to reimburse GE Capital in immediately available funds in the amount of
any payment made by GE Capital under a Swap Related L/C (such reimbursement
obligation, whether contingent upon payment by GE Capital under the Swap
Related L/C or otherwise, being herein called a   Swap Related Reimbursement
Obligation  ).  No Swap Related
Reimbursement Obligation for any Swap Related L/C may exceed the amount of the
payment 

obligations
owed by Borrower under the interest rate protection or hedging agreement or
transaction supported by the Swap Related L/C.  

(2)                                     A
Swap Related Reimbursement Obligation shall be due and payable by Borrower
within one (1) Business Day after the date on which the related payment is
made by GE Capital under the Swap Related L/C. 

(3)                                     Any
Swap Related Reimbursement Obligation shall, during the period in which it is
unpaid, bear interest at the rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus one percent
(1%), as if the unpaid amount of the Swap Related Reimbursement Obligation were
a LIBOR Loan, and not at any otherwise applicable Default Rate.  Such interest shall be payable upon
demand.  The following additional
provisions apply to the calculation and charging of interest by reference to
LIBOR: 

(a)                                     LIBOR
shall be determined for each successive one-month LIBOR Period during which the
Swap Related Reimbursement Obligation is unpaid, notwithstanding the occurrence
of any Event of Default and even if the LIBOR Period were to extend beyond the
Termination Date. 

(b)                                    If
a Swap Related Reimbursement Obligation is paid during a monthly period for
which LIBOR is determined, interest shall be pro-rated and charged for the
portion of the monthly period during which the Swap Related Reimbursement
Obligation was unpaid.   Section 2.9(B)  and
any other provision relating to the indemnification by Borrower of losses,
costs and expenses relating to LIBOR Loans shall not apply to any payment of a
Swap Related Reimbursement Obligation during the monthly period. 

(c)                                     Notwithstanding
the last paragraph of the definition of  LIBOR , if LIBOR is no longer
available from Telerate News Service, LIBOR shall be determined by GE Capital
from such financial reporting service or other information available to GE
Capital as in GE Capital s reasonable discretion indicates GE Capital s cost of

notwithstanding the occurrence of any Event of Default and even if the BA
Period were to extend beyond the Termination Date. 

(b)                                    If

charges or expenses and such beneficiary may factor such fees, charges, or
expenses into the pricing of any interest rate protection or hedging agreement
or transaction supported by the Swap Related L/C.

obligation under this Increased Commitment Agreement is or is held to be
invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality,

Increased Commitment Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents, or
supplements may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different
parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which, when so executed and
delivered, will be deemed an original and all of which shall together
constitute one and the same instrument.

as expressly set forth herein, the terms and provisions set forth in this
Agreement shall not be deemed to be a modification or waiver of any term or
condition of the Loan Agreement.  The
terms and provisions of the Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents are ratified and confirmed and shall
continue in full force and effect and shall continue to guarantee or secure, as
the case may be, to the fullest extent possible, the payment and performance of
all Obligations under or in respect of the Loan Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents and all Collateral
