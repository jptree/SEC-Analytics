Basis
                  of Presentation  

The
        accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Luby's, Inc.
        (the
        "Company" or "Luby's") have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally
        Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") for interim financial information
        and
        with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation
        S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information
        and
        footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements as they are
        prepared for the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.  In
        the opinion
        of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals)
        considered necessary for a fair presentation have been
        included.  Operating results for the periods ended February
        15, 2006,
        are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the
        fiscal year ending August 30, 2006. 

The
        balance sheet dated August 31, 2005, included in this Form 10-Q, has been
        derived from the audited financial statements at that date.  However,
        this Form 10-Q does not include all of the information and footnotes required
        by
        GAAP for an annual filing of complete financial
        statements.  Therefore, these financial statements should be
        read in
        conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes included
        in
        Luby's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31,
        2005. 

Certain
        accounts and prior period results have been reclassified to provide more
        meaningful comparability to the Company's current presentation. Prior
        period results have been reclassified to show the retroactive effect of
        discontinued operations per the Company's business plan.  
        As stores
        are closed in the future and presented in discontinued operations, quarterly
        and
        annual financial amounts, where applicable, will be reclassified for further
        comparability. 

Note
                  2.  

Accounting
                  Periods  

The
        Company's fiscal year ends on the last Wednesday in August. As such, each
        fiscal
        year normally consists of 13 four-week periods, accounting for 364 days.
        Each of
        the first three quarters of each fiscal year consists of three four-week
        periods, while the fourth quarter normally consists of four four-week periods.
        Comparability between accounting periods may be affected by varying lengths
        of
        the periods, as well as the seasonality associated with the restaurant
        business. 

Note
                  3.  

Reclassification  

Store
        management compensation reported for fiscal year 2005 has been reclassified
        from
 Other Operating Expenses  to  Payroll and Related Costs  to provide
        comparability to financial results reported by the Company s peers in the
        industry. Prior period results reported have been reclassified to conform
        to the
        current period presentation. 

Below
        is
        a summarization of the reclassified expenses    (in
        thousands)   :

Income
                  Taxes 

The
        following is a summary of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of
        the
        current quarter and prior fiscal year-end: 

The
        following table details the categories of deferred income tax assets and
        liabilities resulting from the cumulative tax effects of temporary differences
        as of the end of each period presented:

Relative
        only to continuing operations, the reconciliation of the expense (benefit)
        for
        income taxes to the expected income tax expense (benefit), computed using
        the
        statutory tax rate, was as follows:  

For
        the
        two quarters ended February 15, 2006, including both continuing and discontinued
        operations,  
        the
        Company generated gross taxable income of approximately $2.9 million, which
        will
        be offset by net operating loss carryforwards from prior years. However,
        the
        Company will incur an Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT ) liability of approximately
        $64,000. The AMT liability may be used as a credit in the future if regular
        income tax exceeds future AMT. Actual cash payments of estimated income taxes
        of
        approximately $137,000 were made during the two quarters ended February 15,
        2006.   For
        the
        2005 fiscal year, including both continuing and discontinued
        operations,  
        the
        Company generated gross taxable income of approximately $6.2 million which
        will
        be offset by net operating loss carryforwards from prior years. However,
        the
        Company incurred an AMT liability of approximately $117,000 for the 2005
        fiscal
        year.  

For
        fiscal years 2004 and 2003, including both continuing and discontinued
        operations, the Company generated net operating loss carryforwards of
        approximately $4.0 million and $31.7 million, respectively, which will fully
        expire in 2024 and 2023, respectively, if not utilized. Due to the Company s
        cumulative loss carryforward position, no federal income taxes were paid
        in
        fiscal 2004 or fiscal 2003. The tax benefit of the operating losses for book
        purposes in fiscal years 2004 and 2003 was netted against a valuation allowance
        because loss carrybacks were exhausted with the fiscal 2002 tax filing and
        the
        future realization of loss carryforwards was uncertain. For book purposes
        in
        fiscal years after 2004, tax expense and benefits will be offset against
        the
        valuation allowance until such time as the future realization of loss
        carryforwards becomes reasonably certain. 

The
        balance of the net operating loss carryovers at the end of fiscal year 2005
        was
        approximately $29.2 million. At the end of the second quarter fiscal 2006,
        which
        ended February 15, 2006, remaining net operating loss carryovers were
        approximately $26.3 million. 

The
        Company's federal income tax returns have been periodically reviewed by the
        Internal Revenue Service. The Company's 2003, 2002, 2001, and 2000 returns
        are
        currently under review. Management believes that adequate provisions for
        income
        taxes have been reflected in the financial statements and is not aware of
        any
        significant exposure items that have not been reflected in the financial
        statements. The IRS review could result in a reduction of the cumulative
        net
        operating losses that are currently being carried forward to offset future
        taxable income.

Property
                  and
                  Equipment 

The
        cost
        and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment at February 15, 2006,
        and
        August 31, 2005, together with the related estimated useful lives used in
        computing depreciation and amortization, were as follows: 

On
        August
        31, 2005, Luby s, Inc. entered into an amended and restated $45.0 million
        unsecured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the  Revolving Credit Facility )
        among Luby s, Inc. and a syndicate of three independent banks. The Revolving
        Credit Facility may, subject to certain terms and conditions, be increased
        by an
        additional $15.0 million for a total facility size of $60.0 million. The
        Revolving Credit Facility allows up to $10.0 million of the available credit
        to
        be extended in the form of letters of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility
        terminates on, and all amounts owing thereunder must be repaid on, August
        31,
        2008. 

At
        any
        time throughout the term of the loan, the Company has the option to elect
        one of
        two bases of interest rates. One interest rate option is the greater of (a)
        the
        federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, or (b) prime, plus, in either case,
        an
        applicable spread that ranges from 0% to 0.25% per annum. The other interest
        rate option is LIBOR (London InterBank Offered Rate) plus an applicable spread
        that ranges from 1.00% to 1.75% per annum. The applicable spread under each
        option is dependent upon certain measures of the Company s financial performance
        at the time of election. 

The
        Company also pays a quarterly commitment fee based on the unused portion
        of the
        Revolving Credit Facility, which is also dependent upon the Company s financial
        performance, ranging from 0.25% to 0.35% per annum. The Company also is
        obligated to pay certain fees in respect of any letters of credit issued
        as well
        as an administrative fee to the lender acting as administrative agent. Finally,
        the Company was obligated to pay to the lenders a one-time fee in connection
        with the closing of the Revolving Credit Facility. 

The
        Revolving Credit Facility contains customary events of default and covenants
        and
        restrictions on the Company s ability to engage in certain activities, including
        financial performance measures and limitations on capital expenditures, asset
        sales and acquisitions. At February 15, 2006, the Company was in full compliance
        with all covenants. 

All
        amounts owed by Luby s, Inc. under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed
        by its subsidiaries. 

The
        Company s total outstanding debt of $7.2 million as of February 15, 2006, is due
        and payable on August 31, 2008, under the terms of the Revolving Credit
        Facility. 

10 

Additionally,
        at February 15, 2006, the Company had a total of approximately $5.8 million
        committed under letters of credit which have been issued as security for
        the
        payment of insurance obligations classified as accrued expenses on the balance
        sheet. Of these letters of credit, approximately $5.1 were issued under the
        Revolving Credit Facility. An additional $700,000 in letters of credit, issued
        under a separate arrangement with one of the banks in the Revolving Credit
        Facility group, are collateralized by held-to-maturity time deposits. As
        of
        March 2, 2006, the total amount committed under letters of credit was reduced
        to
        $5.1 million.  

Interest
        Expense   

        Interest
        expense incurred year to date as of February 15, 2006 and February 9, 2005,
        was
        $  643,000
          and
        $  2.9
          million,
        respectively. Approximated $  416,000
          and
        $  2.4
          million
        in interest payment were made for the same periods, respectively.

Impairment
                  of Long-Lived Assets and Store Closings/Discontinued
                  Operations  

Impairment
        of Long-Lived Assets and Store Closings   

        In
        accordance with Company guidelines, management periodically reviews the
        financial performance of each store for indicators of impairment or indicators
        that closure would be appropriate. Where indicators are present, such as
        three
        full fiscal years of negative cash flows or other unfavorable market conditions,
        the carrying values of assets are written down to the estimated future
        discounted cash flows or fully written off in the case of negative cash flows
        anticipated in the future. Estimated future cash flows are based upon regression
        analyses generated from similar Company restaurants, discounted at the Company's
        weighted-average cost of capital. 

Estimated
        lease settlements under the Company s 2001 disposal plan were originally charged
        to expense under  Provision for (Reversal of) Asset Impairments and Restaurant
        Closings.  Subsequent adjustments to these lease settlements for actual exit
        costs incurred are also reflected in the  Provision for (Reversal of) Asset
        Impairments and Restaurant Closings.  

The
        activity reflected in the  Provision for (Reversal of) Asset Impairments and
        Restaurant Closings  during the first two quarters of fiscal 2006 is primarily
        related to a gain on the sale of one property and the move of two former
        restaurant units from properties held for sale. The reclassified properties
        are
        to be used by operations and facilities services. The amount recorded in
        the
        first two quarters of 2006 is for the reversal of prior impairments of estimated
        selling costs of these units. 

Discontinued
        Operations   

        From
        the
        third quarter of fiscal year 2003 through February 15, 2006, the Company
        has
        closed 64 operating stores. The operating results of these locations have
        been
        reclassified and reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented
        as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144,
         Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.  The following
        are the sales and pretax losses reported for all discontinued
        locations: 

The
        Company has continued to apply the proceeds from the sale of closed restaurants
        to pay down its debt. Of the total debt paid down during the first two quarters
        of fiscal years 2006 and 2005, $3.7 million and $10.0 million, respectively,
        resulted from sales proceeds related to business plan assets. Proceeds from
        the
        sale of properties held for sale as of February 15, 2006, may also be applied
        to
        pay down debt, but under the terms of the Company s Revolving Credit Facility,
        there is no requirement to do so. 

11 

In
        accordance with EITF 87-24,  Allocation of Interest to Discontinued Operations, 
        interest on debt that is required to be repaid as a result of a disposal
        transaction should be allocated to discontinued operations. For the second
        quarters of fiscal years 2006 and 2005 approximately $50,000, and $543,000,
        respectively, in interest expense were allocated to discontinued operations,
        while approximately $122,000, and $1.2 million, respectively, were allocated
        to
        discontinued operations in the first two quarters of 2006 and 2005. The basis
        of
        the allocation to discontinued operations was an application of the credit
        facility's historical effective interest rates to the portion of the estimated
        total debt that equals the amount related to current and future business
        plan
        disposals as explained in the previous paragraph. 

Relative
        to the business plan, as the Company has formally settled lease terminations
        or
        has reached definitive agreements to terminate leases, the related charges
        have
        been recorded. As of February 15, 2006 and August 31, 2005, no lease exit
        costs
        associated with the business plan met these criteria and, consequently, were
        not
        accrued as of those dates. However, for the quarter ended February 15, 2006,
        the
        Company recognized $200,000 for termination costs paid under definitive lease
        settlement agreements. Furthermore, the Company has not accrued future rental
        costs in instances where locations closed; however, management has the ability
        to sublease at amounts equal to or greater than the rental costs. The Company
        does not accrue employee settlement costs; these charges are expensed as
        incurred. 

The
        following summarizes discontinued operations for the periods
        presented: 

The
        impairments are related to write downs taken on properties closed and designated
        for immediate disposal. The assets of these individual closed units have
        been
        written down to their net realizable values. Impairments in value are determined
        based on comparisons made to similar property values in their respective
        markets
        and historical sale results. As the assets are recorded at their estimated
        net
        realizable value, there can be no assurance that the carrying value will
        equal
        the actual net proceeds upon sale. The Company offsets any gains or losses
        from
        applicable property disposals against impairments to arrive at net impairments.
        Dispositions of properties held for sale are expected to be completed within
        one
        year. 

Other
        items include allocated interest, lease settlements, employment termination
        and
        shut-down costs, as well as operating losses through each restaurant's closing
        date and carrying costs incurred until the final disposal of these
        locations. 

There
        are
        no active restaurant operations included in discontinued operations. Continuing
        cash flows used by discontinued operations consist primarily of costs related
        to
        the ownership and maintenance of properties that are being held for sale,
        and
        rental costs associated with leases that have not yet terminated. These
        activities are expected to cease within the next year as Company-owned
        properties are sold and leases are settled. 

12 

Property
        Held for Sale    

        At
        February 15, 2006, the Company had a total of six properties recorded at
        approximately $4.2 million in property held for sale. Of the six properties
        remaining, one is related to prior disposal plans. In the first quarter of
        fiscal year 2006, two properties were reclassified from property held for
        sale
        to property and equipment. These properties are to be used to support
        operations. Five properties were sold during fiscal year 2006. On August
        31,
        2005, the Company had a total of thirteen properties recorded at $9.3 million
        in
        property held for sale. 

The
        Company is actively marketing the locations currently classified as property
        held for sale. When sold, proceeds from properties that have been identified
        as
        held for sale, are expected to be used to reduce outstanding debt. Property
        held
        for sale consists primarily of already-closed restaurant properties.
  Property
        held for sale is valued at the lower of net depreciable value or net realizable
        value. 

The
        Company s results of discontinued operations will be affected to the extent
        proceeds from the sales exceed or are less than net book value.

Off-Balance-Sheet
        Arrangements   

        The

Pending
        Claims   

        Three
        wage and hour investigations by the U.S. Department of Labor related to the
        application of wait staff tip pool sums have recently been consolidated in
        the
        Houston district. During the second quarter of 2006, the Company accrued
        an
        estimate for the anticipated settlement costs associated with these claims
        in
        payroll and related costs. However, final resolution of these claims may
        be
        different from the amount accrued. 

The
        Company presently, and from time to time, is subject to pending claims and
        lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of
        management, the resolution of any pending legal proceedings will not have
        a
        material adverse effect on the Company's operations or financial
        position. 

Surety
        Bonds   

        By
        February 15, 2006, the Company replaced the $5 million in surety bonds with
        letters of credit under the Company s Revolving Credit Facility (as described in
        Note 6). This replacement allowed for a reduction in the required amount
        of
        security to cover the insurance obligations and provide the Company with
        a more
        cost effective collateral option as security for the insurance
        obligations.

        Pappas Partners, L.P. and Pappas Restaurants, Inc.  
        (the
        "Pappas Entities"), that may provide services to the Company under the terms
        of
        the Master Sales Agreement.  

Under
        the
        terms of the Master Sales Agreement, the Pappas Entities may provide specialized
        (customized) equipment fabrication and basic equipment maintenance, including
        stainless steel stoves, shelving, rolling carts and chef tables, to the Company.
        The pricing of equipment, repair, and maintenance is set and evaluated
        periodically and is considered by management to be primarily at or below
        market
        for comparable goods and services. To assist in monitoring pricing of the
        transactions associated with the Master Sales Agreement, the Finance and
        Audit
        Committee of the Company s Board of Directors has periodically in the past used
        independent valuation consultants. The Company paid $2,000 in the first two
        quarters of fiscal year 2006 and approximately $48,000 in the first two quarters
        of fiscal year 2005 under the terms of the Master Sales Agreement, which
        related
        to custom-fabricated and refurbished equipment. 

Prior
        to
        January 1, 2006, the Pappas Entities provided general business services to
        the
        Company under the terms of the Affiliate Services Agreement. Under the Affiliate
        Services Agreement, the Company incurred no costs during the first
        two
        quarters of 2006, and $11,000 in costs during the first two quarters of
        2005.

Operating
        Leases   

        The
        Company leases a facility, which is referred to as the Houston Service Center,
        from the Pappas Entities. The Houston Service Center serves as a centralized
        restaurant service center to support field operations. The facility is also
        used
        for repair and storage of new and used equipment.      The
        building at this location has 22,253 square feet of warehouse space and 5,664
        square feet of office space.   The
        lease
        is on a month-to-month basis and the   monthly
        rental rate is approximately $0.24 per square foot.   The
        Company paid approximately $34,000 and $41,000, repsectively, in each of
        the
        first two quarters of fiscal years 2006 and 2005 under the terms of that
        lease. 

The
        Company also leases a warehouse facility, which is referred to as the Storage
        Facility, from the Pappas Entities.   The
        Storage Facility is used to house the Company's equipment inventory.
  The
        Storage Facility complements the Houston Service Center with approximately
        27,000 square feet of warehouse space at an approximate monthly lease rate
        of
        $0.21 per square foot. The Company paid $28,000 and $35,000, respectively,
        for
        the first two quarters of each of the fiscal years 2006 and 2005 under the
        terms
        of this lease. 

The
        Company also leases space for one of its restaurants in   a
        retail
        strip center in Houston, Texas, that is owned by a limited partnership of
        which
        50% is owned by Christopher J. Pappas and Harris J. Pappas. The Company's
        restaurant has rented approximately 7% of the space in that center since
        July
        1969. The Company paid approximately $83,000 in each of the first two quarters
        of fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively, under the terms of this
        lease. 

Affiliated
        rents paid for the Houston Service Center, the Storage Facility and the Houston
        restaurant lease combined represented 9.9% and 8.8% of total rents for
        continuing operations during the first two quarters of each of the fiscal
        years
        2006 and 2005, respectively.  

The

Recently
                  Adopted Accounting
                  Pronouncements  

Share-Based
        Compensation   

        The
        Company has an Executive Stock Option Plan as well as Incentive Stock Plans
        for
        officers and employees ( Employee Stock Plans ) and a Non-employee Director
        Stock Option Plan for non-employee directors. These plans authorize the granting
        of stock options, restricted stock, and other types of awards consistent
        with
        the purpose of the plans (See Note 12 to the Company's Consolidated Financial
        Statements included in the 2005 Form 10-K). The number of shares authorized
        for
        issuance under the Company's plans as of February 15, 2006 totals 5,200,000,
        of
        which 2,113,461 shares were available for future issuance. Stock options
        granted
        under these plans are granted with an exercise price equal to the market
        price
        of the Company's stock at the date of grant except for the Executive Stock
        Option Plan. Option awards under the Executive Stock Option Plan vest 50%
        on the
        first anniversary of the grant date, 25% on the second anniversary of the
        grant
        date, and the remaining 25% on the third anniversary of the grant date and
        expire ten years from the grant date. Option awards under the Employee Stock
        Plans generally vest 25% each year on the anniversary of the grant date and
        expire six to ten years from the grant date. Option awards under the
        Non-employee Director Stock Option Plan generally vest 100% on the first
        anniversary of the grant date and expire ten years from the grant
        date. 

Prior
        to
        August 31, 2005, the Company accounted for its stock based compensation under
        the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board
        ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related
        interpretations, the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting
        for
        Stock-Based Compensation" and the disclosures required by SFAS No. 148,
        "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure." In
        accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, no stock-based compensation cost was
        reflected in the Company's prior year net income for grants of stock options
        to
        employees because the Company granted stock options with an exercise price
        equal
        to the market value of the stock on the date of grant. The reported stock
        based
        compensation expense, net of related tax effects, in the table below represents
        compensation costs associated with restricted stock grants.  

15 

Had
        the
        Company used the fair value based accounting method for stock compensation
        expense prescribed by SFAS Nos. 123 and 148 for the periods ended February
        9,
        2005, the Company's consolidated net income and net income per share would
        have
        been decreased to the pro-forma amounts illustrated as follows: 

(a)
           Income
        taxes have been offset by a valuation allowance. (See Note 4 of Notes to
        Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

Effective
        September 1, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions
        of
        SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective method. Under this method,
        compensation cost in the first two quarters of fiscal year 2006 includes
        the
        portion of awards vesting in the period for (a) all share-based payments
        granted
        prior to, but not vested as of August 31, 2005, based on the grant date fair
        value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No.123
        and
        (b) all share based payments granted subsequent to August 31, 2005, based
        on the
        grant date fair value estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
        Before adoption of SFAS No. 123R, pro forma disclosures reflected the fair
        value
        of each option grant estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
        option pricing model with the following weighted-average
        assumptions: 

Results
        of prior periods do not reflect any restated amounts, and the Company had
        no
        cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R under the modified
        prospective method. The Company's policy is to recognize compensation cost
        for
        awards with only service conditions and a graded vesting schedule on a straight
        line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Additionally,
        the Company's policy is to reserve shares held in treasury to satisfy stock
        option exercises under the Executive Stock Option Plan. 

The
        adoption of SFAS No. 123R decreased the Company's reported operating income,
        income before income taxes and reported net income for the first two quarters
        of
        fiscal year 2006 by $184,000, and reduced both basic and diluted net income
        per
        share by $0.01. The expense, before income tax effect, is reflected in general
        and administrative expenses. The Company's adoption of SFAS No. 123R did
        not
        affect operating income, income before income taxes, net income, cash flow
        from
        operations, cash flow from financing activities, or basic and diluted net
        income
        per share in the comparable period of fiscal year 2005. 

16 

Partly
        in
        anticipation of the adoption of SFAS No.123R, in recent years the Company
        has
        adjusted the mix of employee long-term incentive compensation by reducing
        stock
        options awarded and increasing certain cash based compensation and other
        equity
        based awards. Compensation cost for share-based payment arrangements recognized
        in general and administrative expenses for the first two quarters of fiscal
        year
        2006 was $184,000 for stock options and $97,000 for restricted stock. The
        total
        income tax effect of these expenses was offset by a valuation allowance and,
        therefore, no benefit was recognized in the income statement for the first
        two
        quarters of fiscal year 2006 for share-based compensation
        arrangements. 

The
        fair
        value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the
        Black-Scholes option pricing model, which determines inputs as shown in the
        following table. Because of differences in option terms and historical exercise
        patterns among the plans, the Company has segregated option awards into three
        homogenous groups for the purpose of determining fair values for its options.
        Valuation assumptions are determined separately for the three groups which
        represent, respectively, the Executive Stock Option Plan, the Employee Stock
        Plans and the Non-employee Director Stock Option Plan. The assumptions are
        as
        follows: 

The
        Company estimated volatility using its historical share price performance
        over
        the expected life of the option. Management considered the guidance in SFAS
        No.
        123R and believes the historical estimated volatility is materially indicative
        of expectations about expected future volatility. 

The
        Company uses the simplified method outlined in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
        No.
        107 to estimate expected lives for options granted during the
        period. 

The
        risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect
        at
        the time of grant for the expected term of the option.  

The
        expected dividend yield is based on the Company's current dividend yield
        and the
        best estimate of projected dividend yield for future periods within the expected
        life of the option. 

A
        summary
        of the Company's stock option activity as of February 15, 2006, and changes
        during the first two quarters of fiscal year 2006 is presented in the following
        table: 

17 

The
        weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the first
        two
        quarters of fiscal year 2006 was $  6.72
          per
        share. The intrinsic value for stock options is defined as the difference
        between the current market value and the grant price. The total intrinsic
        value
        of options exercised during the first two quarters of fiscal year 2006 was
        $  390,000  . 

Restricted
        stock grants consist of the Company's common stock and generally vest after
        three years, except the current grants under the Nonemployee Director Stock
        Option Plan, which vest when granted. All restricted stock grants are cliff
        vested. Generally, the fair value of each restricted stock grant is equal
        to the
        market price of the Company's stock at the date of grant. 

A
        summary
        of the Company's restricted stock activity at February 15, 2006, and changes
        during the first two quarters of fiscal year 2006, is presented in the following
        table: 

At
        February 15, 2006, there was $  1.6
          million
        of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based
        compensation arrangements that is expected to be recognized over a
        weighted-average period of 3.52 years. During the first two quarters of fiscal
        year 2006,   6,516
          shares
        of
        restricted stock grants vested. 

During
        the first two quarters of fiscal year 2006, cash received from options exercised
        was $  937,000
          and
        the
        calculated but unrecognized tax benefit for the tax deductions from stock
        options exercised totaled $  127,000  . 

Discontinued
        Operations   

        In
        November 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) reached a consensus on
        EITF 03-13,  Applying the Conditions in Paragraph 42 of SFAS No. 144 in
        Determining Whether to Report Discontinued Operations,  which provides guidance
        on how to evaluate the discontinued operations criteria. The consensus should
        be
        applied in fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2004. The Company
        has
        applied the consensus effective fiscal year 2006, with no significant effect
        on
        reporting of discontinued operations. (See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated
        Financial Statements.) 

Rental
        Costs During Construction   

        In
        October 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued FASB
        Staff Position No. 13-1 ( FSP 13-1 ), which addresses the accounting for rental
        costs associated with building and ground operating leases that are incurred
        during a construction period. The FASB decided that such rental costs incurred
        during a construction period shall be recognized as rental expense. A lessee
        shall cease capitalizing rental costs as of the effective date of FSP 13-1
        for
        operating lease arrangements entered into prior to the effective date of
        FSP
        13-1. The guidance in FSP 13-1 has been applied during the first quarter
        of
        fiscal year 2006. Because it has been the Company s practice to charge rental
        costs during construction periods to expense, the adoption of FSP 13-1 has
        not
        had, and will not have, an impact on the Company s financial position, results
        of operations or cash flows.

Net
                  Earnings Per Share  

Basic
        net
        income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common
        shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
        for the
        reporting period. Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution
        that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were
        exercised or converted into common stock. For the calculation of diluted
        net
        income per share, the basic weighted average number of shares is increased
        by
        the dilutive effect of restricted stock, phantom stock, and stock options
        determined using the treasury stock method. Stock options with exercise prices
        exceeding current market prices that were excluded from the computation of
        net
        income per share amounted to 59,000 shares and 618,000 shares for the quarters
        ended February 15, 2006 and February 9, 2005, respectively. For the two quarters
        ended February 15, 2006 and February 9, 2005, respectively, the Company had
        approximately 107,000 and 750,000 stock options outstanding that were not
        included in the diluted earnings per share calculation because the effect
        would
        have been antidilutive.  

The
        components of basic and diluted net income per share are as
        follows:

Management s
                  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
                  Operations  

Management's
        discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
        should
        be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes
        for the periods ended February 15, 2006, and the audited financial statements
        filed on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2005. 

Overview   

        As
        of
        March 17, 2006, the Company operated 128 restaurants under the name
        "Luby's."  These establishments are located in close proximity
        to
        retail centers, business developments, and residential areas throughout five
        states.  Of the 128 restaurants, 93 are at locations owned
        by the
        Company and 35 are on leased premises.  Two of the restaurants
        primarily serve seafood, 4 are full-time buffets, 7 are cafeteria-style
        restaurants with all-you-can-eat options, and 115 are traditional cafeterias.

Not
        included in the currently operating units is one leased, traditional
        cafeteria-style restaurant which has been temporarily closed due to storm
        damage. The Company is actively pursuing the restoration of this site s
        operation. 

Reclassification   

        Store
        management compensation has been reclassified from  Other Operating Expenses  to
 Payroll and Related Costs  to provide comparability to financial results
        reported by our peers in the industry. Prior period results reported have
        been
        reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 

The
        Company's business plan, as approved in fiscal year 2003, called for the
        closure
        of approximately 50 locations. In accordance with the plan, the entire fiscal
        activity of the applicable stores closed after the inception of the plan
        have
        been reclassified to discontinued operations. For comparison purposes, prior
        period results related to these same locations have also been reclassified
        to
        discontinued operations. 

Accounting
        Periods   

        The
        Company's fiscal year ends on the last Wednesday in August. As such, each
        fiscal
        year normally consists of 13 four-week periods, accounting for 364 days.
        Each of
        the first three quarters of each fiscal year consists of three four-week
        periods, while the fourth quarter normally consists of four four-week periods.
        Comparability between accounting periods may be affected by varying lengths
        of
        the periods, as well as the seasonality associated with the restaurant
        business. 

Same-Store Sales   

        The
        restaurant business is highly competitive with respect to food quality, concept,
        location, price, and service, all of which may have an effect on same-store
        sales. The Company's same-store sales calculation measures the relative
        performance of a certain group of restaurants. Specifically, to qualify for
        inclusion in this group, a store must have been in operation for 18 consecutive
        accounting periods. Although management believes this approach leads to more
        effective year-over-year comparisons, neither the time frame nor the exact
        practice may be similar to those used by other restaurant
        companies. 

Hurricane
        Impact   

        Hurricane
        Rita impacted a number of the Company s markets during the first quarter of 2006
        as Luby s was forced to temporarily close many stores due to mandatory
        evacuations and subsequent power outages. The Company experienced a store
        closure impact of 236 store days of operations due to Hurricane Rita. One
        unit
        in Port Arthur, Texas suffered permanent damage and remains closed. All other
        restaurants impacted by the storm suffered minimal damage and were reopened
        soon
        after the storm passed. The store closure impact on the Company s results of
        operations was offset by increased traffic at certain units and catering
        events
        relating to the hurricane relief effort. 

RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS  

Quarter ended February
        15, 2006 compared to the quarter ended February
        9,
        2005   

        Sales
        increased approximately $4.1 million, or 5.7%, in the second quarter of fiscal
        year 2006 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2005. On a same-store
        basis, sales increased $4.7 million or 6.7%, excluding one unit that was
        open in
        the second quarter of 2005 but was temporarily closed due to storm damage
        throughout the second quarter of 2006. 

20 

Food
        costs increased approximately $1.2 million, or 6.2%, in the second quarter
        of
        fiscal year 2006 compared with the same quarter of fiscal year 2005. Food
        costs
        as a percentage of sales increased 0.1%. Price increases were experienced
        in
        commodity sectors, such as seafood, shortenings, oils and fresh produce.
        The
        Company continues to manage food costs by offering menu items and combination
        meals with favorable cost structures and by employing a variety of other
        cost
        control measures. 

Payroll
        and related costs increased approximately $  0.6
        million  ,
        or
  2.25  %,
        in the
        second quarter of fiscal year 2006 compared with the same quarter of fiscal
        year
        2005. Payroll and related costs as a percentage of sales decreased 1.2%,
        largely
        due to continued operational focus on efficient labor utilization, offset
        by
        estimated costs associated with the anticipated settlement of pending labor
        related claims, as discussed in Note 8.  

Other
        operating expenses increased by approximately $  1.9
        million  ,
        or
  13.0  %,
        in the
        second quarter of fiscal year 2006 compared with the same quarter of fiscal
        year
        2005. As a percentage of sales, other operating expenses increased 1.4%,
        driven by increased utility costs primarily due to rising natural
        gas
        prices and higher repairs and maintenance costs  
        associated with required repairs at store facilities.  

Depreciation
        expense for the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 was unchanged from the
        same
        period of fiscal year 2005 because acquisitions of property and equipment
        during
        interim periods have been largely offset by dispositions. 

Relocation
        and voluntary severance costs decreased by approximately $0.3 million because
        relocation activity occurred primarily during the first and second quarters
        of
        fiscal year 2005.  

General
        and administrative expenses increased by approximately $0.6 million, or 12.0%,
        when compared to the same quarter of the prior year.  As a
        percentage
        of sales, general and administrative expenses increased 0.4% primarily due
        to
        increased staffing and salary market adjustments, stock-based compensation
        expenses and continued consulting fees associated with the integration of
        new
        point-of-sale and accounting systems. 

The
        provision for (reversal of) asset impairments and restaurant closings increased
        by approximately $0.3 million due primarily to the write-off of obsolete
        equipment. 

Interest
        expense, net, decreased approximately $  0.8
        million  ,
        or
  80.9  %,
        as a
        result of the Company s reduction in outstanding debt and lower interest
        rates. 

Other
        income increased primarily due to increased prepaid sales tax discounts from
        higher sales in the second quarter of 2006. 

Income
        tax expense for the current quarter represents a provision for alternative
        minimum tax. No regular income tax expense was recorded in the current quarter
        or prior year due to the utilization of net operating loss
        carryforwards.  (See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
        Statements.) 

In
        connection with locations that were closed as part of the Company s business
        plan, lease settlement costs and impairment charges incurred in the current
        year
        coupled with gains on property disposals recognized in the prior year caused
        an
        increase of approximately $6,000 in loss from discontinued operations. The
        gains
        and loss impairments recorded in this category relate to properties closed
        after
        the adoption of SFAS No. 144. 

Two
        quarters ended February 15, 2006 compared to the
        two quarters ended February 9, 2005   

        Sales
        increased approximately $8.9 million, or 6.4%, for the first two quarters
        of
        fiscal 2006 compared to the same two quarters of fiscal 2005.   On
        a
        same-store basis, excluding approximately $140,000 and $1.2 million in sales
        for
        the first two quarters in fiscal year 2006 and 2005, respectively, from a
        unit
        closed during the current quarter due to storm damage, sales increased $10.0
        million or 7.2%. 

Food
        costs increased $2.0 million, or 5.1%, in the first two quarters of fiscal
        2006
        compared with the same two quarters of fiscal 2005. As a percentage of sales,
        food costs decreased from 27.4% to 27.0%. During the fiscal year 2006, the
        Company promoted combination meals with favorable cost structures, which
        partially offset the impact of some higher commodity prices. 

Payroll
        and related costs increased $1.2 million, or 2.4%, in the first two quarters
        of
        fiscal 2006 compared with the prior year fiscal period. As a percentage of
        sales, these costs decreased from 36.3%, to 35.0%, in the first two quarters
        of
        fiscal 2006 compared with the same two quarters of fiscal 2005. The Company
        benefited from enhanced productivity during fiscal 2006.  

21 

Other
        operating expenses increased by $2.2 million, or 7.2%, for the first two
        quarters of fiscal 2006 compared to the same two quarters of fiscal 2005.
        As a
        percentage of sales, these costs increased 0.2%, driven predominantly
        by higher utilities costs primarily due to rising natural gas prices,
        higher repair and maintenance expenses associated with   required
        repairs at store facilities and increased restaurant supply costs.  

Depreciation
        and amortization expense increased by approximately $14,000, or 0.2%, in
        the
        first two quarters of fiscal 2006 compared with the same two quarters of
        fiscal
        2005 due to a reduction in the depreciable base of the Company s property and
        equipment. 

During
        the first two quarters of 2005, the Company incurred costs of approximately
        $0.6
        million related to the relocation of its headquarters. No such costs were
        incurred during the comparable period in 2006. 

General
        and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1.2 million, or 13.9%,
          in
        the
        first two quarters of fiscal 2006 compared with the same two quarters of
        fiscal
        2005  .
         Increased staffing and salary market adjustments, stock-based compensation
        expenses, and consulting fees associated with the integration of new
        point-of-sale and accounting system attributed to the increase. 

The
        provision for (reversal of) asset impairments and restaurant closings decreased
        by approximately $0.1 million,   in
        the
        first two quarters of fiscal 2006 compared with the same two quarters of
        fiscal
        2005.    This
        is due to fewer store closures. 

Interest
        expense, net, decreased $1.2 million, or 73.4%, in the first two quarters
        of
        fiscal 2006 compared with the same two quarters of fiscal 2005 as a result
        of
        the Company s considerable reduction in outstanding debt and lower interest
        rates following the prior year s refinancing. 

Other
        income increased by approximately $279,000   in
        the
        first two quarters of fiscal 2006 compared with the same two quarters of
        fiscal
        2005  
        primarily due to refund received on sales tax return and an adjustment made
        to
        the accrual for sales tax audit. 

Income
        tax expense for the current quarter represents a provision for alternative
        minimum tax. No regular income tax expense was recorded in the current or
        prior
        year due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards.  (See
        Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

The
        loss
        from discontinued operations increased by $0.5 million in the first two quarters
        of fiscal 2006 compared with the same two quarters of fiscal 2005 principally
        due to lease termination costs and impairments on properties held for
        sale. 

ADJUSTED
          EBITDA  

EBITDA
          is
          a commonly used non-GAAP valuation statistic that is derived from the Income
          (Loss) From Operations, which is a GAAP measurement. As presented herein,
          Adjusted EBITDA represents a non-traditional calculation of EBITDA as defined
          in
          the Company's Revolving Credit Facility generally as the consolidated income
          (loss) from operations set forth in the Company's consolidated statements
          of
          operations before depreciation, amortization, other non-cash expenses,
          interest
          expense, taxes, non-cash income and extraordinary gains or losses, and
          other
          nonrecurring items of income or expense as approved by the required lenders.
          Adjusted EBITDA is the denominator used in determining all of the financial
          covenant ratios that are measured against predefined limits for compliance
          under
          the Company s Revolving Credit Facility. (See  Debt,  Note 6 of Notes to
          Consolidated Financial Statements). Noncompliance with any of the financial
          covenants would constitute an event of default under the Company s Revolving
          Credit Facility, requiring the Company to obtain replacement financing
          to repay
          amounts owed under these agreements and to meet future working capital
          requirements. Management believes that such replacement financing would
          be
          available and that the cost of such financing would not have a significant
          effect on the Company s liquidity or results of operations. 

Compared
          to the results for the first two quarters of fiscal 2005, Adjusted EBITDA
          increased by $2.5 million, for the first two quarters of fiscal 2006, due
          to the
          various applicable reasons noted in the Results of Operations section
          above.   

22 

The
        following table reconciles the Company s non-GAAP financial measure, Adjusted
        EBITDA, with Income from Operations, prepared in accordance with
        GAAP. 

As
          previously noted, prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform
          to the
          current year presentation, including the applicable reclassifications of
          store
          activity discontinued in accordance with the implementation of the business
          plan.  While the Company and many in the financial community
          consider
          Adjusted EBITDA to be an important supplemental valuation statistic, it
          should
          be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to,
          measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, such
          as
          operating income and net income.

        Equivalents and Working Capital   

        Cash
        and

        end of the preceding fiscal year to February 15, 2006, primarily due to cash
        flows from operations and proceeds from sales of properties, partially offset
        by
        debt repayment and capital expenditures. 

The
        Company had a working capital deficit of $  21.7
          million
        at February 15, 2006, which represents a $4.5 million decrease from the $26.2
        million deficit at August 31, 2005.  The Company's working
        capital
        requirements are expected to be met through cash flows from operations and
        availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. 

Capital
        expenditures for the two quarters ended February 15, 2006, were $  6.1
          million.  Consistent
        with prior periods, the Company used most of its capital funds to maintain
        its
        investment in existing operating units.  Based on the business
        plan,
        the Company expects to fund all capital expenditures in fiscal year 2006
        using
        cash flows from operations and expects to spend a total of approximately
        $  16  
        million
        to $  18  
        million
        for the fiscal year. 

Debt   

        On
        August
        31, 2005, Luby s, Inc. entered into an amended and restated $45.0 million
        unsecured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the  Revolving Credit Facility )
        among Luby s, Inc. and a syndicate of three independent banks. The Revolving
        Credit Facility may, subject to certain terms and conditions, be increased
        by an
        additional $15.0 million for a total facility size of $60.0 million. The
        Revolving Credit Facility allows up to $10.0 million of the available credit
        to
        be extended in the form of letters of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility
        terminates, and all amounts owing thereunder must be repaid, August 31,
        2008. 

23 

At
        any
        time throughout the term of the loan, the Company has the option to elect
        one of
        two bases of interest rates. One interest rate option is the greater of (a)
        the
        federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, or (b) prime, plus, in either case,
        an
        applicable spread that ranges from 0% to 0.25% per annum. The other interest
        rate option is LIBOR (London InterBank Offered Rate) plus an applicable spread
        that ranges from 1.00% to 1.75% per annum. The applicable spread under each
        option is dependent upon certain measures of the Company s financial performance
        at the time of election. 

The
        Company also pays a quarterly commitment fee based on the unused portion
        of the
        Revolving Credit Facility, which is also dependent upon the Company s financial
        performance, ranging from 0.25% to 0.35% per annum. The Company also is
        obligated to pay certain fees in respect of any letters of credit issued
        as well
        as an administrative fee to the lender acting as administrative agent. Finally,
        the Company paid the lenders a one-time fee in connection with the closing
        of
        the Revolving Credit Facility. 

The
        Revolving Credit Facility contains customary covenants and restrictions on
        the
        Company s ability to engage in certain activities, including financial
        performance covenants and limitations on capital expenditures, asset sales
        and
        acquisitions, and contains customary events of default. As of February 15,
        2006,
        the Company was in full compliance with all covenants. 

All
        amounts owed by Luby s, Inc. under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed
        by its subsidiaries. 

The
        Company primarily used proceeds received on the sale of properties, operating
        cash flows, short-term investments and the Revolving Credit Facility to pay
        off
        its prior term loan and prior line of credit. As of February 15, 2006, the
        Company had total debt of $7.2 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit
        Facility.  

Additionally,
        at February 15, 2006, the Company had a total of approximately $5.8 million
        committed under letters of credit which have been issued as security for
        the
        payment of insurance obligations classified as accrued expenses on the balance
        sheet. Of these letters of credit, approximately $5.1 were issued under the
        Revolving Credit Facility. An additional $700,000 in letters of credit, issued
        under a separate arrangement with one of the banks in the Revolving Credit
        Facility group, are collateralized by held-to-maturity time deposits. As
        of
        March 2, 2006, the total amount committed under letters of credit was reduced
        to
        $5.1 million.  

CRITICAL
        ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

The
        consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally
        accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparation of the
        financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions
        that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements
        and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We believe the following
        are the Company s critical accounting policies due to the significant,
        subjective and complex judgments and estimates used when preparing our
        consolidated financial statements. We regularly review our assumptions and
        estimates with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Company s Board of
        Directors. 

Income
        Taxes   

        The
        Company records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences
        between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the
        accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax
        credit carrybacks and carryforwards. The Company periodically reviews the
        recoverability of tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provides
        valuation allowances as management deems necessary. Management makes judgments
        as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an
        audit
        and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In addition, the
        Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit
        in
        these jurisdictions. In management's opinion, adequate provisions for income
        taxes have been made for all years. Historically, the Company s federal income
        tax returns have been periodically reviewed by the Internal Revenue Service
        ( IRS ). The Company s returns are currently under review for the 2003, 2002,
        2001, and 2000 fiscal years. The IRS review may result in a reduction of
        the
        cumulative net operating losses ($9.3 million at February 15, 2006) that
        are
        currently being carried forward to offset future taxable
        income. 

24 

Impairment
        of Long-Lived Assets   

        The
        Company periodically evaluates long-lived assets whenever events or changes
        in
        circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
        recoverable. The Company estimates future cash flows expected to result from
        the
        use and possible disposition of the asset and will recognize an impairment
        loss
        when the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows is less than
        the
        carrying amounts of such assets. The estimates of future cash flows, based
        on
        reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management's
        subjective judgments. The span of time for which future cash flows are estimated
        is often lengthy, which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made. Depending
        on the assumptions and estimates used, the estimated future cash flows projected
        in the evaluation of long-lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes.
        The Company considers the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining
        the
        best estimate of future cash flows. The measurement for such an impairment
        loss
        is then based on the fair value of the asset as determined by discounted
        cash
        flows or appraisals, if available. 

Property
        Held for Sale    

        The
        Company also periodically reviews long-lived assets against its plans to
        retain
        or ultimately dispose of properties. If the Company decides to dispose of
        a
        property, it will be reclassified to property held for sale and actively
        marketed. Property held for sale is recorded at amounts not in excess of
        what
        management currently expects to receive upon sale, less costs of disposal
        or net
        remaining depreciable book value, if lower. The Company routinely monitors
        the
        estimated value of property held for sale and records adjustments to these
        values as required. The Company periodically measures and analyzes its estimates
        against third-party appraisals.  

Insurance
        and Claims   

        The
        Company self-insures a significant portion of risks and associated liabilities
        under its employee injury, workers compensation and general liability programs.
        The Company maintains insurance coverage with third party carriers to limit
        its
        per-occurrence claim exposure. Accrued liabilities have been recorded based
        upon
        analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates, and are reviewed by
        the
        Company on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is
        reasonable. 

Actual
        workers  compensation and employee injury claims expense may differ from
        estimated loss provisions. The Company cannot make any assurances as to the
        ultimate level of claims under the in-house safety program or whether declines
        in incidence of claims as well as claims costs experiences or reductions
        in
        reserve requirements under the program will continue in future
        periods. 

RECENTLY
        ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

Prior
        to
        September 1, 2005, the Company accounted for its stock based compensation
        under
        the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board
        ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related
        interpretations, the disclosure only provisions of Statement of Financial
        Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation"
        and the disclosures required by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based
        Compensation Transition and Disclosure." In accordance with APB Opinion No.
        25,
        no stock based compensation cost was reflected in the Company's prior year
        net
        loss for grants of stock options to employees because the Company grants
        stock
        options with an exercise price equal to the market value of the stock on
        the
        date of grant. 

Effective
        September 1, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions
        of
        SFAS No. 123R, as discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
        contained in this Quarterly Report. The Company elected to adopt using the
        modified prospective method, under which, compensation cost in the first
        quarter
        of fiscal year 2006 includes the portion vesting in the period for (a) all
        share
        based payments granted prior to, but not vested as of August 31, 2005, based
        on
        the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions
        of SFAS No. 123 and (b) all share based payments granted subsequent to August
        31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated using the Black Scholes
        option pricing model. Before adoption of SFAS No. 123R, pro forma disclosure
        reflected the fair value of each option grant estimated on the date of grant
        using the Black Scholes option pricing model (See Note 11 of Notes to
        Consolidated Financial Statements herein for the weighted average assumptions
        used in fiscal year 2005). Under SFAS No. 123R, the Company estimated volatility
        using its historical share price performance over the expected life of the
        option. Management considered the guidance in SFAS No. 123R and believes
        the
        historical estimated volatility is materially indicative of expectations
        about
        expected future volatility. Management believes the Company meets the
        requirements in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, allowing the Company
        to
        use the simplified method to estimate expected lives for option grants. The
        risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect
        at
        the time of grant for the expected term of the option. The expected dividend
        yield is based on the Company's current dividend yield and the best estimate
        of
        projected dividend yield for future periods within the expected life of the
        option. 

25 

Results
        of prior periods do not reflect any restated amounts, and the Company had
        no
        cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R under the modified
        prospective method. The Company's policy is to recognize compensation cost
        for
        awards with service only conditions and a graded vesting schedule on a straight
        line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Additionally,
        the Company's policy is to reserve shares held for treasury to satisfy stock
        option exercises under the Company s Executive Stock Option Plan. 

The
        adoption of SFAS No. 123R decreased the Company's reported operating income,
        income before income taxes and reported net income for the first two quarters
        of
        fiscal year 2006 by $184,000, and reduced both basic and diluted net income
        per
        share by $0.01. The expense, before income tax effect, is in general and
        administrative expense The Company's adoption of SFAS No. 123R did not affect
        operating income, loss before income taxes, net loss, cash flow from operations,
        cash flow from financing activities, basic and diluted net loss per share
        in the
        first two quarters of fiscal year 2005. 

Partly
        in
        anticipation of the adoption of SFAS No.123R, in recent years the Company
        has
        adjusted the mix of employee long-term incentive compensation by reducing
        stock
        options awarded and increasing certain cash based compensation and other
        equity
        based awards. Compensation cost for share based payment arrangements recognized
        in general and administrative expenses for the first two quarters of fiscal
        year
        2006 was $184,000 for stock options and $97,000 for restricted stock
        grants. 

At
        February 15, 2006, there was $1.6 million of total unrecognized compensation
        cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements that is expected
        to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.52 years. During the
        first
        two quarters of fiscal year 2006, 6,516 shares of restricted stock grants
        vested. 

In
        November 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) reached a consensus on
        EITF 03-13,  Applying the Conditions in Paragraph 42 of SFAS No. 144 in
        Determining Whether to Report Discontinued Operations,  which provides guidance
        on how to evaluate the discontinued operations criteria. The consensus should
        be
        applied in fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2004. The Company
        has
        applied the consensus effective fiscal year 2006, with no significant effect
        on
        reporting of discontinued operations. 

In
        October 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued FASB
        Staff Position No. 13-1 ( FSP 13-1 ), which addresses the accounting for rental
        costs associated with building and ground operating leases that are incurred
        during a construction period. The FASB decided that such rental costs incurred
        during a construction period shall be recognized as rental expense. A lessee
        shall cease capitalizing rental costs as of the effective date of FSP 13-1
        for
        operating lease arrangements entered into prior to the effective date of
        FSP
        13-1. The guidance in FSP 13-1 has been applied during the first quarter
        of
        fiscal year 2006. Because it has been the Company s practice to charge rental
        costs during construction periods to expense, the adoption of FSP 13-1 has
        not,
        and will not have an impact on the Company s financial position, results of
        operations or cash flows. 

INFLATION  

The
        Company's policy is to maintain stable menu prices without regard to seasonal
        variations in food costs. General increases in costs of food, wages, supplies,
        transportation, and services make it necessary for the Company to increase
        its
        menu prices from time to time. To the extent prevailing market conditions
        allow,
        the Company intends to adjust menu prices to maintain profit margins.

Quantitative
                    and Qualitative Disclosures About
                    Market Risk 

The
        Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates affecting
        its
        variable-rate debt. As of February 15, 2006, $7.2 million, the total amount
        of
        debt subject to interest rate fluctuations, was outstanding under the Revolving
        Credit Facility.

Controls
                    and Procedures  

Evaluation
        of Disclosure Control and Procedures   

        The
        Company s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the
        Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the
        effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term
        is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
        amended (the  Exchange Act ), as of February 15, 2006. Based on such evaluation,
        the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
        that, as of February 15, 2006, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
        were effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting information
        required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits
        under the Exchange Act within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
        forms. 

Changes
        in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

            There
        were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting
        during the quarter ended February 15, 2006 that have materially affected,
        or are
        reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over
        financial reporting.

3.       Eligibility   .
      All
      employees of any of the following entities are eligible to receive Awards under
      the Plan: (i) the Company, (ii) any corporation or other entity that has elected
      to be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes (collectively
       Entities ), other than the Company, in an unbroken chain of Entities beginning
      with the Company if each of the Entities other than the last Entity in the

      in
      (i) and (ii) are eligible to receive Awards under the Plan. 

4.       Common
      Stock Available for Awards   .
      Subject
      to the adjustment provisions of Section 10, the number of shares of Common
      Stock
      that may be issued for Awards granted under the Plan is equal to the sum of:
      (a)
      2,100,000 shares; (b) any shares of Common Stock that were authorized to be
      awarded under the 1989 Plan but were not awarded under the 1989 Plan; and (c)
      any shares of Common Stock represented by awards granted under the 1989 Plan
      which have been or will be forfeited, expire, or canceled without delivery
      of
      Common Stock, or which have resulted or will result in the forfeiture of Common
      Stock back to the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum aggregate
      number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan is 2,600,000.
      Any of the authorized shares may be used for any of the types of Awards
      described in the Plan. No Participant may receive, under the Plan, stock options
      for more than 100,000 shares in any one year, except that stock options may
      be
      granted to a newly hired employee for not more than 200,000 shares in the first
      year of employment. Shares of Common stock related to Awards which (i) are
      forfeited, (ii) expire unexercised, (iii) are settled in such manner that all
      or
      some of the shares covered by an Award are not issued to a Participant, (iv)
      are
      exchanged for Awards that do not involve Common Stock, or (v) are tendered
      by a
      Participant upon exercise of a stock option in payment of all or a portion
      of
      the option price shall be added back to the pool and shall immediately become
      available for Awards. 

5.       Awards   .
      The
      Committee shall select the persons who are to receive Awards and shall determine
      the type or types of Award(s) to be made to each Participant and shall set
      forth
      in the related Award Agreement the terms, conditions, performance requirements,
      and limitations applicable to each Award. Awards may be granted singly, in
      combination, or in tandem. Awards may include but are not limited to the
      following: 

(a)      Nonqualified
      Stock Options   .
      A
      nonqualified stock option is a right to purchase a specified number of shares
      of
      Common Stock at a fixed option price equal to the Fair Market Value of the
      Common Stock on the date the Award is granted, during a specified time, not
      to
      exceed ten years, as the Committee may determine. The option price shall be
      payable: 

(i)     in
      U.S.
      dollars by personal check, bank draft, or by money order payable to the order
      of
      the Company or by money transfer or direct account debit; or 

(ii)     if
      the
      Committee so determines, through the delivery of shares of Common Stock of
      the
      Company with a Fair Market Value equal to all or a portion of the option price
      for the total number of options being exercised; or 

(iii)     by
      a
      combination of the methods described in subsections (i) and (ii) next
      above. 

(b)      Incentive
      Stock Options   .
      An
      incentive stock option ( ISO ) is an Award which, in addition to being subject
      to applicable terms, conditions, and limitations established by the Committee,
      complies with Section 422 of the Code. Among other limitations, Section 422
      of
      the Code currently provides (i) that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined
      at the time the option is granted) of Common Stock for which ISOs are
      exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year shall
      not exceed $100,000, (ii) that ISOs shall be priced at not less than 100% of
      the
      Fair Market Value on the date of the grant, and (iii) that ISOs shall be
      exercisable for a period of not more than ten years. The Committee may provide
      that the option price under an ISO can be paid by one or more of the methods
      described in subsection (a) next above. 

(c)      Restricted
      Stock   .
      Restricted Stock is Common Stock of the Company that is subject to restrictions
      on transfer and/or such other restrictions on incidents of ownership as the
      Committee may determine, for a required period of continued employment of not
      less than three years as set by the Committee at the time of Award. Restricted
      Stock Awards shall require no payments of consideration by the Participant,
      either on the date of grant or the date the restriction(s) are removed, unless
      specifically required by the terms of the Award Agreement. 

(d)      Performance
      Shares   .
      A
      Performance Share is Common Stock of the Company, or a unit valued by reference
      to Common Stock, that is subject to restrictions on transfer and/or such other
      restrictions on incidents of ownership as the Committee may determine. The
      elimination of restrictions on a Performance Share and the number of shares
      ultimately earned by a Participant shall be contingent upon achievement of
      one
      or more performance targets specified by the Committee. Performance Shares
      may
      be paid in Common Stock, cash, or a combination thereof. The Committee shall
      establish minimum performance targets with respect to each Performance Share.
      Performance targets may be based on financial criteria consisting of (i) revenue
      growth, (ii) diluted earnings per share, (iii) net operating profit after taxes,
      (iv) cash flow, (v) economic value added, or (vi) a combination of such
      criteria. No Participant may receive, under the Plan, a Performance Share Award
      for any award cycle in excess of 25,000 performance units or 25,000 shares
      of
      Common Stock. 

6.       Certain
      Changes   .
      Except
      as may be permitted under the provisions of Section 10 or Section
      11,       no
      stock
      option issued pursuant to the Plan may be (i) canceled by the Company or (ii)
      amended so as to reduce the option price, unless such cancellation or amendment
      is approved by the shareholders of the Company. 

7.       Award
      Agreements   .
      Each
      Award under this Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement consistent with
      the provisions of the Plan setting forth the terms and conditions applicable
      to
      the Award. Award Agreements shall include: 

(a)      Nonassignability   .
      With
      respect to nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options and Performance
      Shares, a provision that no Award shall be assignable or transferable except
      by
      will or by the laws of descent and distribution and that during the lifetime
      of
      a Participant, the Award shall be exercised only by such
      Participant. 

(b)      Termination
      of Employment   .
      Provisions governing the disposition of an Award in the event of the retirement,
      disability, death, or other termination of a Participant's employment or
      relationship to the Company or any affiliate of the Company. 

(c)      Rights
      as a Shareholder   .
      A
      provision that a Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect
      to any shares covered by an Award until the date the Participant or his nominee
      becomes the holder of record. Except as provided in Section 9 hereof, no
      adjustment shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record
      date
      is prior to such date, unless the Award Agreement specifically requires such
      adjustment. 

(d)      Withholding   .
      A
      provision requiring the withholding of all taxes required by law from all
      amounts paid in cash. In the case of payments of Awards in shares of Common
      Stock, the Participant may be required to pay the amount of any taxes required
      to be withheld prior to receipt of such shares. A Participant must in all
      instances pay the required withholding taxes in cash. The withholding of shares
      to pay taxes shall not be permitted. 

(e)      Other
      Provisions   .
      Such
      other terms and conditions, including the criteria for determining vesting
      of
      Awards and the amount or value of Awards, as the Committee determines to be
      necessary or appropriate. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
      any
      stock option granted under the Plan may provide, if the Committee so determines,
      that upon the occurrence of a  change of control  (as defined in Section 11) the
      option shall immediately become exercisable and shall remain exercisable for
      a
      period of one year after termination of the optionee s employment but not later
      than the expiration date of the option. 

8.       Administration   .
        The
      Plan
      shall be administered by the Committee, which shall have full and exclusive
      power to interpret the Plan, to grant waivers of Award restrictions, and to
      adopt such rules, regulations, and guidelines for carrying out the Plan as
      it
      may deem necessary or proper, all of which powers shall be executed in the
      best
      interests of the Company and in keeping with the objectives of the Plan. All
      questions of interpretation and administration with respect to the Plan and
      Award Agreements shall be determined by the Committee, and its determination
      shall be final and conclusive. The Committee may delegate to the Chief Executive
      Officer of the Company its administrative functions and authority to grant
      Awards under the Plan pursuant to such conditions and limitations as the
      Committee may establish, except that only the Committee may select, and grant
      Awards to, Participants who are subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange
      Act of 1934. 

9.       Amendment,
      Modification, Suspension, or Discontinuance of the Plan   .
      The
      Board may amend, modify, suspend, or terminate the Plan for the purpose of
      meeting or addressing any changes in legal requirements or for any other purpose
      permitted by law. Subject to changes in law or other legal requirements that
      would permit otherwise, the Plan may not be amended without the consent of
      the
      holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding (i) to
      increase the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued
      under
      the Plan (except for adjustments pursuant to Section 9 of the Plan), (ii) to
      decrease the option price, (iii) to materially modify the requirements as to
      eligibility for participation in the Plan, (iv) to withdraw administration
      of
      the Plan from the Committee, or (v) to extend the period during which Awards
      may
      be granted. 

10.       Adjustments   .
      In the
      event of any change in the outstanding Common Stock of the Company by reason
      of
      a stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of shares,
      recapitalization, merger, or similar event, the Committee may adjust
      proportionally (a) the number of shares of Common Stock (i) reserved under
      the
      Plan, (ii) for which Awards may be granted to an individual Participant, and
      (iii) covered by outstanding Awards denominated in stock or units of stock;
      (b)
      the stock prices related to outstanding Awards; and (c) the appropriate Fair
      Market Value and other price determinations for such Awards. In the event of
      any
      other change affecting the Common Stock or any distribution (other than normal
      cash dividends) to holders of Common Stock, such adjustments as may be deemed
      equitable by the Committee, including adjustments to avoid fractional shares,
      may be made to give proper effect to such event. In the event of a corporate
      merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, separation,
      reorganization or liquidation, the Committee shall be authorized to issue or
      assume stock options, whether or not in a transaction to which Section 424(a)
      of
      the Code applies, by means of substitution of new stock options for previously
      issued stock options or an assumption of previously issued stock options. The
      issuance of new stock options for previously issued stock options or the
      assumption of previously issued stock options in connection with a corporate
      merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, separation,
      reorganization or liquidation shall not reduce the number of shares of Common
      stock available for Awards under the Plan. 

11.       Change
      of Control   .
      (a) In
      the event of a change of control of the Company, or if the Board reaches
      agreement to merge or consolidate with another corporation and the Company
      is
      not the surviving corporation or if all, or substantially all, of the assets
      of
      the Company are sold, or if the Company shall make a distribution to
      shareholders that is nontaxable under the Code, or if the Company shall dissolve
      or liquidate (a "Restructuring Event"), then the Committee may, in its
      discretion, recommend that the Board take any of the following actions as a
      result of, or in anticipation of, any such Restructuring Event to assure fair
      and equitable treatment of Participants: 

(i)     accelerate
      time periods for purposes of vesting in, or realizing gain from, any outstanding
      Award made pursuant to the Plan; 

(ii)     offer
      to
      purchase any outstanding Award made pursuant to the Plan from the holder for
      its
      equivalent cash value, as determined by the Committee, as of the date of the
      Restructuring Event; and 

(iii)     make
      adjustments or modifications to outstanding Awards as the Committee deems
      appropriate to maintain and protect the rights and interests of Participants
      following such Restructuring Event. 

(b)     Any
      such
      action by the Board shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and all
      Participants. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall retain full
      authority to take, in its discretion, any of the foregoing actions with respect
      to Awards held by Participants who are directors, and the Board shall have
      no
      authority to act in any such matter. 

(c)     For
      purposes of this Section, "change of control" shall mean (i) the acquisition
      by
      any person of voting shares of the Company, not acquired directly from the
      Company, if, as a result of the acquisition, such person, or any "group" as
      defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 of which
      such
      person is a part, owns at least 20% of the outstanding voting shares of the
      Company; or (ii) a change in the composition of the Board such that within
      any
      period of two consecutive years, persons who (a) at the beginning of such period
      constitute the Board or (b) become directors after the beginning of such period
      and whose election or nomination for election by the shareholders of the Company
      was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the persons who were either
      directors at the beginning of such period or whose subsequent election or
      nomination was previously approved in accordance with this clause (b), cease
      to
      constitute at least a majority of the Board; or (iii) a merger, consolidation,
      reorganization, or similar restructuring involving the Company is consummated
      and, as a result, the shareholders of the Company immediately prior to such
      event own less than 50% of the voting shares of the surviving entity outstanding
      immediately after such event. 

12.       Unfunded
      Plan   .
      Insofar
      as it provides for Awards of cash and Common Stock, the Plan shall be unfunded.
      Although bookkeeping accounts may be established with respect to Participants
      who are entitled to cash, Common Stock, or rights thereto under the Plan, any
      such accounts shall be used merely as a bookkeeping convenience. The Company
      shall not be required to segregate any assets that may at any time be
      represented by cash, Common Stock, or rights thereto, nor shall the Plan be
      construed as providing for such segregation, nor shall the Company or the Board
      or the Committee be deemed to be a trustee of any cash, Common Stock, or rights
      thereto to be granted under the Plan. Any liability of the Company or any of
      its
      affiliates to any Participant with respect to a grant of cash, Common Stock,
      or
      rights thereto under the Plan shall be based solely upon any contractual
      obligations that may be created by the Plan and any Award Agreement; no such
      obligation of the Company or any of its affiliates shall be deemed to be secured
      by any pledge or other encumbrance on any property of the Company. Neither
      the
      Company nor the Board nor the Committee shall be required to give any security
      or bond for the performance of any obligation that may be created by the
      Plan. 

13.       Right
      of Discharge Reserved   .
      Nothing
      in the Plan or in any Award shall confer upon any employee or other individual
      the right to continue in the employment or service of the Company or any
      affiliate of the Company or affect any right the Company or any affiliate of
      the
      Company may have to terminate the employment or service of any such employee
      or
      other individual at any time for any reason. 

14.       Nature
      of Payments   .
      All
      Awards made pursuant to the Plan are in consideration of services performed

                fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
                to
                materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
                reporting.

                process, summarize and report financial information;
                and
