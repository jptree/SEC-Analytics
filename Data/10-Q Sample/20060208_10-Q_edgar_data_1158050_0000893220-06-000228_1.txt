AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Unaudited) 

(1)  BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Airgas, Inc. and its
subsidiaries (the  Company ), as well as the Company s consolidated affiliate, National Welders.
Intercompany accounts and transactions, including those between the Company and National Welders,
are eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These statements do not include all disclosures required for annual financial
statements. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the more complete
disclosures contained in the Company s audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2005.

The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates. The consolidated
financial statements reflect, in the opinion of management, reasonable estimates and all
adjustments necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position, results of operations
and cash flows for the periods presented. The interim operating results are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for an entire year.

Certain reclassifications pertaining to a divested subsidiary and the presentation of cash
balances have been made to prior period financial statements to conform to the current
presentation. As described in Note 3, the Company divested its
subsidiary, Rutland Tool   Supply
Co. ( Rutland Tool ), in December 2005. As a result, Rutland Tool has been reclassified in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings as discontinued operations in all periods presented. The
Consolidated Balance Sheet was not reclassified because the assets and liabilities of Rutland Tool were not significant. In addition, the
presentation of depository cash and cash overdrafts has changed from a net cash presentation on the
balance sheet to a gross presentation. Previously, the Company did not show cash balances as all
depository cash and cash overdrafts were combined and the net overdraft was recorded in other
current liabilities. Accordingly, the Statement of Cash Flows for the prior period presented also
reflects the change in presentation and reconciles to the change in cash on the balance sheet. The
Company adopted the current presentation as it is the practice among most companies and is more
transparent.

(2)  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (the  AJCA ) was signed into law. In
December 2004, responding to the AJCA, the FASB issued Staff Position 109-1,  Tax Deduction on
Qualified Production Activities Provided by the AJCA,  ( FSP 109-1 ) and FASB Staff Position 109-2,
 Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision with in the
AJCA,  ( FSP 109-2 ). FSP 109-1 clarifies that the manufacturer s deduction provided for under the
AJCA should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with SFAS 109,  Accounting for
Income  Taxes, and not as a tax rate reduction. FSP 109-1 was effective for the Company as of
April 1, 2005 and had no impact on the current fiscal year. In addition, the Company evaluated
the effects of the repatriation provision included in FSP 109-2 and concluded that it will not
repatriate foreign earnings under the AJCA.

(3)  ACQUISITIONS   DIVESTITURE 

(a) Acquisitions 

During the nine months ended December 31, 2005, the Company completed five acquisitions with
combined annual sales of approximately $100 million. The aggregate purchase price paid for the
five acquisitions and various holdback settlements was approximately $99 million. Costs in excess of net assets acquired
( goodwill ) related to the acquisitions totaled approximately $31 million. The largest of these
acquisitions was the June 1, 2005 purchase of the Industrial Products Division of LaRoche
Industries ( LaRoche ). LaRoche is a leading distributor of anhydrous ammonia in the U.S. with
annual sales of approximately $65 million. The LaRoche operations were incorporated into a new
business unit,  Airgas Specialty Products,  that has been added to the All Other Operations
business segment. The Company believes the bulk ammonia customers served by LaRoche represent a
cross selling opportunity for the Company s complimentary product lines. Also on June 1, 2005, the
Company completed the acquisition of Kanox, Inc. ( Kanox ), a Kansas-based distributor of packaged
gases and related hardgoods products with annual sales of approximately $23 million. Kanox
represents an opportunity to improve geographic coverage in the mid-Western region of the U.S. The
Kanox business has been added to the Distribution business segment.

(b) BOC Contingent Consideration 

In November 2005, the Company paid The BOC Group, Inc. ( BOC ) $20 million in contingent
consideration related to the July 2004 purchase of BOC s U.S. packaged gas business. The
contingent consideration was determined based on the Company achieving certain financial targets
that were set forth in the asset purchase agreement as well as other factors associated with the
transaction.

(c) Divestiture 

On December 1, 2005, the Company completed the previously announced sale of its subsidiary,
Rutland Tool   Supply Co (Rutland Tool). Rutland Tool distributed metalworking tools, machine
tools and MRO supplies from seven locations and had approximately 180 employees. Proceeds of the
sale were approximately $15 millions, with subsequent consideration of up to $5.6 million for trade
receivables to be paid as they are collected. As a result of the divestiture, the Company
reflected the operating results of Rutland Tool as  discontinued operations  and recognized a loss
of approximately $3.1 million, $1.9 million after-tax, or $0.02 per diluted share, on the sale.
The loss principally relates to the write-off of leasehold improvements and lease termination
costs for long-term lease commitments that are not being assumed by
the purchaser. No portion of consolidated interest expense was
allocated to the discontinued operations. The operating
results of Rutland Tool were previously reflected in the Distribution business segment.

The net sales and earnings (loss) before income taxes of Rutland Tool (including the loss on
sale) for the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, which were segregated
and reported as discontinued operations, are outlined below:

(3)
 ACQUISITIONS   DIVESTITURE    (Continued)

At December 31, and March 31, 2005, the Company s consolidated financial statements include
the assets and liabilities of Rutland Tool as outlined below. The net assets and liabilities of
Rutland Tool were not presented as discontinued operations on the balance sheet because the amounts
were not significant.

(4)  EARNINGS PER SHARE 

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net earnings by the weighted average
number of shares of the Company s common stock outstanding during the period. Outstanding shares
consist of issued shares less treasury stock and common stock held by the Employee Benefits Trust.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net earnings by the weighted average common
shares outstanding adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents related to stock
options and warrants. The calculation of diluted earnings per share also assumes the conversion
of National Welders  preferred stock to Airgas common stock.

The table below presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the
three and nine months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(4)
 EARNINGS PER SHARE    (Continued)

(1) 
       
     Pursuant to a joint venture agreement between the Company and the holders of the
preferred stock of National Welders, between June 2005 and June 2009, the preferred
shareholders have the option to exchange their 3.2 million preferred shares of National
Welders either for cash at a price of $17.78 per share or to tender them to the joint
venture in exchange for approximately 2.3 million shares of Airgas common stock. If
Airgas common stock has a market value of $24.45 per share, the stock and cash redemption
options are equivalent. 

(2) 
       
     If the preferred stockholders of National Welders convert their preferred stock to
Airgas common stock, the 5% preferred stock dividend, recognized as  Minority interest in
earnings of consolidated affiliate,  would no longer be paid to the preferred
stockholders, resulting in additional net earnings for Airgas. 

(3) 
       
     The earnings of National Welders for tax purposes are treated as a deemed dividend to
Airgas, net of an 80% dividend exclusion. Upon the assumed conversion of National Welders
preferred stock to Airgas common stock, National Welders would become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Airgas. As a wholly owned subsidiary, the net earnings of National Welders
would not be subject to additional tax at the Airgas level. 

(4) 
       
     The assumed conversion of National Welders preferred stock to Airgas common stock is
not presented because it was anti-dilutive. 

Outstanding stock options with an exercise price above market are excluded from the
Company s diluted computation as their effect would be anti-dilutive. For the three months ended
December 31, 2005, there were approximately 3 thousand outstanding stock options with an exercise
price above the average market price. For the three months ended December 31, 2004, there were no
options with an exercise price above the average market price. For the nine months ended December
31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, there were 60 thousand and 2 thousand outstanding stock options
with an exercise price above the average market price, respectively. If the average market value
of the Company s common stock increases above the respective exercise prices of the options, they
will be included in the diluted computation as common stock equivalents.

(5)  TRADE RECEIVABLES SECURITIZATION 

The Company participates in a securitization agreement with two commercial banks to sell up to
$225 million of qualifying trade receivables. The agreement will expire in February 2008, but may
be renewed subject to renewal provisions contained in the agreement. During the nine months ended
December 31, 2005, the Company sold, net of its retained interest, $1,748 million of trade
receivables and remitted to bank conduits, pursuant to a servicing agreement, $1,714 million in
collections on those receivables. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was
$224 million at December 31, 2005 and $190 million at March 31, 2005.

The transaction has been accounted for as a sale under the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 140,  Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities . Under the securitization agreement, eligible trade receivables
are sold to bank conduits through a bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity, which is consolidated
for financial reporting purposes. The difference between the proceeds from the sale and the
carrying value of the receivables is recognized as  Discount on securitization of trade
receivables  in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings and varies on a monthly basis
depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates. The Company retains a subordinated
interest in the receivables sold, which is recorded at the receivables  previous carrying value.
Subordinated retained interests of approximately $70 million and $57 million are included in  Trade
receivables  in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2005 and March 31,
2005, respectively. The Company s retained interest is generally collected within 60 days. On a
monthly basis, management measures the fair value of the retained interest at management s best
estimate of the undiscounted expected future cash collections on the transferred receivables.
Changes in the fair value are recognized as bad debt expense. Actual cash collections may differ
from these estimates and would directly affect the fair value of the retained interest. In
accordance with a servicing agreement, the Company continues to service, administer and collect the
trade receivables on behalf of the bank conduits. The servicing fees charged to the bank conduits
approximate the costs of collections.

(6)  INVENTORIES, NET 

Inventories, net, consist of:

Net inventories determined by the LIFO inventory method totaled $34 million and $32 million at
December 31, 2005 and March 31, 2005, respectively. If the FIFO inventory method had been used for
these inventories, the carrying value would have been approximately $6 million and $5 million
higher at December 31, 2005 and March 31, 2005, respectively. Substantially all of the inventories
are finished goods.

(7)  ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES 

Accrued expenses and other current liabilities include:

(8)  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 

The Company manages its exposure to changes in market interest rates. The Company s
involvement with derivative instruments is limited to highly effective fixed interest rate swap
agreements used to manage well-defined interest rate risk exposures. The Company monitors its
positions and credit ratings of its counterparties and does not anticipate non-performance by the
counterparties. Interest rate swap agreements are not entered into for trading purposes.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had two fixed interest rate swap agreements with a notional
amount of $50 million that effectively convert a corresponding amount of variable interest rate
debt associated with the Company s credit facilities to fixed rate debt. The swap agreements
require the Company to make fixed interest payments based on an average effective rate of 4.15% and
receive variable interest payments from its counterparties based on one-month LIBOR, which was
4.36% at December 31, 2005. The remaining terms of each of these swap agreements is 3.4 years.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2005, the Company and National Welders recorded a net
increase in the fair value of the fixed interest rate swap agreements and a corresponding increase
to  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income  of approximately $1 million.

In June 2005, in conjunction with the repayment of a term loan (see Note 10), National Welders
terminated its fixed interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $21 million. The cost
to terminate the interest rate swap of $700 thousand was reimbursed to National Welders by its
preferred stockholders.

Including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements and the trade receivables
securitization, the Company s ratio of fixed to variable interest rates was approximately 53% fixed
to 47% variable at December 31, 2005.

(9)  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 

The valuations of goodwill and other intangible assets of recent acquisitions are based on
preliminary estimates of fair value and are subject to revision as the Company finalizes appraisals
and other analyses. Changes in the net carrying amount of goodwill for the nine months ended
December 31, 2005 were as follows:

Other intangible assets amounted to $18.8 million and $16.5 million (net of accumulated
amortization of $42.6 million and $38.7 million) at December 31, 2005 and March 31, 2005,
respectively. These intangible assets primarily consist of acquired customer lists amortized over
7 to 11 years and non-compete agreements entered into in connection with business combinations
amortized over the term of the agreements, principally five years. There are no expected residual
values related to these intangible assets. Intangible assets also include a trade name with an
indefinite useful life valued at $1 million acquired in the BOC acquisition. Estimated remaining
fiscal year amortization expense in millions is as follows: remainder of 2006   $1.3 million; 2007
  $4.2 million; 2008   $3.4 million; 2009   $2.3 million; 2010   $1.7 million, and $4.9 million
thereafter.

SFAS 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , requires the Company to perform an assessment
at least annually of the carrying value of goodwill associated with each of its reporting units.
The Company has elected to perform its annual assessment as of October 31 of each year. As of
October 31, 2005, the Company determined the implied fair value of each of its reporting units
using a discounted cash flow analysis and compared such values to the carrying value of each of the
respective reporting units. This annual assessment of goodwill indicated that the Company s
carrying value of goodwill was not impaired.

(10)  MINORITY INTEREST NOTE PREPAYMENT 

On June 6, 2005, National Welders entered into an agreement with its preferred stockholders
under which the preferred stockholders prepaid their $21 million note receivable owed to National
Welders. National Welders used the proceeds from the prepayment of the preferred stockholders 
note to repay its $21 million Term Loan B, which had been collateralized by the preferred
stockholders  note. The preferred stockholders note payable to National Welders had been reflected
as a reduction of  Minority interest in affiliate  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Consequently, the prepayment of the preferred stockholders  note resulted in a $21 million increase
to the Company s  Minority interest in affiliate.  Additionally, Term Loan B was subject to an
interest rate swap agreement, which was terminated in conjunction with the debt repayment. The fee
of $700 thousand to unwind the interest rate swap agreement was reimbursed to National Welders by
the preferred stockholders.

In addition, the Company and National Welders agreed to modify the dates between which the
preferred stockholders have the option to redeem their preferred stock for cash or Airgas common
stock to commence on June 6, 2005 and expire on June 30, 2009. Prior to the modification, pursuant
to a joint venture agreement between the Company and the holders of the preferred stock of National
Welders, the option period was to commence on July 1, 2006 and expire on September 30, 2009.

(11)  STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY 

Changes in stockholders  equity were as follows:

(a) 
       
     Issuance of common stock for purchases through the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and employee
stock options exercises. 

(b) 
       
     Reissuance of common stock from Treasury Stock and the Employee Benefits Trust for employee
stock option exercises. 

(c) 
       
     In November 2005, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a stock
repurchase plan. The stock repurchase plan authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $150
million of its common stock over a three-year period.

(12)  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 

The Company has elected to continue to account for its stock-based compensation plans in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees , as permitted by SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,  as amended. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for its stock option and
employee stock purchase plans. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and
earnings per share for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 as if the Company
had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to stock-based compensation. The
fair value of each option grant is estimated as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model.

(13)  COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND UNCERTAINTIES 

Litigation 

The Company is involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings that have arisen in the
ordinary course of its business and have not been fully adjudicated. These actions, when
ultimately concluded and determined, will not, in the opinion of management, have a material
adverse effect upon the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.

Losses from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita 

In August 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit the Gulf Coast area resulting in significant
and wide-spread damage. Of the Company s 29 locations along the gulf coast, two small branches
were destroyed and about half of the remaining branches sustained varying degrees of damage or
business interruption. As a result of these hurricanes, the Company recorded a $2.5 million loss
in Selling, Distribution and Administrative expenses through December 31, 2005. The loss reflects
the Company s insurance deductible for insured property losses, as well as estimated losses for
uninsured property at customer locations and an additional provision for credit losses primarily
related to smaller customers in the hardest hit areas.

      SUPPLEMENTARY CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS  

The obligations of the Company under its senior subordinated notes ( the Notes ) are
guaranteed by the Company s domestic subsidiaries (the  Guarantors ). The guarantees are made
fully and unconditionally on a joint and several basis. The Company s consolidated affiliate,
foreign holdings and bankruptcy remote special purpose entity (the  Non-guarantors ) are not
guarantors of the Notes. The claims of the creditors of the Non-guarantors have priority over the
rights of the Company to receive dividends or distributions from the Non-guarantors.

Presented below is supplementary condensed consolidating financial information for the
Company, the Guarantors and the Non-guarantors as of December 31, 2005 and March 31, 2005 and for
the nine month periods ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. As disclosed in Note (1)  Basis of
Presentation  and Note (3 ) Acquisitions and Divestiture , the Company sold its subsidiary Rutland
Tool in December 2005. Accordingly, the operating results of Rutland Tool, which was a guarantor
of the Company s senior subordinated notes, have been reclassified in the Consolidating Statements
of Earnings as discontinued operations for the nine month periods ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Certain other reclassifications of prior period amounts, including the gross
presentation of cash in depository accounts and cash overdrafts on disbursement accounts and
certain intercompany charges, have also been made to conform to the current year presentation.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

OVERVIEW  

Airgas, Inc. (the  Company ) had net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2005
( current quarter ) of $702 million compared to $601 million for the quarter ended December
31, 2004 ( prior year quarter ). Net sales increased by 17% driven by strong same-store
sales growth and the impact of acquisitions. Same-store sales growth contributed 12% to the
increase in total sales. Same-store sales growth was driven equally by pricing initiatives
and higher sales volumes. Price increases were initiated in response to rising product, operating and
distribution costs as well as other factors. Higher sales volumes resulted from the
continued strength of the industrial economy and the associated customer demand for the
Company s products. Same-store sales growth of hardgoods and gas and rent was 12%, with a
majority of the Company s business units reporting double-digit growth. Sales growth in the
Gulf Coast and Southwestern portions of the U.S. was particularly strong reflecting
post-hurricane demand for equipment, safety products and welding machines. Sales growth was
also driven by sales of strategic products. Strategic products were identified by the
Company as those expected to grow at a faster rate than the overall economy and include
safety products, medical, specialty, and bulk gases, as well as carbon dioxide products, such
as dry ice. Accordingly, the Company has initiatives focused on promoting these products.
Acquisitions continue to be an important component of the Company s growth contributing 5% to
the overall increase in net sales. The operating income margin expanded 130 basis points in
the current quarter to 9.8% compared to 8.5% in the prior year quarter reflecting improving
cost leverage. Solid sales growth and operating expense discipline resulted in a 37%
increase in earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the current quarter
versus the prior year quarter.

On December 1, 2005, the Company divested its subsidiary, Rutland Tool   Supply Co.,
Inc. ( Rutland Tool ). Rutland Tool distributed metalworking tools, machine tools and MRO
supplies from seven locations and had approximately 180 employees. Proceeds of the sale were
approximately $15 million at closing, with subsequent consideration of up to $5.6 million for
trade receivables to be paid as they are collected. As a result of the divestiture, the
Company reflected the operating results of Rutland Tool as  discontinued operations  and
recognized an after-tax loss on the sale of $1.9 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, in the
current quarter. All periods included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q have been
restated to present Rutland Tool as discontinued operations. Rutland Tool generated annual
sales of approximately $50 million and an insignificant amount of operating income. The
operating results of Rutland Tool were previously reflected in the Distribution business
segment.

Net earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 were $31 million, or $0.39 per
diluted share, compared to $23 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, in the prior year
quarter.

Through the nine months ended December 31, 2005, the Company completed five acquisitions
with combined annual sales of approximately $100 million. The aggregate purchase price paid
for the five acquisitions and various holdback settlements was approximately $99 million. The largest of these acquisitions
included the June 1, 2005 purchases of the Industrial Products Division of LaRoche Industries
( LaRoche ) and Kanox, Inc. ( Kanox ). LaRoche is a leading distributor of anhydrous ammonia
in the U.S. with annual sales of approximately $65 million. The LaRoche operations were
incorporated into a new business unit,  Airgas Specialty Products,  that has been added to
the All Other Operations business segment. Kanox is a Kansas-based distributor of packaged
gases and related hardgoods products with annual sales of approximately $23 million. Kanox
has been added to the Distribution segment. The Company continues to look for additional
acquisition opportunities to strengthen and expand its business.

AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

In November 2005, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a stock
repurchase plan. The stock repurchase plan authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $150
million of it common stock over a three year period. During the
quarter ended December 31, 2005, the Company repurchased 174 thousand shares for cash of $5.6
million.

Looking forward, the Company expects net earnings to range from $0.41 to $0.43 per
diluted share in its fiscal fourth quarter ending March 31, 2006. Based on the Company s
strong financial results through the fiscal third quarter, the Company anticipates earnings
from continuing operations of $1.57 to $1.59 per diluted share for the full 2006 fiscal year.
The forward-looking earnings guidance anticipates continued same-store sales growth and
successful pricing actions to offset rising product and energy costs.

STATEMENT OF EARNINGS COMMENTARY 

Net Sales 

Net sales increased 17% in the quarter ended December 31, 2005 compared to the quarter
ended December 31, 2004 reflecting same-store sales growth and acquisitions. Sales momentum
continued in the current quarter driven by the expanding industrial economy, strategic sales
initiatives and pricing actions. On a same-store basis, sales increased 12% versus the prior
year quarter with price and volume contributing equally to growth. In November 2005, the
Company announced that it would raise prices on its products to offset the impact of rising
product and delivery costs. Since the pricing actions were implemented towards the end of
the quarter, a significant portion of the pricing actions will be realized throughout the
fiscal fourth quarter. The Company intends to maintain its pricing discipline and keep pace
with rising costs.

The Company estimates same-store sales based on a comparison of current period sales to
prior period sales, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. The pro-forma adjustments
consist of adding acquired sales to, or subtracting sales of divested operations from, sales
reported in the prior period. These pro-forma adjustments used in calculating the same-store
sales metric are not reflected in the table below. The intercompany eliminations represent
sales from the All Other Operations segment to the Distribution segment.

The
Distribution segment s principal products and services
include: industrial, medical
and specialty gases; process chemicals; equipment rental and hardgoods. Industrial, medical
and specialty gases and process chemicals are distributed in cylinders and bulk containers.
Equipment rental fees are generally charged on cylinders, cryogenic liquid containers, bulk
and micro-bulk tanks, tube trailers and welding equipment. Hardgoods consist of welding
supplies and equipment, safety products, and supplies.

Distribution segment sales increased 14% during the current quarter compared to the
prior year quarter driven by same-store sales growth of $62 million (12%) and incremental
sales contributed by acquisitions of $11 million. Acquisitions primarily consisted of the
June 2005 acquisition of Kanox. The increase in Distribution same-store sales resulted from
higher hardgoods sales of $31 million (13%) and gas and rent sales growth of $31 million
(11%). Hardgoods same-store sales growth was driven by volume gains reflecting continued
strength of the industrial economy. Price increases of selected hardgoods products also
contributed to same-store sales growth. Radnor      private label products grew
23% on a same-store basis in the current quarter driven by higher volumes and pricing.
Same-store sales of safety products grew 19% in the current quarter benefiting from the
strong industrial economy as well as clean-up and recovery efforts in the Gulf Coast region.
Although solid hardgoods same-store sales growth continued in the current quarter, the
Company expects the same-store sales percentage growth rate of hardgoods to moderate over the
next few quarters as the current economic cycle matures.

AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The Distribution segment s gas and rent same-store sales increased 11% reflecting price
increases and to a lesser degree volume growth. The impact of pricing in the current quarter
primarily relates to actions initiated last spring. Also contributing to the sales growth
was a 36% increase in welding equipment rentals. The rebuilding effort in the Gulf Coast
area as well as the strengthening commercial construction market contributed to the increase
in demand for welding machines.

Sales of strategic products in the Distribution segment delivered combined same-store
sales growth of 14% in the current quarter. Sales growth of medical gases and related
cylinder rent grew 10% in the current quarter reflecting volume gains in the hospital sector
as well as continued success of the Company s Walk-O 2 -Bout  portable oxygen
cylinders. Sales of gases in bulk containers and specialty gases were also strong
contributors to the growth in strategic product sales in the current quarter.

The All Other Operations segment consists of producers and distributors of gas products,
principally of dry ice, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, specialty gases, and process
chemicals, including ammonia. The segment also includes the Company s National Welders joint
venture. All Other Operations  sales, net of intercompany eliminations, increased $29
million (35%) compared to the prior year quarter resulting from same-store sales growth and
acquisitions. Same-store sales growth of 16% was driven by continued sales momentum of
National Welders and pricing actions taken by Airgas Specialty Products. Airgas Specialty
Products is a leading distributor of anhydrous ammonia that was formed when LaRoche was
acquired in June 2005. Sales of dry ice and liquid carbon dioxide also had higher sales in
the current quarter.

Gross Profits 

Gross profits do not reflect depreciation expense and distribution costs. The Company
reflects distribution costs as elements of Selling, Distribution and Administrative Expenses
and recognizes depreciation on all its property, plant and equipment on the income statement
line item  Depreciation.  Since some companies may report certain or all of these costs as
elements of their Cost of Products Sold, the Company s gross profits discussed below may not
be comparable to those of other entities.

Gross profits increased 15% resulting principally from higher sales volumes and
acquisitions. However, the growth in the Distribution segment s hardgoods sales continued to
out-pace the growth in higher margin gas sales resulting in a shift in sales mix. The shift
in sales mix in the Distribution segment and the acquisition and subsequent growth of the
lower margin anhydrous ammonia product line are principally responsible for the 100 basis
point decrease in gross profit margins to 50.8% in the current quarter compared to 51.8% in
the prior year quarter.

The Distribution segment s gross profits increased $33 million (13%) compared to the
prior year quarter. The Distribution segment s gross profit margin of 49.3% decreased 50
basis points from 49.8% in the prior year quarter, which is principally attributable to the
shift in sales mix from higher margin gas and rent sales to hardgoods. The mix of gas and
rent as a percentage of total sales was 52.6% as compared to 53.1% in the prior year quarter.
The shift in sales mix between gas and rent and hardgoods resulted from the 13% same-store
sales growth in hardgoods during the quarter versus 11% same-store sales growth for gas and
rent. Excluding the impact of sales mix, the
underlying gross profit margin of gas and rent increased modestly reflecting the Company s
success at passing on the cost increases to customers. Product, energy and certain operating
expenses

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

are expected to remain high and may increase in future periods. The pricing
initiatives announced by the Company in November 2005 reflect this rising cost
environment.

The All Other Operations segment s gross profits increased $13 million (24%) primarily
from the addition of the anhydrous ammonia business acquired from LaRoche and strong sales at
National Welders. The anhydrous ammonia business carries a lower gross margin than National
Welders and the carbon dioxide businesses that are also reported in this segment. The
addition of LaRoche is the principal factor contributing to the 280 basis point decline in
the gross profit margin from 55.0% in the prior year quarter to 52.2% in the current quarter.

Operating Expenses 

Selling, distribution and administrative expenses ( SD A ) consist of labor and overhead
associated with the purchasing, marketing and distribution of the Company s products, as well
as costs associated with a variety of administrative functions such as legal, treasury,
accounting, tax and facility-related expenses. As a percentage of net sales, SD A expense
decreased 230 basis points to 36.4% compared to 38.7% in the prior year quarter reflecting
improved cost leverage. SD A expenses increased $23 million (10%) primarily from operating
costs of acquired businesses and higher variable expenses associated with the growth in sales
volumes. As compared with the prior year quarter, acquisitions (principally the LaRoche and
Kanox acquisitions) contributed an estimated additional $9 million to SD A expense. The SD A
expense contributed by the current year acquisitions reflects acquisition integration costs
that were $1 million lower in the current year quarter than they were in the prior year
quarter. The prior year quarter reflects costs associated with integrating the prior year
acquisition of the U.S. packaged gas business of The BOC Group, Inc. The balance of the
increase is primarily attributable to higher labor costs and distribution-related expenses.
The increase in labor costs reflected costs to fill cylinders and operate facilities to meet
increased demand for products as well as normal wage inflation. The increase in distribution
expenses is attributable to higher fuel costs, which are up approximately $3 million versus
the prior year quarter. Higher fuel costs were directly related to the rise in diesel fuel
prices over the past year and the increase in miles driven to source gas products and meet
customer demand.

Depreciation expense of $31 million increased $4 million (16%) compared to the prior
year quarter. Acquired businesses contributed depreciation expense of approximately $1
million. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects the current and prior year s
capital investments in revenue generating assets, including cylinders, bulk tanks and rental
welders, as well as expansions of certain plants and branch stores. Amortization expense of
approximately $1 million was consistent with the prior year quarter.

Operating Income 

Operating income increased 35% in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter
driven by higher sales levels. Improved cost leverage was the primary contributor to a 130
basis point increase in the operating income margin to 9.8% compared to 8.5% in the prior year
quarter.

Operating income in the Distribution segment increased 32% in the current quarter. The
Distribution segment s
operating income margin increased 120 basis points to 9.0% compared to 7.8% in the prior year
quarter. The increase in the operating income margin reflects the lower operating expenses as
a percentage of net sales, described above. The operating income margin also reflects the
improvement of the acquired BOC business as it was

28

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

rationalized and integrated into the
Company s operations.

Operating income in the All Other Operations segment increased 49% resulting primarily
from the strong business momentum of National Welders as well as the anhydrous ammonia
business from LaRoche. Higher sales of dry ice and liquid carbon dioxide also contributed to
the growth in operating income. The segment s operating income margin was 12.7% in the
current quarter versus 11.2% in the prior year quarter.

Interest Expense and Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables 

The Company participates in a securitization agreement with two commercial banks to sell
up to $225 million of qualifying trade receivables. The amount of outstanding receivables
under the agreement was $224 million at December 31, 2005, an increase of $34 million from
March 31, 2005. Net proceeds from the sale of trade receivables were used to reduce
borrowings under the Company s revolving credit facilities. The discount on the
securitization of trade receivables represents the difference between the carrying value of
the receivables and the proceeds from their sale. The amount of the discount varies on a
monthly basis depending on the amount of receivables sold and market rates.

Interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables of $16
million increased 8% compared to the prior year quarter. The increase primarily resulted
from higher debt levels associated with acquisitions and capital expenditures and rising
interest rates.

As discussed in  Liquidity and Capital Resources  and in Item 3,  Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,  the Company manages its exposure to interest rate
risk of certain borrowings through participation in interest rate swap agreements. Including
the effect of the interest rate swap agreements and the trade receivables securitization, the
Company s ratio of fixed to variable interest rates was approximately 53% fixed to 47%
variable at December 31, 2005. A majority of the Company s variable rate debt is based on a
spread over the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ). Based on the Company s fixed to
variable interest rate ratio at December 31, 2005, for every 25 basis point increase in
LIBOR, the Company estimates that its annual interest expense would increase approximately $1
million.

Income Tax Expense 

The effective income tax rate was 37.2% of pre-tax earnings in current quarter compared
to 36% in the prior year quarter.

Income from Continuing Operations 

Income from continuing operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 was $33
million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared to $23 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, in
the prior year quarter.

Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations 

In the quarter ended December 31, 2005, the Company recognized a loss from discontinued
operations of $3.1 million, $1.9 million after tax, or $0.02 per diluted share, related to
the divestiture of Rutland Tool. The loss principally related to the write-off of leasehold
improvements and lease termination costs for long-term lease commitments that are not being
assumed by the purchaser.

Net Earnings 

Net earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 were $31 million, or $0.39 per
diluted share, compared to $23 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, in the prior year
quarter.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 2004

STATEMENT OF EARNINGS COMMENTARY 

Net Sales 

Net sales increased 21% in the nine months ended December 31, 2005 ( current period )
compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2004 ( prior year period ) reflecting
same-store sales growth and acquisitions. Sales growth resulted from the strong industrial
economy and price increases levied to offset rising product and distribution costs. On a
same-store basis, sales increased 11% versus the prior year period with sales growth split
fairly evenly between volume and price gains.

Distribution segment sales increased 19% during the current period compared to the prior
year period driven by same-store sales growth of $181 million (12%) and sales contributed by
acquisitions of $105 million. Incremental sales from acquisitions primarily consisted of the
impact of the July 2004 BOC acquisition and the June 2005 Kanox acquisition. The increase in
Distribution same-store sales resulted from higher hardgoods sales of $96 million (13%) and
gas and rent sales growth of $85 million (10%). In the current period, strong volume gains
in sales of safety and Radnor private label products helped drive the growth in hardgoods
same-store sales. Same-store sales of safety products grew 17% in the current period
benefiting from the strong industrial economy and reconstruction efforts along the Gulf
Coast, as well as the Company s multi-channel sales approach and focus on account
penetration. Radnor products grew 29% reflecting the rollout of new products and expansion
of the Company s branch-store core stocking program to acquired locations. Same-store sales
of hardgoods also benefited from pricing actions taken during the current period to offset
rising product costs.

The Distribution segment s same-store sales growth for gas and rent of 10% was driven by
price increases and volume growth. Broad pricing actions were initiated in March 2005 in
response to rising product and delivery costs and other operating expenses. Additional
pricing actions were announced in late November 2005; however, most of the impact of those
price increases will be reflected in the fourth quarter. Sales growth was achieved across
nearly all major product lines, including the largest product line, industrial gases (e.g.,
nitrogen, oxygen, argon, acetylene, etc.). Sales of strategic products also helped drive the
growth in gas and rent same-store sales. During the current period, strategic products
delivered solid growth, particularly related to sales of bulk, medical, and specialty gases.
Sales of medical, specialty and bulk gases generated combined same-store sales growth of 11%.
Same-store sales growth was also helped by a 25% increase in welding equipment rentals.

All Other Operations  sales, net of intercompany eliminations, increased $74 million
compared to the prior year period. The acquisition of the anhydrous ammonia business from
LaRoche and the subsequent formation of Airgas
Specialty Products in June 2005 contributed sales of $48 million in the current period.
Same-store sales growth was primarily attributable to National Welders and pricing actions
taken by Airgas Specialty Products. Sales of liquid carbon dioxide and dry ice also
increased modestly reflecting competitive market pressures.

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Gross Profits 

Gross profits do not reflect depreciation expense and distribution costs. The Company
reflects distribution costs as elements of Selling, Distribution and Administrative Expenses
and recognizes depreciation on all its property, plant and equipment on the income statement
line item  Depreciation.  Since some companies may report certain or all of these costs as
elements of their Cost of Products Sold, the Company s gross profits discussed below may not
be comparable to those of other entities.

Gross profits increased 19% resulting from higher sales volumes, acquisitions and price
increases. The gross profit margin decreased 90 basis points to 50.6% in the current period
compared to 51.5% in the prior year period. The decrease in the gross profit margin reflects
the acquisition and subsequent growth of the lower margin anhydrous ammonia product line and
a shift in sales product mix.

The Distribution segment s gross profits increased $135 million (19%) compared to the
prior year period. Distribution s gross profit margin of 49.1% decreased 40 basis points
from 49.5% in the prior year period. The lower gross profit margin reflects a shift in gas sales
mix. Pricing actions taken by the Company
in the current period helped to mitigate the impact of rising product costs.

The All Other Operations segment s gross profits increased $31 million primarily from
strong sales at National Welders and the addition of the anhydrous ammonia business in the
current period. Although the gross profit dollars for the segment increased, the gross
profit margin declined by 340 basis points to 51.8% from 55.2% in the prior year period. The
gross profit margin decline reflects the acquisition of the anhydrous ammonia product line,
which carries a lower margin than other products in this segment, and competitive pressures
in the market for dry ice.

Operating Expenses 

As a percentage of net sales, SD A expenses decreased 140 basis points to 36.7% compared
to 38.1% in the prior year period resulting from improved cost leverage. SD A expenses
increased $108 million (16%) primarily from operating costs of acquired businesses and higher
variable expenses associated with the growth in sales volumes. As compared with the prior
year period, acquisitions (principally the LaRoche and Kanox acquisitions) contributed an
estimated additional $53 million to SD A expense. The SD A expenses contributed by the
current year acquisitions reflect acquisition integration costs that were $3 million lower in
the current year period than they were in the prior year period. The prior year period
reflects costs associated with integrating the BOC acquisition. The balance of the increase
in SD A expenses is primarily attributable to higher labor costs, distribution-related
expenses and selling expenses. The increase in labor costs reflected costs to fill cylinders
and operate facilities to meet increased demand for products as well as normal wage
inflation. The increase in distribution expenses is attributable to higher fuel costs and
vehicle repair and maintenance expenses. Higher fuel costs were directly related to the rise
in diesel fuel prices over the past year and the increase in miles driven to support the
higher sales volumes. Selling expenses also reflect higher sales levels and an
additional provision for uncollectible trade receivables associated with customers affected
by hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

Depreciation expense of $90 million increased $14 million (18%) compared to $76 million
in the prior year
period. Acquisitions contributed depreciation expense of approximately $7 million. The
remainder of the

31

Table of Contents

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

increase primarily reflects the current and prior year s capital
expenditures to support growth, including purchases of cylinders, bulk tanks and rental
welders. Amortization expense of $4 million in the current period was consistent with the
prior year period.

Operating Income 

Operating income increased 30% in the current period compared to the prior year period
driven by higher sales levels. Cost leverage and the improved
operations of the BOC business acquired in the prior year
contributed to a 70 basis point increase in the operating income margin to 9.4% compared to
8.7% in the prior year period.

Operating income in the Distribution segment increased 30% in the current period. The
Distribution segment s operating income margin increased 70 basis points to 8.4% compared to
7.7% in the prior year period. The increase in the operating income margin reflects the
lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, described above. The prior year
period was negatively impacted by integration costs and initial lower margins of the business
acquired from BOC.

Operating income in the All Other Operations segment increased 30% resulting primarily
from the strong business momentum of National Welders as well as the acquisition of anhydrous
ammonia business from LaRoche. The segment s operating income margin increased 30 basis
points to 12.8% in the current period compared to 12.5% in the prior year period. The higher
operating income margin principally relates to lower operating expenses as a percentage of
net sales, partially offset by the lower operating margin of the anhydrous ammonia business.

Interest Expense and Discount on Securitization of Trade Receivables 

Interest expense, net, and the discount on securitization of trade receivables of $47
million increased 15% compared to the prior year period. The increase primarily resulted
from higher debt levels associated with acquisitions and capital expenditures and higher
interest rates.

Income Tax Expense 

The effective income tax rate was 37.5% of pre-tax earnings in the current period
compared to 37% in the prior year period.

Income from Continuing Operations 

Income from continuing operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2005 was $92
million, or $1.16 per diluted share, compared to $68 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, in
the prior year period.

Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations 

In the nine months ended December 31, 2005, the Company recognized a loss from
discontinued operations of $2.4 million, $1.4 million after tax, or $0.02 per diluted share,
related to the divestiture of Rutland Tool. The loss principally related to the write-off of
leasehold improvements and lease termination costs for long-term lease commitments that are
not being assumed by the purchaser.

Net Earnings 

Net earnings for the nine months ended December 31, 2005 were $90 million, or $1.14 per
diluted share, compared to $68 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, in the prior year period.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

Cash Flows 

Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $227 million for the nine months
ended December 31, 2005 compared to $116 million in the comparable prior year period. The
increase in operating cash flows primarily resulted from higher net earnings adjusted for
non-cash items. Net earnings adjusted for non-cash items provided cash of $229 million
versus $180 million in the prior year period. The Company also increased the level of
receivables sold under its trade receivables securitization program providing cash of $34
million in the current period versus $30 million in the prior year period. Improved
management of working capital resulted in a use of cash of $35 million in the current period
versus $94 million in the prior year period. The use of cash for working capital in the
current period principally reflects lower accounts payable related to the timing of payments
to vendors and higher levels of inventory and trade receivables in support of sales growth.
Cash flows of National Welders, in excess of a management fee paid by National Welders to the
Company, are not available to the Company. Cash provided by operating activities in the
current period included $16 million of cash provided by National Welders, which was
consistent with $13 million in the prior year period. Cash flows provided by operating
activities were used to fund investing activities, such as capital expenditures and
acquisitions.

Net cash used in investing activities totaled $234 million during the current period and
primarily consisted of cash used for capital expenditures and acquisitions. Capital
expenditures were $154 million in the current period (including $16 million at National
Welders) and primarily relate to spending for cylinders, bulk tanks and rental welding machines.
These capital expenditures reflect investments to support the Company s sales growth initiatives. Cash of
$99 million was paid in the current period for acquisitions and holdback payments primarily
related to the LaRoche, Kanox and BOC acquisitions.

Financing activities provided net cash of $16 million primarily from an increase in the
cash overdraft and a note prepayment by the preferred stockholders of National Welders,
partially offset by dividends paid to stockholders and debt repayment. An increase in the
Company s cash overdraft provided cash of $28 million in the current period. The cash
overdraft represents outstanding checks. As described below, cash of $21 million was
provided by National Welders  minority stockholders  note prepayment, the proceeds of which
were used to repay National Welders  Term Loan B.

In June 2005, National Welders entered into an agreement with its preferred stockholders
under which the preferred stockholders prepaid their $21 million note receivable to National
Welders. National Welders used the proceeds from the prepayment of the preferred
stockholders  note to pay-off its $21 million Term Loan B, which had been collateralized by
the preferred stockholders  note. In connection with the note prepayment, National Welders
terminated an interest rate swap agreement that converted the variable rate Term Loan B to a
fixed interest rate. The preferred stockholders reimbursed National Welders $700 thousand
for the fee to terminate the interest rate swap agreement. Also see Note 10 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Effective March 31, 2005, the Company changed from a net cash presentation on the
balance sheet to a gross presentation. Previously, the Company did not show cash balances as
all depository cash and cash overdrafts were combined and the net overdraft was recorded in
other current liabilities. In the current presentation, depository cash and cash overdrafts
are presented on a gross basis. The Company adopted the current presentation to be
consistent with the practice among most companies and to be more transparent. The Statement
of Cash Flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 reflects the reclassification to
conform to the current presentation.

Dividends 

At the end of each quarter during the nine months ended December 31, 2005, the Company
paid its stockholders regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.06 per share. On January 31,
2006, the Company s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.06
per share, which is payable on March 31, 2006 to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2006.
Future dividend declarations and associated amounts paid will depend upon the Company s
earnings, financial condition, loan covenants, capital requirements and other factors deemed
relevant by management and the Company s Board of Directors.

Stock Repurchase Plan 

In November 2005, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a stock
repurchase plan. The stock repurchase plan authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $150
million of it common stock over a three year period. During the quarter ended December 31,
2005, the Company repurchased 174 thousand shares for cash of $5.6 million.

Financial Instruments 

Senior Credit Agreement 

The Company has unsecured senior credit facilities with a syndicate of lenders under a
credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) that provides revolving credit lines of $308
million and Canadian $50 million and a term loan. The Credit Agreement has a maturity date
of January 14, 2010. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had revolving credit borrowings of
approximately $144 million, Canadian $25 million (U.S. $21 million), and term loan borrowings
of $85 million. As of December 31, 2005, the Company also had commitments under letters of
credit of $39 million, of which $5 million was supported by the Credit Agreement and $34
million was supported by an arrangement with another financial institution. The U.S. dollar
borrowings bear interest of LIBOR plus 95 basis points and the Canadian dollar borrowings
bear interest at the Canadian Bankers  Acceptance Rate plus 95 basis points. As of December
31, 2005, the effective interest rate on the U.S. dollar revolving credit lines, the Canadian
dollar credit lines and the U.S. dollar term loan were 5.25%, 4.30% and 5.48%, respectively.

Under the Credit Agreement, the Company s domestic subsidiaries guarantee the U.S.
borrowings and Canadian borrowings, and the Company s foreign subsidiaries also guarantee the
Canadian borrowings. The guarantees are full and unconditional and are made on a joint and
several basis. The Company has pledged 100% of the stock of its domestic subsidiaries and
65% of the stock of its foreign subsidiaries as surety for its obligations under the
agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for the release of the guarantees and collateral if
the Company attains an investment grade credit rating and maintains such rating for two
consecutive quarters.

Medium-Term Notes 

At December 31, 2005, the Company had $100 million of medium-term notes due September
2006 bearing interest at a fixed rate of 7.75%. The medium-term notes have been presented in
the current portion of long-term debt at December 31, 2005. It is the Company s intention to
refinance the notes upon maturity with borrowings under its senior credit agreement. The
medium-term notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by
each of the wholly owned domestic guarantors under the revolving credit facilities. The
Company has pledged the stock of its domestic guarantors for the benefit of the note holders.

Senior Subordinated Notes 

At December 31, 2005, the Company had $150 million of senior subordinated notes (the
 2004 Notes ) outstanding with a maturity date of July 15, 2014. The 2004 Notes bear
interest at a fixed annual rate of 6.25%, payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of
each year. The 2004 notes have an optional redemption provision, which permits the Company,
at its option, to call the 2004 Notes at scheduled dates and prices. The first scheduled
optional redemption date is July 15, 2009 at a price of 103.1% of the principal amount.

In addition to the 2004 Notes, at December 31, 2005, the Company had $225 million of
senior subordinated notes (the  2001 Notes ) outstanding with a maturity date of October 1,
2011. The 2001 Notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 9.125%, payable semi-annually
on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 2001 notes also have an optional redemption
provision, which permits the Company, at its option, to call the 2001 Notes at scheduled
dates and prices. The first scheduled optional redemption date is October 1, 2006 at a price
of 104.6% of the principal amount.

The 2004 Notes and 2001 Notes contain covenants that could restrict the payment of
dividends, the repurchase of common stock, the issuance of preferred stock, and the
incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens. The 2004 Notes and 2001 Notes are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally, on a subordinated basis, by each of the
wholly owned domestic guarantors under the revolving credit facilities. The stock of the
Company s domestic subsidiaries is also pledged to the note holders on a subordinated basis.

Acquisition and Other Notes 

The Company s long-term debt also included acquisition and other notes principally
consisting of notes issued to sellers of businesses acquired and are repayable in periodic
installments. At December 31, 2005, acquisition and other notes totaled approximately $7
million with interest rates ranging from 5% to 8.5%.

Total Borrowing Capacity 

Some of the Company s financial instruments (principally the Credit Agreement and the
Senior Subordinated Notes) contain covenants requiring the Company to maintain certain
leverage and coverage ratios. These covenants serve to limit the total amount of debt that
the Company may incur. As of December 31, 2005, the Company was able to incur $420 million
of additional debt: $180 million available under the Credit Agreement and $240 million that
the Company would need to arrange. Should the Company s financing requirements exceed
amounts available under the Credit Agreement, the Company believes that it could obtain
these funds on reasonable terms. The terms of any future financing arrangements depend on
market conditions and the Company s financial position at that time.

The Company continues to look for acquisition candidates. The Company s financial
instruments require that covenant calculations include the pro forma results of acquired
businesses. Therefore, borrowing capacity is not reduced dollar-for-dollar with acquisition
financing.

Financial Instruments of the National Welders Joint Venture 

Pursuant to the requirements of FASB s Financial Interpretation No. 46 (revised December
2003),  Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities , ( FIN 46R ), the Company s Consolidated
Balance Sheets at December 31, 2005 and March 31, 2005 include the financial obligations of
National Welders. National Welders  financial obligations are non-recourse to the Company,
meaning that the creditors of National Welders do not have a claim on the assets of Airgas,
Inc.

AIRGAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The National Welders Credit Agreement (the  NWS Credit Agreement)  provides for a Term
Loan A of $26 million, a Term Loan B of $21 million, a Term Loan C of $9 million, and a
revolving credit line of $44 million. Term Loan A is repayable in monthly amounts of $254
thousand with a lump-sum payment of the outstanding balance at maturity in June 2007. Term
Loan B was repaid in its entirety in June 2005 with the proceeds from the minority
stockholders  prepayment of its notes due to National Welders (See Note 10 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements). Term Loan C matures in September 2006 and the revolving
credit agreement matures in August 2008. The variable interest rate on Term Loan A and the
revolving credit line ranges from LIBOR plus 70 to 145 basis points based on National
Welders  leverage ratio. The NWS Credit Agreement contains certain covenants which, among
other things, limit the ability of National Welders to incur and guarantee new indebtedness,
subject National Welders to minimum net worth requirements, and limit its capital
expenditures, ownership changes, merger and acquisition activity, and the payment of
dividends.

At December 31, 2005, National Welders had borrowings under its revolving credit line of
$29 million, under Term Loan A of $16 million and under Term Loan C of $2 million. At
December 31, 2005, the effective interest rate for Term Loan A and the revolving credit line
was 5.34%. Term Loan C bears a fixed interest rate of 7%. Based on restrictions related to
certain leverage ratios, National Welders had additional borrowing capacity under the NWS
Credit Agreement of approximately $15 million at December 31, 2005.

As of December 31, 2005, Term Loan A and the revolving credit line are secured by
certain current assets, principally trade receivables and inventory, totaling $29 million,
non-current assets, principally equipment, totaling $90 million, and Airgas common stock with
a market value of $30 million classified as treasury stock and carried at cost of $370
thousand.

Trade Receivables Securitization 

The Company participates in a securitization agreement with two commercial banks to sell
up to $225 million of qualifying trade receivables. The agreement expires in February 2008,
but may be renewed subject to provisions contained in the agreement. During the nine months
ended December 31, 2005, the Company sold, net of its retained interest, $1,748 million of
trade receivables and remitted to bank conduits, pursuant to a servicing agreement, $1,714
million in collections on those receivables. The net proceeds were used to reduce borrowings
under the Company s revolving credit facilities. The amount of outstanding receivables under
the agreement was $224 million at December 31, 2005 and $190 million at March 31, 2005.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements 

The Company manages its exposure to changes in market interest rates. At December 31,
2005, the Company was party to two interest rate swap agreements. The swap agreements are
with major financial institutions and aggregate $50 million in notional principal amount.
These swap agreements require the Company to make fixed interest payments based on an average
effective rate of 4.15% and receive variable interest payments from its counterparties based
on one-month LIBOR, which was 4.36% at December 31, 2005. The remaining terms of each of
these swap agreements is 3.4 years. The Company monitors its positions and the credit
ratings of its counterparties and does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparties.

Including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements, the debt of National Welders,
and the trade receivables securitization, the Company s ratio of fixed to variable interest
rates was approximately 53% fixed to 47% variable at December 31, 2005. A majority of the
Company s variable rate debt is based on a spread over the LIBOR. Based on the Company s
fixed to variable interest rate ratio at December 31, 2005, for every 25 basis point increase
in LIBOR, the Company estimates that its annual interest expense would increase approximately
$1 million.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

There were no material changes in the Company s contractual obligations and off-balance
sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2005 compared to those contained in the Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005.

See Item 3 of this report for the Company s estimated future obligations related to its
debt, the debt of National Welders, the off-balance sheet trade receivables securitization,
interest on the debt, and estimated future obligations under the Company s interest rate swap
agreements as of December 31, 2005. The Company s cash outlays for interest approximate
interest expense.

OTHER  

New Accounting Pronouncements 

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS )
No. 123R,  Share Based Payment,  as an amendment to SFAS 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation . SFAS 123R requires that grants of employee stock options, including shares
expected to be purchased under employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized as
compensation expense based on their fair values. SFAS 123R is effective for all annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2005. Therefore, SFAS 123R will be effective for the
Company as of April 1, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 123R on
its results of operations and financial position. The Company has not yet determined which
fair-value method and transitional provision it will adopt. See Note 12 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for the pro-forma effect on net earnings and earnings per share for the
three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, as if the Company had applied
the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to stock-based compensation.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 151,  Inventory Costs , as an amendment to the
guidance provided on  Inventory Pricing  in FASB Accounting Research Bulletin 43. SFAS 151,
which the Company is required to adopt as of April 1, 2006, clarifies the accounting for
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. This
statement requires that if the costs associated with the actual level of spoilage or
production defects are greater than the normal range of spoilage or defects, the excess costs
should be charged to current period expense. Since the Company performs limited
manufacturing, the Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS 151 will have a
material impact on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 153,  Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets,  as an
amendment to APB Opinion 29,  Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions . SFAS 153 requires
nonmonetary exchanges to be accounted for at fair value, recognizing any gains or losses, if
the fair value is determinable within reasonable limits and the transaction has commercial
substance. The Company is required to adopt SFAS 153 as of April 1, 2006. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have on its
consolidated results of operations and financial position.

On June 1, 2005, the FASB issued SFAS 154,  Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, 
which requires retrospective application to prior periods  financial statements of voluntary
changes in accounting principle, unless it is impractical to do so. The statement is
effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005.

Forward-looking Statements 

This report contains statements that are forward looking within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, but are not limited to,
statements regarding: the Company s expectation that strategic products will grow at a faster rate
than the overall economy and its focus on those products; the receipt of subsequent consideration
of $5.6 million related to the Rutland Tool divestiture; acquisitions as an important component of
the Company s growth and the ability to identify acquisition candidates to strengthen and expand
the Company s business; the repurchase of $150 million of common stock over a three-year period;
the Company s estimates of net earnings in its fiscal 2006 fourth quarter and of earnings from
continuing operations for fiscal 2006; anticipated same-store sales growth and successful pricing
actions; the impact of pricing actions on the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006; the ability of the
Company to maintain its pricing discipline, raise prices, and keep pace with rising costs; the
Company s expectation as to same-store sales percentage growth rate of hardgoods over the next few
quarters; the Company s estimate that for every increase in LIBOR of 25 basis points, interest
expense will increase approximately $1 million; the future payment of dividends; the Company s
belief that it could arrange additional sources of financing on reasonable terms; the Company s
ability to refinance its medium-term notes upon maturity with borrowings under its senior credit
agreement; the amount of the estimated loss associated with hurricanes Katrina and Rita; the
Company s ability to manage its exposure to interest rate risk of certain borrowings through
participation in interest rate swap agreements; and the performance of counterparties under
interest rate swap agreements.

These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any forward-looking statement include,
but are not limited to: adverse customer response to the Company s strategic product sales
initiatives and/or strategic products growing slower than the overall economy; underlying market
conditions; customers acceptance of price increases; adverse changes in customer buying patterns;
an economic downturn (including adverse changes in the specific markets for the Company s
products); subsequent consideration of less than $5.6 million associated with the Rutland
divestiture resulting from collection issues; the inability to identify acquisition candidates and
successfully complete and integrate acquisitions; common stock repurchases over the next three
years totaling less than $150 million; the Company s inability to meet its earnings estimates; a
rise in product costs and/or operating expenses at a rate faster than the Company s ability to
increase prices; the losses associated with Katrina and Rita that are higher or lower than that
estimated by the Company; higher than estimated interest expense resulting from increases in LIBOR;
potential disruption to the Company s business from integration problems associated with
acquisitions; the inability of management to control expenses; changes in the Company s debt levels
and/or credit rating which prevent the Company from arranging additional financing at reasonable
terms as well as negatively impacting earnings; a lack of borrowing availability under the senior
credit agreement or other financing sources that prevent the Company from refinancing the
medium-term notes upon maturity; a lack of available cash flow necessary to pay future dividends;
the inability to pay dividends as a result of loan covenant restrictions; the inability to manage
interest rate exposure; unanticipated non-performance by counterparties related to interest rate
swap agreements; the effects of competition from independent distributors and vertically integrated
gas producers on products, pricing and sales growth; changes in product prices from gas producers
and name-brand manufacturers and suppliers of hardgoods; and the effects of, and changes in, the
economy, monetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations, inflation and monetary fluctuations
and fluctuations in interest rates, both on a national and international basis. The Company does
not undertake to update any forward-looking statement made herein or that may be made from time to
time by or on behalf of the Company.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Interest Rate Risk 

The Company manages its exposure to changes in market interest rates. The interest rate
exposure arises primarily from the interest payment terms of the Company s borrowing
agreements. Interest rate swap agreements are used to adjust the interest rate risk
exposures that are inherent in its portfolio of funding sources. The Company has not, and
will not establish any interest rate risk positions for purposes other than managing the risk
associated with its portfolio of funding sources. The Company maintains the ratio of fixed
to variable rate debt within parameters established by management under policies approved by
the Board of Directors. Including the effect of interest rate swap agreements on the
Company s debt and off-balance sheet financing arrangements, the Company s ratio of fixed to
variable rate debt was 53% fixed and 47% variable at December 31, 2005. The ratio includes
the effect of the fixed to variable rate debt of National Welders. Counterparties to
interest rate swap agreements are major financial institutions. The Company has established
counterparty credit guidelines and only enters into transactions with financial institutions
with long-term credit ratings of  A  or better. In addition, the Company monitors its
position and the credit ratings of its counterparties, thereby minimizing the risk of
non-performance by the counterparties.

The table below summarizes the Company s market risks associated with debt obligations,
interest rate swaps and the trade receivables securitization as of December 31, 2005. For
debt obligations and the trade receivables securitization, the table presents cash flows related to payments of principal, interest
and the discount on the securitization program by fiscal year of maturity. For interest rate
swaps, the table presents the notional amounts underlying the agreements by year of maturity.
The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual payments to be exchanged and are not
actually paid or received. Fair values were computed using market quotes, if available, or
based on discounted cash flows using market interest rates as of the end of the period.

Table of Contents   

(a)  Fiscal 2006 financial instrument maturities and interest expense relate to the period
January 1, 2006 through March 31, 2006.

(b)  The variable rate of U.S. revolving credit facilities and term loan is based on the average
LIBOR rate of outstanding contracts as of December 31, 2005. The variable rate of the Canadian
dollar portion of the revolving credit facilities is the rate on Canadian Bankers  acceptances
as of December 31, 2005.

(c)  The trade receivables securitization agreement expires in February 2008, but may be renewed
subject to renewal provisions contained in the agreement.

Table of Contents   

Limitations of the tabular presentation 

As the table incorporates only those interest rate risk exposures that exist as of
December 31, 2005, it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after
that date. In addition, actual cash flows of financial instruments in future periods may
differ materially from prospective cash flows presented in the table due to future fluctuations
in variable interest rates, debt levels and the Company s credit rating.

Foreign Currency Rate Risk 

Canadian subsidiaries of the Company are funded in part with local currency debt. The
Company does not otherwise hedge its exposure to translation gains and losses relating to
foreign currency net asset exposures. The Company considers its exposure to foreign currency
exchange fluctuations to be immaterial to its consolidated financial position and results of
operations.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

(a)  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of
the Company s  disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2005. Based on that evaluation,
the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of
such date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in the
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.

(b)  Changes in Internal Control 

There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
the quarter ended December 31, 2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

The Company is involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings that have arisen in
the ordinary course of its business and have not been fully adjudicated. These actions, when
ultimately concluded will not, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect
upon the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

(a) Not applicable

(b) Not applicable

(c) Purchase of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated

EXHIBIT 11 

Airgas, Inc. 
Earnings Per Share Computations  
(In thousands, except per share amounts)

(1) - Pursuant to a joint venture agreement between the Company and the holders of the preferred stock of
National Welders, between June 6, 2005 and June 30, 2009, the preferred shareholders have the option to
exchange their 3.2 million preferred shares of National Welders either for cash at a price of $17.78 per share
or to tender them to the joint venture in exchange for approximately 2.3 million shares of Airgas common stock.
If Airgas common stock has a market value of $24.45 per share, the stock and cash redemption options are
equivalent.

(b) - If the preferred stockholders of National Welders convert their preferred stock to Airgas common stock,
the 5% preferred stock dividend, recognized as  Minority interest in earnings of consolidated affiliate,  would
no longer be paid to the preferred stockholders, resulting in
additional net earnings for Airgas.

(3) - The earnings of National Welders for tax purposes are treated as a deemed dividend to Airgas, net of an 80%
dividend exclusion. Upon the assumed conversion of National Welders preferred stock to Airgas common stock,
National Welders would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Airgas. As a wholly owned subsidiary,
the net earnings of National Welders would not be subject to
additional tax at the Airgas level.

(4) - The assumed conversion of National Welders preferred stock to Airgas common stock is not presented because
it was anti-dilutive.
