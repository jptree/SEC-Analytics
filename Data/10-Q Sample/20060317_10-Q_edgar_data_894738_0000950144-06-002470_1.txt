Notes to condensed consolidated financial statements (unaudited)  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Internet
Commerce Corporation (the  Company  or  ICC ) have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for
interim financial information. In the opinion of management, such statements include all
adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for the fair
presentation of the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows at
the dates and for the periods indicated. Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) applicable to Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, the
accompanying financial statements do not include all the disclosures required by GAAP for
annual financial statements. While the Company believes that the disclosures presented are
adequate to make the information not misleading, these unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and related notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended July 31, 2005. Operating results for the three and six month periods
ended January 31, 2006 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected
for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2006.

1.    Organization and Nature of Business  

The Company derives its revenue from subscriptions to its value added network ( VAN )
sold under the brand name ICC.NET , which includes transaction, mailbox and fax transmission
activities for which fees are charged. Revenue from data mapping and professional internet
services contracts is also included in this segment. In addition, the Company operates a
service bureau, the EC Service Bureau, deriving revenue from electronic data interchange
( EDI ) services including data translation services, purchase order and invoice processing
from EDI-to-print and print-to-EDI, Universal Product Code ( UPC ) number generation, UPC
catalog maintenance and UPC label printing. The Company also sells EDI software and
software maintenance, the revenue of which is immaterial in the periods presented.

2.     Recent Acquisitions  

MEC 

On March 17, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of the assets of QRS
Corporation s ( QRS ) Managed EC    business ( MEC ), from the parent company of QRS,
Inovis International, Inc. ( Inovis ). The consideration for the acquisition of these
assets was the assumption of certain liabilities that have been recorded on the Company s
books per Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141  Business Combinations 
( FASB 141 ). The Company was aided in arriving at the estimates required under FASB 141
by a third party valuation.

As part of the transaction, the Company assumed an unfavorable lease. Under FASB 141,
the Company recorded the present value of the estimated difference between the cash amounts
due under the existing terms of the lease; cash received from Inovis as part of the
transaction net of the estimated current market value of cash flows receivable under the
terms of a sublease entered into on January 16, 2006. The Company has recorded
approximately $2,268,000 as other liabilities under the assumed lease. In addition, the
Company assumed certain employee obligations, transition services fees payable to Inovis
and other estimated closing costs of the MEC New York location that have been recorded as
other accrued liabilities for approximately $376,000. The total allocated purchase price is
$2,355,481.

Under the FASB 141 allocation, the Company recorded fixed assets and leasehold
improvements of approximately $210,000, restricted cash of approximately $420,000,
intangibles for customer relationships of approximately $737,000 and goodwill of
approximately $1,433,000. Goodwill was reduced approximately $23,000 to change the amount
originally estimated to match the actual terms of the MEC sublease. The recorded fixed
assets are estimated to have a life of two years; the leasehold improvements are being
amortized over the term of the lease and the customer relationship intangible is being
amortized over five years. The recorded goodwill will be subject to annual impairment
testing under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142  Goodwill and Other
Intangibles.

Recent     Acquisitions (continued)  

The following table sets forth the components of the purchase price for MEC as of
January 31, 2006:

KODIAK GROUP, INC.  

On November 1, 2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of the Kodiak
Group, Inc. ( Kodiak ), a privately held company delivering e-commerce and global data
synchronization services to blue chip customers in a variety of industries. Under the terms
of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Company paid $1.0 million in cash on close, will pay an
additional $1 million in cash should the Kodiak operations generate revenue of no less than
$3.0 million over the first twelve months following the acquisition, and up to an additional
$0.5 million on a pro-rated basis should the Kodiak operations generate between $3.25 and $4
million in revenue over the first twelve months following the acquisition. The Company has
based its allocation of the purchase price on the assumption that the sellers of Kodiak will
not receive any of the additional payments outlined above.

The following table sets forth the components of the purchase price for Kodiak as of
January 31, 2006.

The recorded other net tangible assets are estimated to have a life of two years and
the customer relationship intangible is estimated to have a life of five years. Revenue
from the Kodiak acquisition includes professional services and mapping revenue, which is a
part of our ICC.NET segment and EDI outsourcing, which is a part of our EC Service Bureau
segment.

3.     Business Segment Information  

The Company s two operating segments are:

ICC.NET   ICC.NET is a complete VAN solution designed to meet
electronic data interchange requirements in a secure, reliable, available and
flexible environment regardless of file size, communication protocol or data

amount of information that customers transmit through our network to their
trading partners. These charges are primarily made on a set price per
 kilo-character  (every thousand bytes of information through the network). 

EC Service Bureau   The EC Service Bureau manages and translates
the data of small and mid-sized companies that exchange EDI data with large
companies and provides various EDI and Universal Product Code ( UPC ) services.
The EC Service Bureau also licenses EDI software which amounts are immaterial

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains a number of  forward-looking statements  within
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). Specifically,
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Quarterly Report
regarding our financial position, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for
future operations are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on
the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to
management. When used in this Report, the words  anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   expect, 
 may,   will,   continue  and  intend,  and words or phrases of similar import, as they relate to
our financial position, business strategy and plans, or objectives of management, are intended to
identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our current view with respect to
future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions related to various factors
including, without limitation, those factors discussed in Item 1 (Business) of Part I and Item 7
(Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) of Part II
of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on October 31, 2005, this Item 2 and Item 1A of Part II of
this Quarterly Report. You should carefully review those risks, as well as additional risks
described in other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Although we believe that our expectations are reasonable, we cannot assure you that our
expectations will prove to be correct. Should any one or more of these risks or uncertainties
materialize, or should any underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary
materially from those described in this Quarterly Report as anticipated, believed, estimated,
expected or intended.

Overview 

Internet Commerce Corporation is a pioneer in the use of the Internet for electronic data
interchange ( EDI ) business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce solutions and an operator of one of the
largest EDI service centers in the United States. EDI is an electronic standard used to provide a
more efficient exchange of business information between trading partners. Intermediaries called
value-added networks ( VAN ) are often used to facilitate EDI processes. A VAN allows each
customer to adopt its own communication protocol and allows multiple trading partners in the supply
chain to communicate electronically using a VAN as an intermediary.

Our B2B Internet and service center solutions allow thousands of customers to rely on our
solutions, expertise and support to help balance the cost and function required to meet the
individual requirements for communicating with their trading partners in compliance with partner
specifications.

Organizationally, our two segments of business are known as the:

ICC.NET segment, which is composed primarily of our VAN operations,
professional services and mapping activities, and 

Electronic Commerce Service Bureau ( EC Service Bureau ) segment, whose
operations primarily focus on facilitating the EDI communications of small and medium
sized businesses with their trading partners. 

These segments compliment one another and give us the ability to provide solutions to many
different kinds of enterprises, from sole proprietorships to large corporations, operating in a
variety of industries.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based
upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We consider certain accounting policies related to
revenue recognition, valuation of acquired intangibles and impairment

10

Table of Contents   

of long-lived assets including goodwill, and valuation of investments to be critical policies
due to the estimation process involved in each. Management discusses its estimates and judgments
with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

For a more detailed description on the application of these and other accounting policies, see
Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended July 31, 2005. Reference is also made to the discussion of the application of
these critical accounting policies and estimates contained in Management s Discussion and Analysis
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2005. During the six months ended January 31, 2006,
there were no significant or material changes in the application of critical accounting policies
that would require an update to the information provided in the Form 10-K for fiscal 2005.

Stock-Based Compensation 

In January 2004, we adopted the fair value method of recording stock-based compensation
expense in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,  Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation  ( SFAS 123 ). On December 6, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued FASB Statement No. 123R (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of
SFAS 123. Statement 123R supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statements of Cash Flows. The approach to accounting for
share-based payments in Statement 123R is similar to the approach described in Statement 123.
However, Statement 123R requires that all share-based payments to employees, including grants of
employee stock options, be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values and no
longer allows pro forma disclosure as an alternative to financial statement recognition. We
adopted the fair-value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 in January 2004 and no changes were made
to our recognition method upon adoption of Statement 123R, which became effective on August 1,
2005.

The fair value of stock options issued under stock-based compensation plans as determined on
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is being expensed over the vesting
period of the related stock options. The use of this model required management to make certain
estimates for values of variables used by the model. Management estimated the values for stock
price volatility, the expected life of the equity instruments and the risk free interest rate based
on information that was available to management at the time the Black-Scholes option-pricing
calculations were performed. During the three month period ended January 31, 2006, we recorded
non-cash charges for stock-option compensation of $287,587.

Results of Operations   Consolidated 

The following table reflects consolidated operating data by reported segments. All
significant intersegment activity has been eliminated. Accordingly, the segment results below
exclude the effect of transactions with our subsidiaries.

Results
of Operations   ICC.NET 

Our ICC.NET service uses the Internet and our proprietary technology to deliver our customers 
documents and data files to members of their trading communities. The following table summarizes
operating results for our ICC.NET service for the three months ended January 31, 2006 and
2005:

Revenues   ICC.NET    Revenue from ICC.NET services was 62% of consolidated revenues for
the quarter ended January 31, 2006 ( 2006 Quarter ) compared to 78% for the quarter ended January
31, 2005 ( 2005 Quarter ), reflecting the increased revenue in the EC Service Bureau segment due to
our recent acquisitions (see Note 2 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for
disclosures related to our recent acquisitions). ICC.NET service revenues increased $379,000, or
14%, to $3,120,000 for the 2006 Quarter compared to $2,741,000 for the 2005
Quarter. VAN service revenue increased $226,000, or 9%, to $2,835,000 for the 2006 Quarter
compared to $2,609,000 for the 2005 Quarter. The increase in VAN services revenue is attributable
to an increase in transaction volume. Professional services revenue increased $169,000, or 208%,
to $250,000 for the 2006 Quarter compared to $81,000 for the 2005 Quarter due to the Kodiak
acquisition. Mapping services revenue decreased $15,000, or 30%, to $36,000 for the 2006 Quarter
compared to $51,000 for the 2005 Quarter. We continue to experience slow demand for these
services.

Table of Contents   

Cost
of services   ICC.NET    Cost of services relating to
our ICC.NET service was 27%
of revenue from the ICC.NET services for the 2006 Quarter, compared to 38% for the 2005 Quarter.
Total cost of services decreased $226,000, or 21%, to $829,000 for the 2006 Quarter compared to
$1,055,000 for the 2005 Quarter. Cost of services consists primarily of salaries and employee
benefits, connectivity fees, amortization, allocation of product and development expenses and rent.
This decrease was primarily the result of a $239,000 reduction in amortization due to mapping
technology becoming fully amortized, an $80,000 reduction in salaries and benefits, and an $82,000
reduction in office space allocation offset by a $149,000 increase as a result of the Kodiak
acquisition.

Product development and enhancement   ICC.NET  - Product development and enhancement
costs relating to our ICC.NET service consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits. Product
development and enhancement costs decreased $16,000 to $143,000 in the 2006 Quarter from $159,000
in the 2005 Quarter.

Selling and marketing   ICC.NET  - Selling and marketing expenses relating to our
ICC.NET service consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, rent, travel-related costs,
advertising and trade-show costs. Selling and marketing expenses relating to our ICC.NET service
decreased $226,000 to $328,000 in the 2006 Quarter from $554,000 in the 2005 Quarter. This
decrease was due primarily to a $145,000 decrease in salaries and benefits and a $54,000 decrease
in the office space allocation.

General and administrative  -  ICC.NET  - General and administrative expenses supporting
our ICC.NET service consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, legal and professional
fees, facility costs, travel meals and entertainment and insurance. General and administrative
costs supporting our ICC.NET service increased $231,000 to $1,174,000 in the 2006 Quarter from
$943,000 in the 2005 Quarter. This increase was primarily due to a one-time buyout of office space
in Cary, North Carolina of $120,000, severance expense of $88,000, additions to bad debt expense of
$43,000 following a review of accounts receivable collectibility, an increase in professional fees
of $147,000, additional reoccurring general and administrative expenses from the acquired Kodiak
operations of $99,000 as well as board of director s fees of $45,000 offset by a $210,000 reversal
of the previous quarter s accrual for employee bonuses as a result of the inability to reach
targeted goals.

Non-cash charges   ICC.NET  - Non-cash charges of approximately $273,000 in the 2006
Quarter consist of $273,000 for stock options issued to employees and directors. Non-cash charges
of approximately $193,000 in the 2005 Quarter consist of $150,000 for stock options issued to
employees and directors and $43,000 for shares of our Class A Common Stock issued to non-employee
directors as compensation for 2004 directors  fees.

Results of Operations   EC Service Bureau 

Our EC Service Bureau manages and translates supply chain information for small and mid-sized
companies that exchange EDI data with other companies and provides various EDI and UPC services.
Our EC Service Bureau also licenses EDI software, which amounts are immaterial to the periods
presented. The following table summarizes operating results for our EC Service Bureau for the
three months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005:

13

Table of Contents   

Revenue   EC Service Bureau    Revenue from our EC Service Bureau was 38% of consolidated
revenues for the 2006 Quarter compared to 38% for the 2005 Quarter. The revenue increased
$1,140,000, or 152%, to $1,892,000 for the 2006 Quarter compared to $752,000 for the 2005 Quarter.
The revenue was primarily generated from services performed, customer support and licensing fees.
The increase was primarily the result of the recent acquisitions.

Cost of services   EC Service Bureau  - Cost of services relating to our EC Service Bureau was
48% of revenue derived from the EC Service Bureau in the 2006 Quarter, compared to 38% of such
revenue in the 2005 Quarter due to the increased costs associated with the MEC purchase. Cost of
services relating to our EC Service Bureau consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits,
amortization, connectivity fees and rent. Cost of services relating to our EC Service Bureau
increased $631,000 to $916,000 in the 2006 Quarter from $285,000 in the 2005 Quarter primarily due
to an increase in salaries and benefits of $614,000 related to our recent acquisitions (see Note 2
to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to our recent
acquisitions).

Product development and enhancement   EC Service Bureau  - Product development and enhancement
costs consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits. Product development and enhancement
costs incurred by our EC Service Bureau decreased $23,000 to $58,000 in the 2006 Quarter from
$81,000 in the 2005 Quarter.

Selling and marketing   EC Service Bureau  - Selling and marketing expenses relating to our EC
Service Bureau consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits and amortization. Selling and
marketing expenses incurred by our EC Service Bureau increased $82,000 to $231,000 in the 2006
Quarter from $149,000 in the 2005 Quarter due to an increase in amortization from the MEC
acquisition of $37,000 and increased expenses of $59,000 related to the Kodiak acquisition.

General and administrative   EC Service Bureau  - General and administrative expenses relating
to our EC Service Bureau consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, office expenses,
depreciation, telephone and rent. General and administrative expenses incurred by our EC Service
Bureau increased $278,000 to $646,000 in the 2006 Quarter from $368,000 in the 2005 Quarter.
Allocation of general and administrative expenses from ICC.NET increased $120,000, and bad debt
expense increased $77,000 based on a careful review of accounts receivable collectibility.
Expenses related to the acquisition of Kodiak were $190,000. These increases were partially offset
by a reduction in salaries and employee benefits of $92,000.

Non-cash charges   EC Service Bureau  - Non-cash charges of approximately $15,000 in
the 2006 Quarter consist of stock options issued to employees. No non-cash charge was recorded for
the 2005 Quarter.

Results
of Operations   ICC.NET 

Our ICC.NET service, our global Internet-based VAN, uses the Internet and our proprietary
technology to deliver our customers  documents and data files to members of their trading
communities. The following table summarizes operating results for our ICC.NET service for
the six months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005:

Revenues   ICC.NET    Revenue from ICC.NET services was 61% of consolidated revenues for
the six months ended January 31, 2006 ( 2006 Six Months ) compared to 77% for the six months ended
January 31, 2005 ( 2005 Six Months ), reflecting the increased revenue in the EC Service Bureau
segment due to our recent acquisitions (see Note 2 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements for disclosures related to our recent acquisitions). ICC.NET service revenues increased
$588,000, or 11%, to $6,155,000 for the 2006 Six Months compared to $5,567,000 for the 2005 Six
Months. VAN service revenue increased $458,000, or 9%, to $5,689,000 for the 2006 Six
Months compared to $5,231,000 for the 2005 Six Months. The increase in VAN services revenue is
attributable to an increase in transaction volume. Professional services revenue increased
$164,000, or 75%, to $384,000 for the 2006 Six Months compared to $220,000 for the 2005 Six Months
due to the Kodiak acquisition. Mapping services revenue decreased $33,000, or 29%, to $83,000 for
the 2006 Six Months compared to $116,000 for the 2005 Six Months. We continue to experience slow
demand for these services.

Cost
of services   ICC.NET    Cost of services relating to
our ICC.NET service was 30%
of revenue from the ICC.NET services for the 2006 Six Months, compared to 41% for the 2005 Six
Months. Total cost of services decreased $421,000, or 19%, to $1,835,000 for the 2006 Six Months
compared to $2,256,000 for the 2005 Six Months. Cost of services consists primarily of salaries
and employee benefits, connectivity fees, amortization, allocation of product and development
expenses and rent. This decrease was primarily the result of a $239,000 reduction in amortization
due to mapping technology becoming fully amortized, a reduction in salaries and benefits of
$147,000, and a $102,000 decrease in rent due primarily to a decrease in office space allocation.
These increases were partially offset by an increase of $149,000 as a result of the Kodiak
acquisition.

Product development and enhancement   ICC.NET  - Product development and enhancement
costs relating to our ICC.NET service consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits. Product
development and enhancement costs decreased $123,000 to $171,000 in the 2006 Six Months from
$294,000 in the 2005 Six Months primarily due to a reduction in salaries and benefits of $86,000
and a $51,000 decrease in rent due primarily to a decrease in office space allocation.

Selling and marketing   ICC.NET  - Selling and marketing expenses relating to our
ICC.NET service consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, rent, travel-related costs,
advertising and trade-show costs. Selling and marketing expenses relating to our ICC.NET service
decreased $669,000 to $573,000 in the 2006 Six Months from $1,242,000 in the 2005 Six Months. This
decrease was due primarily to a $385,000 decrease in salaries and

15

Table of Contents   

benefits, a $60,000 decrease in travel expenses attributable to a decrease in the number of
employees traveling, a $112,000 decrease in the office space allocation, and a $42,000 increase in
the ICC.NET allocation of a portion of the cost of selling and marketing functions to the EC
Service Bureau.

General and administrative  -  ICC.NET  - General and administrative expenses supporting
our ICC.NET service consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, legal and professional
fees, facility costs, travel, meals and entertainment and insurance. General and administrative
costs supporting our ICC.NET service increased $361,000 to $2,374,000 in the 2006 Six Months from
$2,013,000 in the 2005 Six Months. This increase was primarily due to a one-time buyout of office
space in Cary, North Carolina of $120,000, severance expense of $88,000, additions to bad debt
expense of $92,000 following a review of accounts receivable collectibility, an increase in
professional fees of $83,000, an increase in depreciation of $51,000, an increase in consultant
fees of $43,000, an increase in printing costs of $35,000, additional reoccurring general and
administrative expenses from the acquired Kodiak operations of $99,000 as well as board of
director s fees of $45,000.

Non-cash charges   ICC.NET  - Non-cash charges of approximately $456,000 in the 2006
Six Months consist of $402,000 for stock options issued to employees and directors and $54,000 for
shares of our Class A Common Stock to be issued to non-employee directors as compensation for the
first quarter of fiscal year 2006 directors  fees. Non-cash charges of approximately $404,000 in
the 2005 Six Months consist of $329,000 for stock options issued to employees and directors and
$75,000 for shares of our Class A Common Stock issued to non-employee directors as compensation.

Results of Operations   EC Service Bureau 

Our EC Service Bureau manages and translates supply chain information for small and mid-sized
companies that exchange EDI data with other companies and provides various EDI and UPC services.
Our EC Service Bureau also licenses EDI software, which amounts are immaterial for the periods
presented. The following table summarizes operating results for our EC Service Bureau for the six
months ended January 31, 2006 and 2005:

Revenue   EC Service Bureau    Revenue from our EC Service Bureau was 39% of consolidated
revenues for the 2006 Six Months compared to 23% for the 2005 Six Months. The revenue increased
$2,202,000, or 132%, to $3,875,000 for the 2006 Six Months compared to $1,673,000 for the 2005 Six
Months. The revenue was primarily generated from services performed, customer support and
licensing fees. The increase was primarily the result of recent acquisitions.

Cost of services   EC Service Bureau  - Cost of services relating to our EC Service Bureau was
47% of revenue derived from the EC Service Bureau in the 2006 Six Months, compared to 30% of such
revenue in the 2005 Six Months due to increased costs associated with the MEC purchase. Cost of
services relating to our EC Service Bureau consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits,
amortization, connectivity fees and rent. Cost of services relating to our EC Service Bureau
increased $1,308,000 to $1,810,000 in the 2006 Six Months from

16

Table of Contents   

$502,000 in the 2005 Six Months primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits of
$1,222,000 related to our recent acquisitions (see Note 2 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements for disclosures related to our recent acquisitions).

Product development and enhancement   EC Service Bureau  - Product development and enhancement
costs consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits. Product development and enhancement
costs incurred by our EC Service Bureau decreased $39,000 to $131,000 in the 2006 Six Months from
$170,000 in the 2005 Six Months primarily due to a reduction in salaries and benefits of $32,000.

Selling and marketing   EC Service Bureau  - Selling and marketing expenses relating to our EC
Service Bureau consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits and amortization. Selling and
marketing expenses incurred by our EC Service Bureau increased $97,000 to $395,000 in the 2006 Six
Months from $298,000 in the 2005 Six Months due to an increase in amortization from the MEC
acquisition of $74,000, an increase in the ICC.NET allocation of a portion of the cost of selling
and marketing functions to the EC Service Bureau of $42,000, and increased expenses of $59,000
related to Kodiak operations. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in salaries and
benefits of $57,000.

General and administrative   EC Service Bureau  - General and administrative expenses relating
to our EC Service Bureau consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, office expenses,
depreciation, telephone and rent. General and administrative expenses incurred by our EC Service
Bureau increased $368,000 to $1,129,000 in the 2006 Six Months from $761,000 in the 2005 Six
Months. Allocation of general and administrative expenses from ICC.NET increased $240,000, and bad
debt expense increased $126,000 based on a careful review of accounts receivable collectibility.
Expenses related to Kodiak operations were $190,000. These increases were partially offset by a
reduction in salaries and employee benefits of $110,000 and a reduction in consultant expenses of
$29,000.

Non-cash charges   EC Service Bureau  - Non-cash charges of approximately $19,000 in
the 2006 Six Months consist of stock options issued to employees. No non-cash charge was recorded
for the 2005 Six Months.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our principal sources of liquidity, which consist of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents,
increased to $4,294,000 as of January 31, 2006 from $3,983,000 as of July 31, 2005. We believe
these resources will provide us with sufficient liquidity to continue in operation through January
31, 2007.

On May 30, 2003, we executed an Accounts Receivable Financing Agreement ( Financing
Agreement ) with Silicon Valley Bank ( Bank ) with an initial term of one year. Under the
Financing Agreement, we may borrow, subject to certain conditions, up to 80% of our outstanding
accounts receivable up to a maximum of $2,000,000. The Financing Agreement was amended on October
22, 2003, August 31, 2004, and March 16, 2005. As of the last amendment to the Financing
Agreement, the applicable interest rate is the prime rate plus .25% as long as our adjusted quick
ratio is 1.25% or greater and prime rate plus .75% if our adjusted quick ratio is less than 1.25%.
We also pay a collateral handling fee equal to .15% on the average daily outstanding receivable
balance as long as its adjusted quick ratio is 1.25% or greater, going to .35% if our adjusted
quick ratio is less than 1.25%. Interest under the Financing Agreement is payable monthly. The
Financing Agreement prohibits the payment of dividends other than dividends on our Series C
Preferred Stock, which may not exceed $400,000 in any fiscal year. The Bank has been granted a
security interest in substantially all of our assets.

The last Financing Agreement amendment extends its term through March 16, 2006. At January
31, 2006, there were no amounts outstanding under the Financing Agreement. The Bank exercised
warrants issued to it under the Financing Agreement on September 30, 2005. These warrants were
immediately exercisable at a price of $1.39, equal to the fair market value of the Class A Common
Stock on the date of closing of the Financing Agreement. The Bank elected the option to convert the
warrants into 20,283 shares of Class A Common Stock using the cashless exercise formula specified
in the warrant.

During the quarter ending January 31, 2006, 461,213 stock options were exercised resulting in
the issuance of 155,617 shares of Class A Common Stock for which we received $182,468. 355,713
options were redeemed in cashless exercises.

We have a net operating loss carryforward of approximately $76.4 million to offset future
taxable income for federal income tax purposes. The utilization of the loss carryforward to reduce
any such future income taxes will depend on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income prior
to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards. The carryforwards expire from 2007 to
2024. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder
contain provisions that limit the use of available net operating loss carryforwards in any given
year should significant changes (greater than 50%) in ownership interests occur. Due to a private
placement of Series A Preferred Stock in April 1999, the net operating loss carryover of
approximately $19.7 million incurred prior to the private placement and subsequent to the initial
public offering is subject to an annual limitation of approximately $1.4 million until that portion
of the net operating loss is utilized or expires. Due to the 100% ownership change when we acquired
Research Triangle Commerce, Inc. ( RTCI ) in November 2000, RTCI s net operating loss of
approximately $6.3 million incurred prior to the ownership change is subject to an annual
limitation of approximately $1.1 million until that portion of the net operating loss is utilized
or expires. Additionally, the issuance of ICC stock in connection with the RTCI acquisition noted
above resulted in an ownership change for ICC in November 2000. The ICC net operating loss
carryforward of approximately $49.4 million incurred prior to the ownership change is subject to an
annual limitation of approximately $2.8 million until that portion of net operating loss is
utilized or expires. Finally, due to a 100% ownership change of Electronic Commerce Systems, Inc.
( ECS ) in June 2004, the acquired net operating loss of approximately $1.1 million incurred prior
to the ownership change is subject to an annual limitation of approximately $128,000 until that
portion of the net operating loss is utilized or expires.

Consolidated Working Capital 

Consolidated working capital increased to $6,707,000 at January 31, 2006 from $4,864,000 at
July 31, 2005. This increase was primarily due to an increase in cash of $311,000 primarily
resulting from increased accounts receivable collections, a decrease in accrued expenses of
$865,000 primarily due to the cash payments under our 2005 bonus program, and a decrease in other
current liabilities of $476,000 primarily due to the payment of rent for the MEC office space.

Analysis of Cash Flows 

Cash provided by operating activities was $1,033,000 in the six months ended January 31, 2006
compared to cash used by operating activities of $300,000 in the six months ended January 31, 2005.
The increase in the six months ended January 31, 2006 of $1,333,000 was primarily the result of
net income of $1,094,000 in the six months ended January 31, 2006 compared to a net loss of
$690,000 in the six months ended January 31, 2005 reduced by a decrease of $699,000 in other
liabilities primarily due to payments on the MEC lease.

Cash used in investing activities increased to $1,066,000 in the six months ended January 31,
2006 from $280,000 in the six months ended January 31, 2005. Cash used in investing activities in
the six months ended January 31, 2006 resulted from the purchase of property and equipment of
$115,000, additional costs relating to the MEC acquisition of $65,000, and the Kodiak Group
acquisition of $886,000. Cash used in investing activities in the six months ended January 31,
2005 resulted from the purchase of property and equipment of $158,000 and additional costs relating
to the ECS acquisition of $121,000.

Cash provided by financing activities was $345,000 in the six months ended January 31, 2006
compared to cash used in financing activities of $60,000 in the six months ended January 31, 2005.
Cash provided by financing activities in the six months ended January 31, 2006 was the result of
proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $349,000 offset by payments of capital
lease obligations of $4,000. Cash used in financing activities in the six months ended January 31,
2005 was the result of common stock issued for services related to the 2004 private placement of
$24,000 and capital lease payments of $36,000.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Interest Rate Risk 

We may invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments, including taxable and
tax-advantaged floating rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations, municipalities, and local,
state and national governmental entities and agencies. We account for our investment instruments
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting

18

Table of Contents   

Standards No. 115,  Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities  ( SFAS
No. 115 ). All of the cash equivalents and investments are treated as available-for-sale under
SFAS No. 115. Investments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents have original
maturities of three months or less. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest
earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their
fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate
securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these
factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest
rates, or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline
in market value due to changes in interest rates. For the quarter ended January 31, 2006, our cash
investments, if any, consisted entirely of overnight cash sweep accounts invested in a fund
composed primarily of triple A rated commercial paper and government agency bonds. As of January
31, 2006, the interest rate for this investment was 3.73%.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has carried
out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31,
2006, pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of such date, our
disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There was no change in our internal control over
financial reporting during the quarter ended January 31, 2006 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

On January 6, 2006 we filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the United States
Bankruptcy Court naming Omega Liquidating Trust ( Omega ) and Cable   Wireless PLC ( C W ) as
defendants. We seek to have Omega, as the liquidating trust for the bankrupt Cable   Wireless USA
( C W USA ), declared the rightful owner of our Series C Preferred Stock and of any of our Class A
Common Stock that have been issued but not distributed as dividends of the Series C Preferred
Stock. On February 7, 2006 both Omega and C W stipulated to March 10, 2006 as the last date upon
which to respond to this complaint.   See Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities  

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

The following sets forth the risk factors previously disclosed in our Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended October 31, 2005 filed on December 13, 2005, with updates to the risk factor entitled
   If we are not successful in selling our products and services, particularly from our EC Service
Bureau segment, our results of operations will suffer.   

Risks Relating to Our Company  

We have only recently begun to realize a profit, and may incur losses again.   We reported our
first profit ever for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2005. There can be no assurances that we may
not incur losses again in the future. We have incurred significant losses since we were founded in
1991, and, as of July 31, 2005, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $85.7 million.

We must continue to grow our business in order to remain competitive.   Over the past year, the
VAN business has remained significantly price competitive. Our major competitors appear to be
restructuring their VAN operations to reduce their overhead and other costs to better compete
against Internet-based networks such as our ICC.NET service. While we have been successful in
maintaining our margins and we have increased the volume of data transmitted through our VAN, we
have experienced price erosion in competing for larger customers. Although we expect to continue
to add new customers and increase the volume of data transmitted through our service, we do not
expect our revenue from VAN services to continue to grow as rapidly as in the past. If our
revenues grow at a slower rate than we anticipate, or decrease and we are unable to adjust spending
in a timely manner or if our expenses increase without commensurate increases in revenues, our
operating results will suffer and we may again report losses.

If we are not successful in selling our products and services, particularly from our EC
Service Bureau segment, our results of operations will suffer  . While our primary focus in the past
has been on growing our ICC.NET VAN service, we have attempted to diversify by acquiring ECS in
June 2004 and the MEC operations in March 2005. We expect that our revenue from the ICC.NET
segment will drop to approximately 60% of total revenue beginning in Fiscal 2006 and the revenue
from the EC Service Bureau segment will grow to approximately 40% of total revenue. However, the
success of our services depends to a large extent on the future of business-to-business electronic
commerce and our ability to effectively compete in the marketplace. In particular, our success
depends on the number of customers that subscribe to our services, the volume of the data,
documents or other information they send or retrieve and the price we are able to charge for these
services in light of competitive pressures. In connection with the assimilation of our new EC
Service Bureau customers acquired from the MEC operation, we anticipate to see attrition to this
newly acquired customer base due to the seasonal downturn experienced in the industries where these
customers deal in, and as a result a portion of our revenues from the EC Service Bureau segment may
be adversely affected by the seasonal slowdown. While we are managing to learn about the seasonal
trends of these new customers  industries, there is no assurance that we will accurately assess the
seasonal trends of unfamiliar industries. Accordingly, the value of these new customers, the volume
of our services subscribed by them and the possibility of payment collection may differ materially
from our current expectation. Further, since our operating expense levels are based significantly
on our expectations of future revenue, our inability to assess the trends may render us vulnerable
in the case of a significant shortfall in revenues or orders from these new customers, in which
case we may not be able to reduce our operating expenses quickly in response. Therefore, any
significant shortfall in revenue or orders could have an immediate adverse effect on our operating
results.

We may not be successful in competing against our competitors.   We face a significant number
of competitors, ranging from very large enterprises or divisions of very large companies to a
number of relatively small organizations. These competitors are diverse in terms of their
histories, business models, corporate strategies, financial strength, name recognition, company
reputation, customer base and breadth of offerings. Many of our large competitors have more
history, significantly greater financial resources, larger customer bases and more easily
recognized names than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to
changing technology and changes in customer requirements or be able to undertake more extensive
marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to
potential customers and employees, or be able to devote greater resources to the development,
promotion and sale of their services than we can. New competition is emerging in the form of web
services networks, collaborative applications, application service providers, e-marketplaces and
integration broker suites. We have enhanced our technologies to communicate with these AS2-based
technologies. As described above, we have developed new product and service offerings (AS2 and
Data Synchronization) to improve our value proposition. However, there can be no assurance that
these new product and service offerings will compete effectively and generate any significant
revenues. Competitors providing these alternatives include Cyclone Corporation and Inovis. They
offer software solutions that utilize the Internet to transmit data between trading partners. We
believe that the high cost of implementation and the ongoing costs of supporting a company s
trading partners are a barrier to the wider acceptance of some of these product offerings in the
marketplace.

If we are unable to maintain or replace our existing interconnect arrangements, our results of
operations would suffer.   We rely on many of our competitors to interconnect with our service to
promote an  open community  so all businesses can take advantage of the efficiencies of EDI, no
matter what network they choose as their provider. In September 2001 and April 2002, two of our
competitors, GXS and Sterling Commerce, terminated existing interconnect agreements with us, and we
made alternative arrangements to serve our customers. However, GXS has subsequently purchased the
company that was providing our alternative arrangement. Although we have a contract for
interconnect services with the combined GXS through April 2006, there can be no assurances that the
contract will be renewed or that the renewal will be at an acceptable cost. If not renewed, we
will have to find an acceptable alternative.

We must continue to develop new products and services.   If we do not keep pace with rapid
technological changes, customer demands and intense competition, we will not be successful. Our
market is characterized by rapidly changing technology, customer demands and intense competition.
The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our network infrastructure, customer
support and document delivery systems and our web site are critical to our reputation and our
ability to attract customers and maintain adequate customer service levels. If we cannot keep pace
with these changes and maintain the performance and reliability of our network and customer service
levels, our business will suffer. The Internet s recent growth and the intense competition in our
industry require us to continue to develop strategic business and Internet solutions that enhance
and improve the customer service features, functions and responsiveness of our ICC.NET and other
proposed services and that keep pace with continuing changes in information technology and customer
requirements. We are actively searching for ways to expand our business and the products and
services we offer to keep pace with the rapidly changing technology, customer demands and intense
competition. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to keep pace with these
changes, and if we are not successful in developing and marketing enhancements to our ICC.NET VAN
or other EC Service Bureau proposed services that respond to technological change or customer
demands, our business will suffer.

We may need to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms to continue to compete
successfully.   If we are unable to obtain necessary future capital, our business will suffer. We
may need to raise additional funds if competitive pressures or technological changes are greater
than anticipated, if we are unable to increase revenue at anticipated rates, if our expenses
increase significantly or if our customers delay payment of our receivables or if we identify a
suitable acquisition candidate that requires a cash outlay in order to complete the transaction.
We cannot assure you that any additional financing will be available on reasonable terms or at all.
Raising additional funds in the future by issuing securities could adversely affect our
stockholders and negatively impact our operating results. If we raise additional funds through the
issuance of debt securities, the holders of the debt securities will have a claim to our assets
that will have priority over any claim of our stockholders. The interest on these debt securities
would increase our costs and negatively impact our operating results. If we raise additional funds
through the issuance of Class A Common Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
Class A Common Stock, the

21

Table of Contents   

percentage ownership of our then-existing stockholders will decrease and they may experience
additional dilution. In addition, any convertible or exchangeable securities may have rights,
preferences and privileges more favorable to the holders than those of the Class A Common Stock.

We rely on third parties to provide our services, and any failure of such third parties could
adversely affect our business.   Failure of our third-party providers to provide adequate Internet
and telecommunications service could result in significant losses of revenue. Our operations
depend upon third parties for Internet access and telecommunications service. Frequent or
prolonged interruptions of these services could result in significant losses of revenues. We have
experienced outages in the past and could experience outages, delays and other difficulties due to
system failures unrelated to our internal activities in the future. These types of occurrences
could also cause users to perceive our services as not functioning properly and therefore cause
them to use other methods to deliver and receive information. We have limited control over these
third parties and cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain satisfactory relationships
with any of them on acceptable commercial terms or that the quality of services that they provide
will remain at the levels needed to enable us to conduct our business effectively.

We may suffer systems failures and business interruptions that would harm our business.   Our
success depends in part on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our VAN service, which is
required to accommodate a high volume of traffic. Almost all of our network operating systems are
located at the Securities Industry Automation Corporation ( SIAC ). SIAC runs all computing
operations for the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange. Our systems are
vulnerable to events such as damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins
and earthquakes. This could lead to interruptions or delays in our service, loss of data or the
inability to accept, transmit and confirm customer documents and data. Although we have
implemented network security measures, our servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses,
electronic break-ins, attempts by third parties to deliberately exceed the capacity of our systems
and similar disruptions.

If we are unable to manage our growth or successfully integrate acquisitions, our financial
results will suffer.   Our ability to implement our business plan successfully in a new and rapidly
evolving market requires effective planning and growth management. If we cannot manage the
integration of anticipated acquisitions, our business and financial results will suffer. We expect
that we will need to continue to manage and to expand multiple relationships with customers,
Internet service providers and other third parties. We also expect that we will need to continue
to improve our financial systems, procedures and controls and will need to expand, train and manage
our workforce, particularly our information technology and sales and marketing staffs.

If we lose our net operating loss carryforward, our financial results will suffer.   Our net
operating loss carryforward is approximately $76.6 million. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue
Code contains rules designed to discourage persons from buying and selling the net operating losses
of companies. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes among stockholders
owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the common stock of a company or any change in
ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by a company. In general, the rules limit the
ability of a company to utilize net operating losses after a change of ownership of more than 50%
of its common stock over a three-year period. Purchases of our Class A Common Stock in amounts
greater than specified levels could inadvertently create a limitation on our ability to utilize our
net operating losses for tax purposes in the future. We are currently subject to a limitation on
the utilization of our net operating loss carryforward.

If we cannot successfully expand our business outside of the United States, our revenues and
operating results will be adversely affected.   Our current and future customers are conducting
their businesses internationally. As a result, one component of our business strategy is to expand
our international marketing and sales efforts, and if we do not successfully expand our business in
this way, we may lose current and future customers.

If we cannot hire and retain highly qualified employees, our business and financial results
will suffer.   We are substantially dependent on the continued services and performance of our
executive officers and other key employees. If we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain
highly qualified employees, our management may not be able to effectively manage our business,
exploit opportunities and respond to competitive challenges and our business and financial results
will suffer. Many of our competitors may be able to offer more lucrative compensation packages and
higher-profile employment opportunities than we can.

We depend on our intellectual property, which may be difficult and costly to protect.   If we
fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, competitors could offer similar products relying
on technologies we developed, potentially harming our competitive position and decreasing our
revenues. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by limiting access to the
distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information and by relying on a
combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws. In addition, we enter into
confidentiality agreements with our employees and certain customers, vendors and strategic
partners. In some circumstances, however, we may, if required by a business relationship, provide
our licensees with access to our data model and other proprietary information underlying our
licensed applications. Despite the precautions we take, it may be possible for unauthorized third
parties to copy aspects of our current or future products or to obtain and use information that we
regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of software is difficult, and some foreign laws
do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as United States laws. Litigation may be
necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets
or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, any of which could be
costly and adversely affect our operating results.

Intellectual property infringement claims against us could harm our business.   Our business
activities and our ICC.NET service may infringe upon the proprietary rights of others and other
parties may assert infringement claims against us. Any such claims and any resulting litigation
could subject us to significant liability for damages and could invalidate our proprietary rights.
We could be required to enter into royalty and licensing agreements, which may be costly or
otherwise burdensome or which may not be available on terms acceptable to us.

We must comply in the future with new and costly reporting requirements.   Under current
Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, we are considered a non-accelerated filer, as our
market capitalization as of July 31, 2005 was under $75 million. As long as our market
capitalization remains under $75 million through January 31, 2006, we will have to be compliant
with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ( SOX ) by July 31, 2007. The costs of
implementing the requirements of the SOX have ranged from approximately $500,000 to over $1 million
for smaller companies. Although we began our SOX compliance efforts in fiscal year of 2005, there
can be no assurance that we can be in full compliance when required for reasonable costs.

Risks Relating to the Internet and Online Commerce Aspects of Our Business  

If Internet usage does not continue to grow or if its infrastructure fails, our business will
suffer.   If the Internet does not gain increased acceptance for business-to-business electronic
commerce, the growth of our business will be adversely affected. We cannot be certain that the
infrastructure or complementary services necessary to maintain the Internet as a useful and easy
means of transferring documents and data will continue to develop. The Internet infrastructure may
not support the demands that growth may place on it and the performance and reliability of the
Internet may decline.

Privacy concerns may prevent customers from using our services.   Concerns about the security
of online transactions and the privacy of users may inhibit the growth of the Internet as a means
of delivering business documents and data. We may need to incur significant expenses to protect
against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches. We
rely upon encryption and authentication technology to provide secure transmission of confidential
information. If our security measures do not prevent security breaches, we could suffer operating
losses, damage to our reputation, litigation and possible liability. Advances in computer
capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments that render
current encryption technology outdated may result in a breach of our encryption and authentication
technology and could enable an outside party to steal proprietary information or interrupt our
operations.

Government regulation and legal uncertainties relating to the Internet could harm our
business.   Changes in the regulatory environment in the United States and other countries could
decrease our revenues and increase our costs. The Internet is largely unregulated and the laws
governing the Internet remain unsettled, even in areas where there has been some legislative
action. It may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing
intellectual property, privacy and taxation apply to the Internet. In addition, because of
increasing popularity and use of the Internet, any number of laws and regulations may be adopted in
the United States and other countries relating to the Internet or other online services covering
issues such as user privacy, security, pricing and taxation, content and distribution. The cost of
transmitting documents and data over the Internet could increase. We may not be able to increase
our prices to cover these rising costs. Also, foreign and

23

Table of Contents   

state laws and regulations relating to the provision of services over the Internet are still
developing. If individual states or foreign countries impose taxes or laws that negatively impact
services provided over the Internet, our cost of providing our ICC.NET and other services may
increase.

Risks Relating to our Class A Common Stock  

The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile.   The market price of our
Class A Common Stock has been very volatile in the past, ranging from a low of $0.69 to a high of
$2.19 to during fiscal 2005 and is likely to fluctuate substantially in the future. If our Class A
Common Stock falls under $1.00 per share and fails to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 for 30
consecutive trading days, it may no longer be eligible for trading in the Nasdaq SmallCap Market.

Shares eligible for future sale by our existing stockholders may adversely affect our stock
price.   Between January 1, 2003 and October 2004, we registered on one or more registration
statements, an aggregate of 9,987,817 shares of our Class A Common Stock, which includes 3,016,917
shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants to purchase shares of Class A
Common Stock and 192,307 shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of our Series D
Preferred. The market price of our Class A Common Stock could be materially and adversely affected
by sales of even a small percentage of these shares or the perception that these sales could occur.
As a result, it may be difficult to sell our Class A Common Stock.

There is not a significant demand for our common stock, which may make it difficult to sell.  
The market for our Class A Common Stock on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market may be illiquid, which would
restrict the ability to sell shares of Class A Common Stock and could result in increased
volatility in the trading prices for our Class A Common Stock. The price at which our Class A
Common Stock will trade in the future cannot be predicted and will be determined by the market.
The price may be influenced by many factors, including investors  perceptions of our business, our
financial condition, operating results and prospects, the use of the Internet for business purposes
and general economic and market conditions.

Our Board of Directors can issue preferred stock with rights adverse to the holders of Class A
Common Stock.   Our Board of Directors is authorized, without further stockholder approval, to
determine the provisions of and to issue up to 4,979,575 shares of preferred stock. Issuance of
preferred shares with rights to dividends and other distributions, voting rights or other rights
superior to the Class A Common Stock could be adverse to the holders of Class A Common Stock. In
addition, issuance of preferred shares could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing
an unsolicited change in control of our company, or could impose various procedural and other
requirements that could make it more difficult for holders of our Class A Common Stock to effect
certain corporate actions, including the replacement of incumbent directors and the completion of
transactions opposed by the incumbent Board of Directors. The rights of the holders of our Class A
Common Stock would be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of
any preferred stock that may be issued in the future.

We may have to use significant resources indemnifying our officers and directors or paying for
damages caused by their conduct.   The Delaware General Corporation Law provides for broad
indemnification by corporations of their officers and directors and permits a corporation to
exculpate its directors from liability for their actions. Our bylaws and certificate of
incorporation implement this indemnification and exculpation to the fullest extent permitted under
this law as it currently exists or as it may be amended in the future. Consequently, subject to
this law and to some limited exceptions in our certificate of incorporation, none of our directors
will be liable to us or to our stockholders for monetary damages resulting from conduct as a
director.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

None.

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 

On October 14, 2004, our Board of Directors declared a dividend on our Series C Preferred
Stock for 2004 payable on January 1, 2005 in shares of Class A Common Stock in the amount of
$400,000, which, per the terms of the Series C Preferred Stock, amounted to 236,267 shares. After
we had recorded the issuance of the shares as

24

Table of Contents   

payment for the dividend, but before the certificate representing the Class A Common Stock was
physically issued, we began discussions with C W, purported owner of the Series C Preferred Stock,
about retiring the Series C Preferred Stock. As these discussions progressed, we realized that
there was substantial evidence that the Series C Preferred Stock was held by C W USA, a formerly
wholly owned subsidiary of C W that filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States on December 8,
2003. As of January 1, 2006 an additional dividend to be paid in shares of Class A Common Stock in
the amount of $400,000, which, per the terms of the Series C Preferred Stock, amounted to 141,844
shares came due. Again, we have recorded the issuance of the shares as payment for the dividend
but will not issue the certificate representing these additional shares of Class A Common Stock
until the ownership of these shares is conclusively settled in the United States Bankruptcy Court.
  See Item 1. Legal Proceedings.  

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders 

(a) Our 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the  Annual Meeting ) was held on January 4,
2006. There were present at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, holders of 14,622,240
shares (or 80.8%) of the common stock entitled to vote.

(b) The following directors were elected to hold office until the next annual meeting of
stockholders or until their successors are elected and qualified, with the vote for each director
being reflected below:

Donald R. Harkleroad, Kim D. Cooke, John S. Simon, and Thomas J. Stallings also continued as
our directors after the Annual Meeting.

The affirmative vote of the holders of a plurality of the outstanding shares of common stock
represented at the Annual Meeting was required to elect each director.

(c) (i) Our
proposed amendment of our bylaws to declassify our board of directors and provide
for annual re-election was ratified with 5,013,077 affirmative votes cast, 33,424 negative votes
cast and 11,060 abstentions. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of common stock voting on the proposal at the Annual Meeting was required to ratify the
amendment of bylaws.

(ii) The
adoption of the Internet Commerce Corporation 2005 Stock Incentive Plan ( Plan ) was
ratified with 4,329,850 affirmative votes cast, 450,938 negative votes cast and 276,773
abstentions. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common
stock voting on the proposal at the Annual Meeting was required to ratify the adoption of the Plan.

(iii) The appointment of Tauber   Balser, P.C. as independent public auditors to audit the
consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year ending July 31,
2006, was ratified with 15,502,114 affirmative votes cast, 54,111 negative votes cast and 66,056
abstentions. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common
stock voting on the proposal  at the Annual Meeting was required to ratify the appointment of Tauber   Balser,
P.C.
