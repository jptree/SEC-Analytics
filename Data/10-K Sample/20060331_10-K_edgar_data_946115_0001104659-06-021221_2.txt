Corporation. Target Receivables Corporation is the Transferor of the receivables
to the Trust, the Depositor of the collateral certificate into the Target

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  

Target National Bank  

  Its Officers and Directors  

  As Servicer  

We have examined management s
assertion in the accompanying report, Report of Management on Compliance, dated
February 15, 2006, that Target National Bank (the Bank), as Servicer, complied
in all material respects with the administration and servicing requirements of
Article III, Article IV, and Section 8.8 of the Amended and Restated Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, dated April 28, 2000, and the applicable provisions of
the Series 2002-1 Supplement, dated July 2, 2002, and the Series 2005-1
Supplement, dated November 9, 2005, to the Target Credit Card Master Trust, as
set forth in Exhibit A to the accompanying Report of Management on Compliance
as of December 31, 2005, and for the fiscal year then ended. The Bank s
management is responsible for the Bank s compliance with those requirements.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion based on
our examination.  

Our examination was conducted
in accordance with attestation standards established by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Bank s compliance with those
requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in
the circumstances. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the
Bank s compliance with specified requirements.  

In our opinion, management s
assertion that the Bank complied with the aforementioned requirements as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects.
