Security Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1)  Accounting and Financial Reporting Policies
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Security Capital Corporation and all of its subsidiaries engaged in continuing
operations ("Security Capital" or the "Company"). The Company's subsidiaries
include Possible Dreams, Ltd., a Delaware corporation, which acquired
substantially all the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Possible Dreams,
Ltd. and Columbia National Corporation, both Massachusetts corporations, on May
17, 1996. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. The condensed consolidated financial statements
included herein have been prepared by Security Capital, in accordance with the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, without audit.

Security Capital's accounting and financial reporting policies conform with
generally accepted accounting principles and include adjustments in interim
periods, consisting only of normal recurring items, considered necessary for a
fair presentation of the financial statements. Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted
pursuant to such rules and regulations, although Security Capital believes that
the accompanying disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not
misleading. Prior period financial statements are presented for comparative
purposes. It is suggested that these condensed consolidated financial statements
be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes
thereto included in the latest Annual Report of Security Capital on Form 10-K.

This report is a transitional report, due to the Company's Board of Directors,
on February 13, 1997, approving the change in fiscal years from September 30 to
December 31. This change to a calendar year will more accurately reflect the
business cycle of the collectibles industry. This report is being filed pursuant
to Rule 240.13a-10(c) under the Securites Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for
the period October 1, 1996 through December 31, 1996.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2)  Federal Income Taxes
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" during fiscal year 1994. SFAS No. 109
requires the Company to compute deferred income taxes based on the difference
between the financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities
using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are
expected to reverse. The adoption had no effect on financial position or results
of operations because of a 100% valuation allowance applied against the deferred
tax assets.

The tax effects of the items comprising the Company's net deferred tax assets at
September 30, 1996 in the Company's statement of financial position are as
follows:

                                                September 30, 1996

In addition, in connection with the disposition of a former subsidiary of the
Company, the Company incurred a tax loss amounting to approximately $26 million.
The Company believes that a substantial portion of this loss is an ordinary loss
for Federal income tax purposes which may be carried forward to 2004, although
there can be no assurance that this position would prevail, if challenged. The
Company's Federal income tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue
Service (the "IRS") through fiscal year 1986 and the above loss carryforwards,
including the loss on disposition of the aforementioned subsidiary, remain
subject to review by the IRS.

(3)  Earnings Per Share  Fiscal Year 1996 and Fiscal Year 1995
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Earnings per common and common equivalent share amounts are based on the
weighted average number of shares of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock
outstanding and the dilutive effect, if any, of outstanding stock options. The
sum of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock is used because the two classes are
identical except for certain transfer restrictions imposed on the Class A Common
Stock. The assumed conversion of these options was anti-dilutive for all periods
presented, and are thus excluded from the primary and fully diluted earnings per
share calculations.

On March 20, 1996, the stockholders of the Company approved a proposal to amend
the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company to effect a
one-for-eight reverse stock split of the Class A Common Stock and of the Common
Stock. All references to the number of Common and Class A Common shares and per
share data in the financial statements have been restated to reflect the reverse
stock split for periods ending December 31, 1995 or prior.

 The weighted average number of shares outstanding after the one-for-eight
reverse stock split used in the computation of primary and fully diluted
earnings per share is as follows (in thousands):

                         Fiscal Year 1996        Fiscal Year 1995

Fully diluted                   4,060                  4,060*

 * Restated for one-for-eight reverse stock split.
 
Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS- All reference to earnings per common share for periods
ending on December 31, 1995 or prior have been restated for the one-for-eight
reverse stock split.

Security Capital had net income of $125,000 for the three month period ended
December 31, 1996. This compares to net income of $12,000 for the same three
month period of the prior fiscal year. The Company reported no net income per
common share (after accrual for Class A Preferred Stock dividends) for the three
month period ended December 31, 1996 as compared to a net loss per share (after
accrual for Class A Preferred Stock Dividends) of $.02 for the same three month
period of the prior fiscal year.

As previously reported, Possible Dreams, Ltd., a Delaware corporation and a
subsidiary of the Company, acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed
certain liabilities of Possible Dreams, Ltd., and Columbia National
Corporation("Sellers"), both Massachusetts corporations, on May 17, 1996. The
Sellers were engaged in the business of designing, importing, warehousing and
distributing collectible Christmas figurines and ornaments and, to a lesser
extent, religious statues. Product sales of the Company increased to $5,073,000
and gross profit increased to $2,597,000 for the quarter, due to the addition of
Possible Dreams to the Company's consolidated financial statements. Selling,
general and administrative expense, which increased by $1,638,000 for the
quarter to $1,710,000, was also impacted by this event. The Company reported
operating income for the current quarter of $887,000 as compared to an operating
loss of $72,000 for the same prior fiscal year quarter. The current quarter
results reflect the seasonal nature of Possible Dreams business, which is
typically strongest in the third and fourth calendar year quarters. The Company
incurred interest expense of $507,000 for the current quarter as compared to no
interest cost for the same prior year fiscal quarter. This increase in interest
cost during the current quarter was attributable to debt incurred to acquire
Possible Dreams as well as borrowing incurred by Possible Dreams for working
capital during its busiest seasonal period.

The Company's percentage of the net revenues and expenses of Bowen, Miclette,
Descant & Britt ("BMD&B") is included under the caption "Income(loss) from Joint
Enterprise". The loss amounted to $211,000 for the three month period ended
December 31, 1996. This compares to a loss of $90,000 for the same period of the
prior fiscal year. BMD&B's income was down due to reduced commercial commissions
primarily due to the soft insurance market in the state of Texas.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $696,000 to $8,010,000 at December 31,
1996 as compared to $8,706,000 at September 30, 1996. The decrease in cash and
cash equivalents was primarily attributable to the payment by Possible Dreams to
the bank pursuant to its credit agreement with the bank. The Company's
consolidated working capital at December 31, 1996, however, increased by
$128,000 to $11,909,000 from $11,781,000 at September 30, 1996. This slight
increase in working capital was attributable to the seasonal nature of the
business of Possible Dreams.

Possible Dreams' lender has provided various credit facilities to Possible
Dreams, which includes funds to partially finance the acquisition of Possible
Dreams, refinance existing bank debt of the Sellers, provide for seasonal
working capital and letter of credit requirements and to pay transaction
expenses. These facilities consist of a revolving credit facility and $9,250,000
in amortizing term debt maturing from five to seven years from the closing date.
The Company, due to certain covenants in the credit agreement, is required to
pay down its revolving line of credit to $1,000,000 for a 15 consecutive day
period during the first quarter of each fiscal year after December 31, 1996.
Possible Dreams paid to the lender $7,884,000 in working capital loan payments
to comply with this covenant and $375,000 in term debt pursuant to its credit
agreement with the lender during the quarter.
 
The Company had no major capital expenditures during the quarter and expects no
major capital expenditures during calendar 1997. The Company is in the process
of completing the sale of its insurance brokerage business which is expected to
close during calendar year 1997. The Company believes that with the addition of
Possible Dreams, the cash flow of the Company's insurance agency affiliate,
Foster Insurance Services, Inc., proceeds from the sale of such business and
cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 1996, there will be sufficient cash on
hand to meet the Company's working capital and operating expenditure
requirements during calendar year 1997 and to compete for other acquisition
opportunities.

ITEM 3...DEFAULT UPON SENIOR SECURITIES

      (a)   None

      (b) The Company's Class A Preferred Stock bears a dividend of 15% per
      annum payable. Upon redemption or the liquidation of the Company,
      dividends on Preferred Stock are payable only out of cumulative net income
      since January 1990. (At a redemption date or upon the liquidation of the
      Company, accumulated but unpaid dividends are payable in full regardless
      of earnings since January 1, 1990.) Therefore, since there has been a
      cumulative net loss since January 1, 1990 of approximately $331,000,
      preferred stock dividends of $1,537,500 accrued from July 30, 1993 to
      December 31, 1996 were in arrears at December 31, 1996.
