1. General

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Ridgewood Power
Growth Fund (the "Fund") were prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial
information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation
S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes
required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the
financial position and results of operations and cash flows of the Fund have
been included. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period's
consolidated financial statements to conform to the current period's
presentation. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2005 are
not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2005. The consolidated balance sheet at December 31,
2004 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that
date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. For
further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and
footnotes thereto included in the Fund's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2004, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC").

The Fund was formed as a Delaware business trust in February 1997. The managing
shareholders of the Fund are Ridgewood Renewable Power LLC ("RPC") and Ridgewood
Power VI LLC ("Power VI") (collectively, the "Managing Shareholder").
Subsequently, Power VI has assigned and delegated all of its rights and
responsibilities to RPC and is essentially an entity that contains nominal
activity.

The Fund was formed to invest primarily in independent power generation
facilities, water desalinization plants and other capital facilities. These
independent power generation facilities will include cogeneration facilities,
which produce both electricity and heat energy, and other power plants that use
various fuel sources (except nuclear). In the past, the Fund invested in
opportunities outside of independent power generation facilities.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Fund, the US
Hydro Projects and the Egypt Projects. The Fund uses the equity method of
accounting for its investment in the United Kingdom Landfill Gas Projects (the
"UK Projects").

2.    Summary Results of Operations for Selected Investments

Summary financial information rounded to the nearest $1,000 for the United
Kingdom Landfill Gas Projects, which are accounted for under the equity method,
were as follows:

3.    New Accounting Standards and Disclosures

SFAS 153
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 153, Exchanges of
Nonmonetary Assets--an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. The guidance in APB
Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions ("Opinion 29"), is based
on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based
on the fair value of the assets exchanged. The guidance in Opinion 29, however,
included certain exceptions to that principle. This Statement amends Opinion 29
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive
assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary
assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has
commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to
change significantly as a result of the exchange. The Fund adopted SFAS 153
effective June 15, 2005, with no material impact on the consolidated financial
statements.

SFAS 154
In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections. SFAS No. 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, and
SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. This
statement changes the requirements for the accounting for, and reporting of, a
change in accounting principle and applies to all voluntary changes in
accounting principle, as well as changes pursuant to accounting pronouncements
that do not include transition rules. Under SFAS 154, changes in accounting
principle must be applied retrospectively to prior periods' financial
statements, or the earliest practicable date, as the required method for
reporting a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for years
beginning after December 15, 2005.

4.  Notes Receivable

The following is a summary of the Fund's notes receivable:

In the fourth quarter of 2004, US Hydro Projects' Blackstone entity and New
England Power ("NEP") agreed to terminate their 1989 power purchase agreement.
As per the terms of the Termination and Release Agreement, Blackstone now has
the right to sell its production of electricity to any party it chooses. In
addition, beginning January 2005 NEP is to pay Blackstone $16,000 per month
through February 2010 and a lump sum payment of $1,000,000 on February 15, 2010
to compensate Blackstone for the cancellation of the fifteen years remaining on
the original agreement.

5. Inventories

Inventories consist of spare parts, consumable products, fuel, goods-in-transit
and finished goods of the Egypt operations. Inventories are stated at the lower
of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling
price in the ordinary course of business, less the costs of completion and

6

selling expenses. An allowance is established for slow moving items on the basis
of management's review and assessment of inventory movements. Inventories
consist principally of spare parts, fuel and goods-in-transit of approximately
$539,000, $41,000 and $21,000, respectively, as of March 31, 2005. Inventories
consisted of spare parts and fuel of approximately $533,000 and $31,000,
respectively, as of December 31, 2004.

6. Long-term Debt

Following is a summary of long-term debt by project at March 31, 2005:

Sinai Environmental Services S.A.E. ("Sinai") has an outstanding loan and
interest payable of 13,899,936 Egyptian pounds (approximately US $2,391,000).
The loan bears interest at 11.0% per annum and is non-recourse to the Fund. A
provision of the loan restricts Sinai from paying dividends to its shareholders
or obtaining credit from other banks. The loan was in default prior to the
acquisition of Sinai by Ridgewood Near East and has remained in default through
the second quarter of 2005. In the second quarter of 2005, the bank and Sinai
resolved all issues and an extension and revised payment schedule was
formalized. The revised terms provide for progressive monthly payments over six
years ranging from 171,545 Egyptian pounds to 356,727 Egyptian pounds (or US
$29,451 to US $61,243 at loan inception exchange rates), including interest,
maturing on May 1, 2011.

During the third quarter of 2002, Ridgewood Egypt For Infrastructure ("REFI")
executed a term loan agreement with its principal bank. The bank provided a loan
of 12,500,000 Egyptian pounds (approximately US $2,022,000), which matures on
March 31, 2007. The loan is being repaid in quarterly principal installments of
781,250 Egyptian pounds (approximately US $134,000 as of March 31, 2005).
Outstanding borrowings bear interest at the bank's medium term loan rate plus
0.5% (12.5% at March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004).

Five of the US Hydro Projects' hydro-electric power plants are financed by a
term loan ("term loan"). The Fund has a choice of variable or fixed interest
rates on the term loan. Variable rates are LIBOR (2.38% fixed for one year
starting June 2004) plus 1 3/4% or the Lenders Corporate Base Rate (as defined).
At the Fund's option, a fixed interest rate can be selected, payable on any
portion of the debt in excess of $1,000,000, for any period of time from two to
seven years. Such fixed rate shall be based on the US Treasury note rate at the
date of election plus 2 3/4%. The variable rate of 4.13% was the effective
interest rate at March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. This credit facility is
collateralized by five hydroelectric plants and notes receivable owned by the US
Hydro Projects. Although the Fund is current in its interest and principal
payments, it is technically in default under the covenants of the term loan as a
result of not providing its Lender a copy of one of its subsidiary's current
audited financial statements. As per the terms of the term loan agreement, the
default does not allow the Lender to accelerate or call the loan.

During the fourth quarter of 2003, discussions were entered into with the
Truckee-Carson Irrigation District ("TCID") to sell the US Hydro Projects notes
receivable and cash flow rights from one of its projects (the Lahontan project)
to TCID. In the first quarter of 2004, TCID's Board of Directors approved the
purchase. In return for its notes receivable and cash flow rights, the US Hydro
Projects received $4,000,000. Pursuant to the term loan agreement, the US Hydro
Projects submitted the proceeds it received from the sale of the notes
receivable directly to its lender on March 31, 2004. As a result of the sale and
remittance of the proceeds, the balance of the term loan was reduced to
approximately $1,700,000. Of the proceeds received, $3,958,386 was applied to
the principal balance and the remaining $41,614 was applied to current interest
due. The parties mutually agreed to amend the term loan agreement, providing for
a revised amortization of principal for the $4,000,000 payment.

7. Other Liabilities

As of March 31, 2005, other liabilities include the future discounted principal
payments aggregating $1,361,742 net of current portion, that is part of the
termination agreement with two consultants that provided marketing, construction
and management services in Egypt (as discussed below).

In February 2003, a complaint was filed against Ridgewood Near East by a
corporation claiming breach of consulting contract. In November 2003, the
parties reached an agreement whereby Ridgewood Near East paid the corporation a
one-time payment of $280,750, representing commissions and penalties, and agreed
to continue making required commission payments as per the original agreement of
$900,000 payable in monthly installments of $7,500. The Fund recorded the
liability by discounting the future payments at the rate of 10% resulting in
total liability of $504,237 and $513,969 as of March 31, 2005 and December 31,
2004, respectively.

In the first quarter of 2005, Ridgewood Near East terminated an agreement with a
former consultant, who previously operated under an arrangement whereby the
consultant provided marketing, construction and management services in Egypt. As
per the termination agreement, Ridgewood Near East will pay the consultant
$120,000 per year over the remaining life of the project. The Fund discounted
the future payments over 15 years which represents the estimated useful life of
the Egypt Projects. As per the terms of the agreement, the Fund will make
quarterly installments of $30,000 starting April 1, 2005 and, accordingly,
recorded the liability by discounting the future payments at the rate of 10%
resulting in a total liability of $927,260 as of March 31, 2005. Based on future
events, it is possible that the useful life of the Egypt Projects may exceed 15
years which would result in costs exceeding the amount accrued as of March 31,
2005.

The Fund recorded the current portion of future discounted principal payments of
$69,755 to accrued expenses. Schedule of future discounted principal payments
(net of current portion) as of March 31, 2005 are as follows:

     2006 (9 months)               $    57,052
     2007                               82,988
     2008                               91,647
     2009                              101,210
     2010                              111,772
     Thereafter                        917,073
                                   -----------
         Total                     $ 1,361,742
                                   ===========

8. Related Party Transactions

From time to time, the Fund records short-term receivables and payables from
other affiliates in the ordinary course of business. The amounts receivable and
payable with the other affiliates do not bear interest. At March 31, 2005 and
December 31, 2004, the Fund had outstanding receivables and payables with the
following affiliates:

8

On June 26, 2003, the Managing Shareholder of the Fund entered into a $5,000,000
Revolving Credit and Security Agreement with Wachovia Bank, National
Association. The agreement allows the Managing Shareholder to obtain loans and
letters of credit for the benefit of the trusts and funds that it manages. As
part of the agreement, the Fund agreed to limitations on its ability to incur
indebtedness, liens and provide guarantees. On February 20, 2004, the Managing
Shareholder and Wachovia Bank amended the agreement increasing the amount to
$6,000,000. The agreement has subsequently been extended to September 2006.

The Managing Shareholder waived the management fee for the three months ended
March 31, 2005.

9. ZAP

As an incentive to exercise the warrant it received in the reorganization of
ZAP, the Fund received a second warrant, which was exercised in December 2004
with the purchase of 538,462 shares at $3.25 per share. As of December 31, 2004,
the Fund did not sell any of the shares it purchased from the exercise of the
second warrant and recorded an investment of $1,750,000 to reflect the shares
held at market value. During the first quarter of 2005, the Fund sold 92,000 ZAP
shares to third parties which resulted in a loss of $35,356. The Fund recorded
an unrealized loss in the remaining 446,462 ZAP unrestricted securities of
$245,553, which is included in shareholders' equity, at March 31, 2005 due to
the decrease in the market price of ZAP securities from $3.25 (December 31,
2004) to $2.70 (March 31, 2005).

10. Foreign Currency

The cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment, which represents total
accumulated other comprehensive loss, is included in shareholders' equity at
March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 and amounts to a loss of $7,711,203 and
$8,253,824, respectively.

11. Commitments and Contingencies

Two of the US Hydro Projects hydroelectric plants have leased the site at their
facility under a long term lease which terminates in 2024. Rent expense for the
quarters ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 was $198,677 and $198,680, respectively.

Minimum lease payments at March 31, 2005 are as follows:

                2005 (9 months)                        $   388,750
                2006                                       695,000
                2007                                       700,000
                2008                                       710,000
                2009                                       720,500
                Thereafter                               5,495,977
                                                         ---------
                  Total Minimum Lease Payments         $ 8,710,227
                                                       ===========

In accordance with Egyptian company law, the Egypt Projects transfer 5% of
annual net profits to a statutory reserve. Transfers will cease when the reserve
reaches 50% of issued capital. The statutory reserve is not eligible for
distribution to members. The statutory reserve amounted to $92,205 and $87,408
as of March 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively.

13. Subsequent Events

During October 2005, the management fee to the Managing Shareholder accrued for
2004, 2003, and 2002, aggregating $1,623,690, was forgiven. The aggregate
management fee forgiven was recorded as a capital contribution by the Managing
Shareholder in the fourth quarter of 2005, who also anticipates assigning said
contribution for the benefit of the investor shareholders.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

The following information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
consolidated financial statements and the associated notes thereto of this
Quarterly Report, and the audited consolidated financial statements and the
notes thereto and our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2004, as filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

Dollar amounts in this discussion are rounded to the nearest $1,000.

Introduction

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Fund, the U.S.
Hydro projects and the Egypt Projects. The Fund uses the equity method of
accounting for its investment in the UK Projects.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

For a complete discussion of critical accounting policies, refer to "Significant
Accounting Policies" in Item 7 of the Fund's 2004 Form 10-K. There have been no
substantive changes to those policies and estimates.

Outlook

The adoption of the renewable portfolio standard ("RPS") regulations in
Massachusetts is indicative of the significant activity and movement in the
industry, as well as at state and federal governments, to increase the amount of
renewable power that is supplied to utilities that serve end-use customers in
various states. In Massachusetts, legislation and regulations have been passed
requiring such retail electric suppliers to have in their electric portfolio one
(1%) "new renewable power" for 2003. This renewable generation percentage
requirement increases each year until the renewable generation amount equals
four (4%) percent. New Jersey, Nevada, California and Connecticut have passed
similar RPS legislation.

Notwithstanding the development of a renewable energy market in many states, the
general trends in the electric power industry have continued to reflect an
attitude of caution and restraint. Throughout the United States, memories of the
California energy crises, Enron Corp's bankruptcy, proceedings before the FERC
regarding certain questionable practices of other energy producers and
marketers, as well as the general US and world economy and the Iraq War, have
led many to call for a more regulated electric industry, with strict reporting
requirements and cost of service regulation. However, many legislators,
regulators and market participants have not disavowed deregulation.

The Projects owned by the Fund's UK operations, which are not subject to the
PowerBank arrangements, operate under long-term contracts with the Non-Fossil
Fuels Purchasing Agency, a quasi-governmental agency. They enjoy a guaranteed
price and market for their output and are not subject to price fluctuations for
their fuel. The UK Projects are relatively unaffected by developments in the
United Kingdom electricity markets, which included the introduction in 2001 of
the New Electricity Trading Arrangements ("NETA"). NETA replaced the electricity
pool with a competitive wholesale energy market. While NETA has not impacted the
income stream for the UK Projects, the attendant disruption has caused a
realignment and consolidation within the UK utility industry. The industry
regulator, Office of Gas & Electricity Markets ("OFGEM"), monitors these
developments on a continuous basis.

The Egyptian Projects are developed at remote resort hotel sites on the Red Sea,
which are distant from other electric and water sources. As a result, the
Egyptian Projects are relatively unaffected by trends in the Egyptian water and
power industry, which is concentrated along the Nile River and Mediterranean
Coast. Prices for power and water delivered to the Egyptian Projects hotels are
based on contracted rates. Some contracts are short-term and in other cases,
hotels may attempt to renegotiate the terms of their contracts. The market price
for water not under contract varies depending on many factors, including fuel
cost, availability of other sources of supply (primarily other desalination
plants or the Nile River), demand (which is heavily dependant on temperature)
and availability of transportation (primarily trucks and pipelines).

Results of Operations

Three Months Ended March 31, 2005, compared to the Three Months Ended March 31,
2004

Total revenues increased $250,000 to $2,915,000 in the first quarter of 2005.
Revenues of the US Hydro Projects increased approximately $99,000 as a result of
higher outputs due to increased precipitation. Revenues from the Egyptian
Projects increased by $151,000 primarily due to higher Egyptian water
desalinization operations resulting from pickup in tourism in 2005.

Cost of revenues increased $178,000 in the first quarter of 2005 from $1,736,000
in the first quarter of 2004. The increase is primarily due to $99,000 in higher
operating costs at Sinai and REFI resulting from increased sales and also due to
increase in depreciation and amortization expense by $87,000 resulting from
additions to plant and equipment.

Gross profit increased from $929,000 in the first quarter of 2004 to $1,001,000
in the first quarter of 2005. The increase in gross profit is a result of the
increased revenues in both Egyptian and US Hydro Projects, partially offset by
increase in operating expenses of Egyptian Projects.

General and administrative expenses increased $1,075,000 to $1,573,000 for the
first three months of 2005. The increase is primarily due to the termination
agreement with a former consultant which resulted in a charge of $927,000 which
represents the present value of the future discounted payments.

The management fee to the Managing Shareholder was waived for the first quarter
of 2005 compared to the $411,000 fee recorded in the first quarter of 2004.

Loss from operations increased by $593,000 from income from operations of
$20,000 in the first quarter of 2004 to loss of $573,000 in the first quarter of
2005. This increase in loss is primarily attributable to the increase in general
and administrative expenses, partially offset by the waiver of the management
fee in the first quarter of 2005.

Interest income increased by $24,000 from $1,000 in the first quarter of 2004 to
$25,000 during the same period in 2005. The increase is attributable to the
interest earned on the note receivable resulting from the cancellation of the
Blackstone Project's power purchase agreement with New England Power.

Interest expense for the first quarter of 2005 was $153,000 compared to $213,000
in 2004. The decrease is primarily due to the pay down of the debt assumed in
the US Hydro acquisition and the outstanding borrowings under the credit line of
the Egypt Projects.

In the first quarter of 2005 the Fund recorded an equity loss of $65,000 from
the United Kingdom Landfill Projects, compared to $198,000 in the first quarter
of 2004. The decrease in equity loss is a result of the UK Projects experiencing
increased revenues driven by increased capacity.

During the first quarter of 2005, the Fund recorded loss on sale of investment
in ZAP securities of $35,000 which represents 92,000 ZAP securities sold at a
loss.

In the first quarter of 2004, the Fund recorded a net gain of $175,000 on the
sale of the note receivable held by the U.S. Hydro Projects. The 2004 gain
represents $200,000 on the sale of the Lahontan note receivable held by the U.S.
Hydro Projects, partially offset by legal fees of $25,000 incurred on the sale
of the note.

Other expenses increased by $31,000 from other income of $7,000 in the first
quarter of 2004 to other expense of $24,000 in the first quarter of 2005. The
increase in other expenses is primarily due to Egyptian foreign exchange loss
resulting from purchase of equipment from various international third parties in
the first quarter of 2005 compared to foreign exchange gain in the prior year.

The Fund recorded income tax expense of $19,000 in the first quarter of 2005
compared to tax benefit of $159,000 during the same period in 2004. In 2005, the
Fund recorded a deferred income tax benefit of $90,000 compared to $159,000 in
the first quarter of 2004. In the first quarter of 2005, the Fund also recorded
$109,000 in current state tax expenses. The Fund's Egyptian subsidiaries have a
ten year income tax holiday that expires in 2010. Accordingly, no provision has
been made for Egyptian income taxes in the periods presented.

12

Minority interest in the loss (earnings) of subsidiaries increased from earnings
of $162,000 in the first quarter of 2004 to a loss of $243,000 in the first
quarter of 2005. This increase is primarily due to the increase in loss from the
Egyptian Projects resulting from increase in general and administrative
expenses.

Net loss increased by $389,000 from $211,000 in the first quarter of 2004 to
$600,000 in the first quarter of 2005. This is primarily the result of the
increase in loss from operations and gain on sale of US Hydro note recorded in
the first quarter of 2004. In addition, increase in net loss is due to increase
in income tax expense and minority interest loss allocation. This is partially
offset by the decrease of equity in loss of United Kingdom Landfill Gas
Projects.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At March 31, 2005, the Fund had cash and cash equivalents of $608,000, a
decrease of $161,000 compared to December 31, 2004. The decrease is the result
of the $851,000 provided by operating activities, the $480,000 used in the
investing activities, the $568,000 used in financing activities and the $36,000
positive effect of the exchange rate on cash and cash equivalents.

Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2005
was $851,000 compared to $1,226,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2004.
The decrease in cash flow compared to 2004 is primarily due to the decrease in
short-term payable to affiliates and accrued expenses partially offset by
increase in other liabilities resulting from the termination agreement of a
consultant in Egypt.

Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2005 was
$480,000 compared to cash provided of $3,845,000 for the three months ended
March 31, 2004. In 2005, cash used in investing activities includes $359,000 in
distributions from the United Kingdom Landfill Gas Projects, $264,000 in
proceeds from the sale of investment in ZAP securities, partially offset by
capital expenditures of $119,000 and $1,008,000 of deposits made on purchase of
equipment by the Egyptian Projects. In 2004, investing activities primarily
includes $3,975,000 in proceeds from the sale of the US Hydro note receivable.

Cash used in financing activities for the first quarter of 2005 was $568,000
compared to $4,451,000 in the first quarter of 2004. In 2005, cash used in
financing activities includes $332,000 in cash distributions to shareholders and
$236,000 of repayments under bank loans. In 2004, financing activities includes
$332,000 in cash distributions to shareholders and $4,118,000 of bank loan
repayments.

The Fund expects that its cash flows from operations and cash on hand will be
sufficient to fund its obligations and any declared distributions through March
31, 2007. The Fund has historically financed its operations from cash generated
from its subsidiaries' operations. Obligations of the Fund are generally limited
to payment of the management fee to the Managing Shareholder and payments for
certain administrative, accounting and legal services to third persons.
Accordingly, the Fund has not found it necessary to retain a material amount of
working capital.

The following schedule represents the Fund's total contractual obligations as of
March 31, 2005:

In February 2003, a complaint was filed against Ridgewood Near East by a
corporation claiming breach of consulting contract. In November 2003, the
parties reached an agreement whereby Ridgewood Near East paid the corporation a
one-time payment of $280,750, representing commissions and penalties, and agreed
to continue making required commission payments as per the original agreement of
$900,000 payable in monthly installments of $7,500. The Fund recorded the
liability by discounting the future payments at the rate of 10% resulting in a
total liability of $504,237 and $513,969 as of March 31, 2005 and December 31,
2004, respectively.

13

In the first quarter of 2005, Ridgewood Near East terminated an agreement with a
former consultant, who previously operated under an arrangement whereby the
consultant provided marketing, construction and management services in Egypt. As
per the termination agreement, Ridgewood Near East will pay the consultant
$120,000 per year over the remaining life of the projects. The Fund discounted
the future payments over 15 years which represents the estimated useful life of
the Egypt Projects. As per the terms of the agreement, the Fund will make
quarterly installments of $30,000 starting April 1, 2005 and, accordingly,
recorded the liability by discounting the future payments at the rate of 10%
resulting in a total liability of $927,260 as of March 31, 2005. Based on future
events, it is possible that the useful life of the Egypt Projects may exceed 15
years which would result in costs exceeding the amount accrued as of March 31,
2005.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

There has been no material change in the Fund's assessment of its market risk
since its presentation set forth in Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk," in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2004.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), our management with the participation of our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2005. The system of
disclosure controls and procedures was designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in this report and other reports we file under
the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms. This includes
disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by us is accumulated and communicated to our senior management
so as to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our evaluation
disclosed material deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures. The
material deficiencies identified as of March 31, 2005 are as follows:

     (a)  Accounting Systems and Financial Reporting Software. We have concluded
          that the lack of automation and integration in our accounting systems
          and financial reporting software utilized during 2004 did not permit
          us to timely comply with our financial reporting responsibilities for
          2004. In 2003 we began to address this by arranging for the
          replacement of our then existing accounting systems and financial
          reporting software. However, the process of migrating from the then
          existing systems and software to the new systems and software was not
          completed until the latter part of 2004 and we did not have the full
          benefit of the automation and integration features of the new system
          and software for that year. We believe that the new accounting systems
          and financial reporting software constitute a significant improvement
          in our disclosure controls and procedures but a comprehensive
          assessment of the effectiveness of these improvements can only be made
          in subsequent periods when the new accounting systems and financial
          reporting software have been fully implemented and are fully
          operational.

     (b)  Personnel Resources. We have determined that additional accounting and
          financial reporting staff with relevant experience is necessary to
          maintain and operate the new accounting systems and financial
          reporting software and to develop and administer additional disclosure
          controls and procedures to enable us to comply with our financial
          reporting obligations. The following changes in our staffing have
          occurred:

                    (i.) Five existing accounting positions and one legal
                    support staff position have been upgraded by staffing with
                    personnel having enhanced experience and/or training;

                    (ii.) Two new accounting positions have been created and
                    filled;

14

(iii.) A new full-time Director of Compliance and Reporting
                    position has been created and filled;

                    (iv.) A new full-time Director of Tax Reporting and
                    Compliance position has been created and filled and replaces
                    a prior part-time consulting arrangement; and

                    (v.) The Chief Financial Officer was replaced by a new Chief
                    Financial Officer.

          We believe that the substantial upgrades and expansion of the
          accounting and financial reporting staff and legal support staff will
          result in material improvements in our disclosure controls and
          procedures, but the evaluation of these new personnel upgrades and
          additions can only be made in subsequent periods when we review
          personnel performance under these new arrangements.

     (c)  Additional Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We have determined that
          additional disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for our
          U.S. operations to ensure that we will meet our financial reporting
          and disclosure obligations in an accurate and timely manner. We
          implemented the following additional disclosure controls and
          procedures with respect to the U.S. operating facilities in which we
          have an ownership interest:

                    (i) Weekly budgeting of cash receipts and disbursements with
                    a roll-forward of budgets based on actual results;

                    (ii) Formal procedures to evaluate new contractual
                    arrangements and amendments and/or terminations of existing
                    contractual arrangements and to provide accounting personnel
                    with supporting analysis and documentation;

                    (iii) Adoption of a standardized format for the reporting of
                    the output, sales, prices and expenses for the operating
                    facilities in which we have an ownership interest; and

                    (iv) For facilities having material amounts of inventory,
                    adoption of formal procedures for quarterly physical
                    inventory observations with corresponding adjustments to
                    financial statements.

     We believe that these additional disclosure controls and procedures have
     addressed the material deficiencies in disclosure controls and procedures
     that we have previously identified, but we believe that the internal
     control process is constantly evolving and we expect that additional
     disclosure controls and procedures will be added from time to time as
     deficiencies are discovered. Evaluation of the effectiveness of these
     enhanced disclosure controls and procedures must wait until later periods
     when we will have the ability to review the results of these controls and
     procedures in operation.

     (d)  Foreign Operations. We have interests in foreign operations in the
          United Kingdom and Egypt. Each of these foreign operations is managed
          by a separate in-country staff that includes management, accounting,
          engineering and support personnel. Each of the U.K. and Egyptian
          operations delivers to us audited financial statements prepared in
          accordance with the legal requirements and auditing standards of the
          U.K. or Egypt, as the case may be. We have concluded that there exist
          material deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures as
          applied to these foreign operations, as follows:

          (i)  The audited financial statements for the U.K. operations were not
               timely delivered to us because of an extended review of the
               proposed U.K. accounting treatment applicable to a material
               financing transaction of the U.K. operations. This delay in the
               receipt of the U.K. audited financial statements contributed to
               our delay in completing our financial statements for the year
               ended December 31, 2003. In 2004, we implemented additional
               procedures relating to the preparation of the U.K. financial
               statements, and the 2004 audited financial statements of the U.K.
               operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 were delivered to
               us in a timely manner.

15

(ii) Disclosure controls and procedures in the Egyptian operations
               relating to the administration and reporting of contractual
               relationships were not properly applied during 2004, with the
               result that a contingent guarantee by an Egyptian parent entity
               of a subsidiary's obligations was not properly disclosed and thus
               not reported on the books and records of the Egyptian parent
               entity. We have taken steps to establish additional disclosure
               controls and procedures to ensure timely disclosure and recording
               of all material contractual arrangements. In addition, the then
               existing Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer
               of the Egyptian operations have been replaced. We believe that
               these actions address the identified material deficiencies in our
               disclosure controls and procedures in the Egyptian operations.
               However, assessment of the effectiveness of these actions must
               wait until subsequent periods when we can assess the new
               personnel's performance under these new procedures.

     (e)  We have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures relating
          to the reporting and analysis of material events, including those
          requiring disclosure on Form 8-K or otherwise, were not effective in
          all circumstances to ensure that such events were brought to the
          attention of the appropriate personnel in a timely and accurate
          fashion. In response to this deficiency, we have established a
          Disclosure Committee consisting of the Chief Executive Officer, the
          Chief Financial Officer and the General Counsel to review events that
          may require disclosure by us. In addition, the Disclosure Committee
          has promulgated reporting procedures under which operating personnel
          are required to inform the Disclosure Committee of material events. We
          believe that the use of a Disclosure Committee and reporting
          procedures for material events addresses the deficiency in our
          disclosure controls and procedures relating to events that may require
          disclosure and will allow us to make timely decisions regarding
          required disclosures.

     (f)  Additional Reviews. We have retained an accounting firm to undertake
          an independent review of our disclosure controls and procedures and to
          report the results of such review to us. We expect to receive such
          report during the second quarter of 2006.

As a result, our management under the supervision of our Chief Executive
Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report pursuant to Rule
13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act and concluded that, as of the end of the period
covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures did not provide
reasonable assurance of effectiveness because of the material deficiencies noted
above.

Other than the changes discussed above, there were no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2005 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably like to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

Forward-looking statement advisory

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as with some other statements made by the
Fund from time to time, contains forward-looking statements. These statements
discuss business trends and other matters relating to the Fund's future results
and the business climate and are found, among other places, in the notes to
financial statements and at Part I, Item 2, Management's Discussion and
Analysis. In order to make these statements, the Fund has had to make
assumptions as to the future. It has also had to make estimates in some cases
about events that have already happened, and to rely on data that may be found
to be inaccurate at a later time. Because these forward-looking statements are
based on assumptions, estimates and changeable data, and because any attempt to
predict the future is subject to other errors, what happens to the Fund in the
future may be materially different from the Fund's statements here.

Some of these are changes in political and economic conditions, federal or state
regulatory structures, government taxation, spending and budgetary policies,
government mandates, demand for electricity and thermal energy, the ability of
customers to pay for energy received, supplies and prices of fuels, operational
status of plant, mechanical breakdowns, availability of labor and the
willingness of electric utilities to perform existing power purchase agreements
in good faith. Some of the cautionary factors that readers should consider are
described in the Fund's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.

16

The Fund therefore warns readers of this document that they should not rely on
these forward-looking statements without considering all of the things that
could make them inaccurate. The Fund's other filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and its offering materials discuss many (but not all) of the
risks and uncertainties that might affect these forward-looking statements.

By making these statements now, the Fund is not making any commitment to revise
these forward-looking statements to reflect events that happen after the date of
this document or to reflect unanticipated future events.
