ECHLIN INC.
          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

NOTE 1. General:
- ----------------
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for
interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and
Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the
information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting
principles for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of
management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments)
considered necessary for a fair statement have been included.  Operating
results for the three-month period ended November 30, 1996 are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year
ending August 31, 1997.  For further information, refer to the consolidated
financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the company's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 1996.

NOTE 2. Business Combinations:
- ------------------------------
During September 1996, the company acquired Long Manufacturing, Ltd.
(Long), headquartered in Oakville, Ontario, Canada, for approximately
$158.8 million.  Long manufactures and distributes motor vehicle heat
exchange products and air-conditioning evaporators to original equipment
manufacturers and aftermarket customers.

In October 1996, the company acquired Nobel Plastiques SA (Nobel), located
in France and Spain, for approximately $16 million. Nobel manufactures
fluid, hydraulic and pneumatic servo control lines.

Both acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting.

NOTE 3. Borrowing Arrangements:
- -------------------------------
Commercial paper, domestic notes payable and certain notes payable with
foreign banks at November 30, 1996 have been classified as long-term debt
because of the company's intent to refinance this debt on a long-term basis
and the availability of such financing under the terms of the company's
revolving credit agreement.  The weighted average interest rates at
November 30, 1996 were 5.4% for commercial paper, 5.8% for domestic notes
payable and 3.3% for foreign notes payable.

NOTE 4. Sale of Business:
- -------------------------
During October 1996, the company sold certain assets of Sensor Engineering,
a division of the company that manufactures cards and readers for access
control systems, for $11.4 million.  The pre-tax gain resulting from the
sale, in the amount of $7,283,000, was deducted from selling and
administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of
income.  The gain on the sale added $0.07 to earnings per share for the
quarter.

       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

Note 5. Subsequent Event:
- -------------------------

During December 1996, the company acquired the outstanding common
stock of Iroquois Tool Systems, Inc., a brake rotor manufacturer,
located in Erie, Pennsylvania by issuing 335,474 shares of common
stock.  This acquisition will be accounted for as a pooling of
interests and as a result the financial statements for fiscal 1997
will be restated during the second quarter to include Iroquois
results.

MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

Results of Operations:
- ----------------------

Net sales for the first three months of fiscal 1997 increased
$132,278,000 or 18.5% as compared to the same period a year ago. 
This growth was primarily due to the acquisitions of EPIC Technical
Group, formerly known as the Automotive Segment of Handy & Harman,
and Long Manufacturing Ltd.

Net sales of comparable operations, those part of Echlin for at
least twelve months, rose 4.0%.  Domestic comparable operations rose
5.3% while foreign comparable operations were 1.0% above a year ago. 
Domestically the sales growth was due to the introduction of new
products, price increases and a slight increase in unit volume.  The
non-U.S. operations sales increase was attributable to price
increases and the introduction of new products, partially offset by
lower unit volume and the effect of translation.  European heavy
duty operations began to experience weaker customer demand during
the period.  

Gross profit to sales for the quarter declined 1.7% to 25.4% as
compared to the prior year.  This quarter we experienced higher than
normal returned goods from U.S. warehouse distributors and retailers
which have adversely impacted margins.  In addition, weak customer
demand around the world caused us to lower production levels,
resulting in unabsorbed overhead costs.

Selling and administrative expenses increased $15,029,000 or 11.2% 
over the prior year. The percentage of selling and administrative
expenses to sales declined 1.2% to 17.6% from a year ago.  The
dollar increase was primarily attributable to expenses generated by
acquisitions, offset in part by the pre-tax gain of $7,283,000 from
the sale of Sensor Engineering.

Net interest expense increased $76,000 over the previous year due to
higher average debt levels, which was partially offset by lower
domestic short-term borrowing rates.

                   MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

Liquidity and Sources of Capital:
- ---------------------------------
During the first three months of fiscal 1997, operations used
$33,610,000 of cash vs. $14,238,000 used during the same period last
year.  Higher cash outflows due to timing of liability payments were
partially offset by improved cash inflows for accounts receivable.

During the quarter the company's debt levels, excluding amounts
added by acquisitions, increased $235,552,000.  These funds were
used to fund acquisitions, working capital requirements and capital
expenditures.
 
The ratio of total debt to total capital was 43% at November 30,
1996 as compared to 33% at August 31, 1996 and 38% at November 30,
1995.
